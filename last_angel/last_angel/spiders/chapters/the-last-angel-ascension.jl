He told himself that it was inevitable, that no matter what last twitchings there were, the rains would fall. If he had not been here, then another would give the order. He was no more than an interchangeable cog in the ugly march of destiny. That offered very little consolation. He was the one who was here and it would be by his order that billions would burn.", "Standing in his ship\u2019s main observation deck, the Noble Fleet Lord stared down at the world he was fated to murder. Next to him, the astronauts were weeping. \u2018Astronaut\u2019... a quaint, archaic word that had passed out of common usage in the Askanj Principality, but it was one that came the closest to what these men and women were. They\u2019d cast themselves out into the stars on primitive, nuclear-powered ships all in the dream of exploration and discovery. Now, they were looking over their world, a planet they\u2019d never expected to see again and they were crying. Thren said nothing, remaining in quiet repose beside the astronaut\u2019s commander, waiting for the inevitable.", "Life was a precious thing, so rare as to be miraculous just for existing. To achieve sapience was rarer still. He\u2019d always believed that life-giving world and every species should be regarded as intrinsically worthwhile because of that. Hundreds of billions of stars in the galaxy and only the barest fraction would give birth to a sapient race. That made every thinking species valuable in its own right, worthy of preservation. Species death was an action that the Principality had before never committed, but today it would destroy the Oshan people.", "At least, what was left of them.", "From here, nothing looked wrong at all. The Oshan homeworld was a planet of oceans and jungles, deserts and mountains. It had a more severe axial tilt than Lillitur and its weather patterns were both more unpredictable and severe, but that had proven no impediment to the rise of sapient life. Oshans were one of the stranger breeds that Thren had encountered, on the far side of what could be considered humanoid, with grotesquely thin limbs, double-thumbed hands, skin the colour of a dead Askanj-anj and pupil-less eyes like broken gems. To Thren\u2019s eyes, they were to the last detail, hideous and misshapen, like a child\u2019s terrified scribblings of monsters, but that made their sorrow not one iota less real.", "Thren had heard it before, many times. The Enemy held it as one of the pillars of their civilization. They called it the Valthus Lesson, as a reminder of a people that they had lost. Artificial intelligence, trans-organic studies and any other advanced cybernetic research was banned under severe penalty of law, up to and including death. Thren, like many others in the Principality, had laughed at that. How could anyone cut themselves off from those fields of study and still claim to be truly advanced beings? Oh, the Principality knew about Enemy\u2019s troubles with the Devoured. That had been over two millennia ago, doubtlessly exaggerated and embellished by time. Imagine, holding onto an irrational fear for two thousand years! \u2018Superior, civilized\u2019 beings, indeed!", "Looking down at Oshanta, Thren could no longer see how he and his fellows had derided the Enemy for their irrationality. The scoffing disdain and amusement was gone, replaced with a deep and chittering terror. Upon seeing this for themselves, his own nation would follow the Enemy\u2019s decisions. They would have no choice. His own sister was a cybernetics researcher, working on creating mind uploads. Just four months ago, she had excitedly messaged him about her first successful animal trials. What he did here would destroy her life\u2019s work. He wanted to regret that. He wanted it very badly, but he couldn\u2019t. Instead, he simply hoped that she would forgive him.", "The surface of Oshanta was a fertile mix of blue and green. No soot-choked skies, or pathogenic spread of technology choking out all life. It was a beautiful world. Mountains, oceans, deserts and jungles. There were cities. Massive hive structures taller than any Thren had ever seen, spiderwebs of mag-rails and roads cutting through each of them, linking each metropolis across landmasses and shallow seas. Trains flashed back and forth, ferrying resources from mining sites to industrial centers. Aircraft plied the skies, ships heaved through the deeper oceans pregnant with cargo, each machine networked into the horror whose mind spanned that globe.", "Two hundred years ago, the Oshan people had created an artificial intelligence. Thren didn\u2019t know what they had had in mind for it. Perhaps it had been intended to run their civilization. Perhaps it had been one of many. Its creators had given it two primary directives: protect its own existence and ensure the proliferation and happiness of the Oshan people. Doubtless there had been many additional clauses, sub-clauses and determinants, but those were the intelligence\u2019s two main goals. Those were still its goals.", "There\u2019d been no war. No revolution, no nuclear bombs falling on cities, no steel-skinned soldiers marching through cities. Nothing so dramatic. The Oshan AI had done as it was bade, streamlining every aspect of society to be more efficient and to provide for all, to make its people happy. That was very important to it.", "It had been small steps. First, implants that connected people directly to the global information network. To be able to communicate with anyone in an instant. Medical implants for those that suffered from chronic pain, chemical imbalances or debilitating conditions. Automatic release of painkillers and hormones to alleviate suffering. Then, everyone could trigger a rush of pleasure at any given moment. As the machine assumed more and more control, Oshanta became a more perfect world. Poverty, crime, conflict... all of them sputtered and fizzled on their way to extinction.", "Thren didn\u2019t know the exact moment that the Oshan civilization ended. There was no single instant that he could point to and say \u2018this is when the machine took over\u2019 with any certainty. It had been gradient, a slope its people had slid down decade after decade. The machine did what it was intended to; it served the Oshan people. It made them happy. Now... now there were no Oshan people, save for the few hundred astronauts aboard Vivisector. There were things that shared the same genetic code, that began life in the same way... but they weren\u2019t people. Not really.", "Now, Oshans were produced like cattle. Gametes were combined in a laboratory, genetic defects and disease corrected. Children were grown in artificial wombs and once mature, they were taken apart. Painlessly, of course. What was left of them was installed in a support frame or incubation tank. Nutrients went in, waste came out. For the rest of their very long lives, implants inserted into their brains kept them in a perpetual state of bliss, even as it flash-imprinted information into their consciousness (it had been told that one thing that made organics happy was to learn and grow). It had been told that work and challenges made people fulfilled, so originally it gave them jobs, installing their support frames into mechs, trucks and airplanes, building them bodies of any style for any profession, from the unapologetically machine-like forms to perfect simulacra of their original bodies. Their minds had been hooked into its own systems, letting them \u2018work\u2019 in a half-aware dream state, while it corrected their errors and kept them busy, letting them feel that they were accomplishing something.", "If they wanted more challenges, it had provided for them. They had explored the deepest parts of Osha\u2019s oceans, climbed its highest mountains, penetrated its most isolated jungles, flown through air and more, all in a perpetual state of happiness. More and more though, the scraps of their species desired to sleep. To give themselves completely over to the bliss their god-machine could provide for them. Now, the massive edifices of its cities were filled with ever-dreaming Oshans, over seven hundred billion of them. The machine cared about them. It wanted to keep them safe, keep them happy and do exactly as it had been programmed to. Whatever they wanted, it had offered and if all they wanted was to sleep, it obliged.", "To ensure it was functioning as it was intended, the machine would occasionally query one of these people. It would ask if it was doing well and with the conviction of addicts across the galaxy, they would tell it that it was doing everything perfectly and that they only wanted more. They created no works of art, wrote no sonnets, achieved no scientific breakthroughs. Oshanta was a world without hunger, without fear, without war, without suffering. Where an entire people were preserved like insects in amber and their child reigned over all.", "Decades before the machine\u2019s creation, another Oshan dream had been realized. Intrepid Voyager, the first of four colony ships was launched towards Osha\u2019s closest celestial neighbour. The largest, grandest achievement of their people to date as the years passed, three more siblings followed it, the long, lonely convoy headed towards the nearest solar system, the ships crawling at sublight for a journey that would last decades, their passengers in dreamless cryostasis.", "The Oshan AI had wanted them back. Not out of malice towards them, nor fear of them being outside of its control, but because it wanted to make them happy. It had built spaceships of its own and launched them after the wayward colony ships. As they had approached each vessel, the AI ships had seized control of their systems and brought them back to Oshanta, to join their tank-born brothers and sisters. Only Intrepid Voyager had been spared, their watch crews confused and wondering as communication with ship after ship ended. Someone on the last vessel had figured out what was going on and managed to send a terrified plea to Intrepid Voyager: \u201cRun! Run! They\u2019re coming for you next! For all gods\u2019 sake, run!\u201d", "In fear, the astronauts had broadcast a cry of their own into the outer darkness, hoping against hope that someone might hear it. APAV Duskbloom had, tracking the source of the alien transmission to the primitive Oshan vessel. The automata were swiftly dispatched. Seven months later and the Oshan astronauts had come home aboard an Askanj Argosy armada.", "They\u2019d stood aboard his Vivisector, listening as the machine had proudly detailed the history of its world and all it had done. And why not? It was doing exactly as it had been told to. Even now, the machine was still calling out to the Oshans, beseeching them to come down. One of its creators had been one of the colonists\u2019 father. It used his face when it talked.", "+i am here,+ over and over, it pleaded with a dead man\u2019s smiling face. +i want to help+ It couldn\u2019t imagine why anyone would resist it.", "It did not like Thren, nor did it like the Askanj task force. It considered them to be holding its people hostage and was insisting that they be released. The Noble Fleet Lord had refused and so, the machine turned itself to a purpose it had never before considered: war.", "Missile silos were being built. Launch platforms were being constructed with horrifying speed as spacecraft were constructed in the hundreds. The machine had assured Thren that this did not indicate a perpetual state of hostilities between itself and the Askanj Principality. It simply wished that the astronauts be returned, as its programming insisted that it protect them. The machine didn\u2019t comprehend that none of them wanted to join their fellows and it believed that their statements in this regards were the result of duress. It further assumed their entreaties to shut itself down and to awaken its billions of charges were evidence of malicious intent on the task force\u2019s part. It knew it was operating correctly. It was ensuring the continuation of the Oshan people and their enduring happiness. Anything that attempted to disrupt that function must therefore be hostile.", "Still, it had assured the Noble Fleet Lord that if he were to release his \u2018hostages\u2019 and forsook all attempts at harming itself or its population, it would carry out no retaliation. As insane as it seemed, Thren believed that promise. Even then, he might have avoided the inevitable. Some would argue that he should do just that: turn the astronauts over and quarantine the Oshan system for all time. Let it have its people and let the entire race sleep in the beds they\u2019d built.", "Any who said that were fools. The AI had spoken to him in great detail. It had access to all the Oshan understanding of aliens, from the most clich\u00e9d invasion stories, to the philosophical debates of great religious and philosophical minds. It had determined that the Oshans had believed that, in the absence of conflict, aliens should be considered to be sapient beings worthy of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Therefore, it assured Thren and the Oshans both, once the current issue was resolved, it would act as its creators had intended. It would bring pleasure and happiness to every other sapient race in the galaxy, assuring both its own survival and their own. It genuinely did not understand why anyone would oppose such a goal. It had been told that its efforts would be opposed. It apologized for that, but now that it had a new goal. It would protect all life, just as it did the Oshans. If it were opposed, it would \u2018subdue\u2019 all aggressors, just as it was planning to do to Thren and his fleet.", "The space around Oshanta was choked with orbital mirrors, satellite transmitters, suborbital craft and defences in plenty. It had been preparing for seven months, concerned that its population might be in danger. The planet\u2019s single small moon was covered with construction facilities and there were other ships moving between the worlds of the system. Seven months and it had built an interplanetary industry. The technology was crude compared to that of the Argosy, but it was learning. Experimenting, researching, developing and testing. Every second that passed for them was a week, a month or year for the intelligence.  In another seven months, it might develop transition technology and be able to reach other stars. He couldn\u2019t allow that. He\u2019d asked for options, even though he\u2019d feared from the very beginning what his decision would be. His senior staff and the Oshans had debated \u2013 argued \u2013 for days. Several of his officers had believed so strongly that this was wrong, they had filed written protests. That was their right, but in the end there had been unanimity, resigned and despairing though it was.", "The doors to the lounge opened and Thren\u2019s aide Quick to Bite slithered in. The Askanj-ilth came up next to his superior and bowed his head. \u201cThe fleet is in position, lord. All final checks have been completed.\u201d", "\u201cThank you,\u201d Thren said. He turned to the Oshan expedition leader, C\u2019hrit\u2019ta. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d The dreadful moment was here. No more delays, no more ticks left in the clock. Destiny\u2019s march might be delayed, but never abated. Sooner or later, the moment would come.", "The tall, gangly being looked up. His cheeks were wet and was holding his partner close. The woman was a biochemist, but Thren could not place her name at the moment. He looked back to the world beneath Vivisector. \u201cThere\u2019s... there\u2019s nothing, is there?\u201d He asked a final time. Many of the Oshans had argued, begged, pleaded when Thren had made his decision, but at last, they had relented. Some of them had agreed. Others had merely understood. Their child could not be allowed out into the galaxy.", "Thren looked out the windows. He was silent for a moment. \u201cNo,\u201d he answered again. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing.\u201d He could not allow this thing to exist. Now that it was aware of the existence of other beings in the galaxy, it would never stop trying to help them. Fragments of Devoured code had destroyed an entire species. If any part of this abomination survived, it would start all over again. He couldn\u2019t allow that. He couldn\u2019t risk any other species suffering the same fate of the Oshan people.", "C\u2019hrit\u2019ta closed his eyes. \u201cDo it.\u201d", "The Noble Fleet Lord looked over at Quick to Bite and gave a simple hand gesture. The aide spoke into his comm and the order was given.", "Rain fell upon Oshanta.", "Vivisector fired first. A beam lanced from the battleship\u2019s side and struck what had once been a nation\u2019s capital city. Thirty-two megatons of destructive force boiled the air and sent a superheated blastwave roiling through streets and alleys, toppling buildings, shattering metal and concrete. Within the same heartbeat, the rest of the task force opened fire. The Oshan astronauts cried out. Some had refused to be here for this. Others had wanted to see it. Missiles burst in the atmosphere, electromagnetic pulses frying circuitry and sending aircraft crashing to the ground. Beams struck half-completed silos, bombs shattered mining and research facilities. In the void, destroyers obliterated helpless construction ships. Oshanta\u2019s moon burned as the task force\u2019s guns fell upon it as well. Nothing was spared. Several of the Oshans fled the room. Another fell to her knees and vomited. Seven hundred billion.", "It took days. Days of relentless bombardment to make sure every deep-ground bunker was destroyed, every communications node was melted, every bit of hardware on every planet and moon was rendered inoperable. Nothing could be left to chance.", "Through it all, the machine never stopped crying out. +why?+ It pleaded like a child, unable to understand what it had done wrong. +why?+ Finally, blessedly, it was silent. The rains ended. Oshanta was no longer blue and green. Its moon was a tortured ruin, the system strewn with wreckage.", "Three of the astronauts killed themselves during the bombardment and another two afterwards. C\u2019hrit\u2019ta and his mate were among them.", "The Enemy hated and feared all artificial life. Now, Thren finally understood why. The Oshans had done everything right. They hadn\u2019t been stupid or careless. Their creation hadn\u2019t rebelled, it hadn\u2019t gone insane. It had done precisely what it was intended to do. The Principality had thought that that would be enough, that any artificial intelligence simply needed the correct set of directives and it would operate flawlessly. Now they had come to the same bitter realization as their most hated enemy. As his fleet headed back to Principality territory, Thren sat at his desk and fervently hoped that his sister had not made any breakthroughs in the time he\u2019d been gone.", "~", "Chapter 1:", "Two thousand, five hundred years later:", "Grace Sharon Proctor awoke as the light from Shuruppak filtered through the window. It wasn\u2019t a real window: her quarters were in the officers\u2019 decks, within Nemesis\u2019s armoured central core, hundreds of meters from the crippled warship\u2019s outer hull, but it transmitted the image from the external sensors, rendering it in as perfect detail as if it truly were a window. She\u2019d keyed the window on a timer, to let it work as a gentle alarm clock. Grace murmured softly, struggling to get up. It wasn\u2019t easy, not when she was in entangled in her lover\u2019s arms.", "Grace tried to shrug off one long mottled blue limb, sighing when it resolutely refused to budge. Abandoning subtlety, she pushed her elbow back into her partner\u2019s ribs. A displeased hiss was the response. \u201cGet up,\u201d the human insisted.", "\u201cNo.\u201d Allyria te Neu answered. The other woman burrowed her face into Grace\u2019s hair. \u201cI\u2019m warm and comfortable.\u201d", "\u201cSo am I, but we still have to get up,\u201d Grace repeated, trying to free herself. That was easier said than done. Allyria was a Verrish; just over eight feet tall, long-limbed and sinewy, she had one leg and arm draped over the smaller human and seemed to be in no hurry to move.", "\u201cNo, we don\u2019t.\u201d Allyria wasn\u2019t really that lazy, but when she found a comfortable position, she was as determined not to move as a cat staking out a sunbeam. \u201cThere\u2019s no drill advocates to scream at us here.\u201d", "\u201cLydia and Marcus will be waiting. I think we\u2019re already late. Now, come on.\u201d", "Sighing defeat, Allyria disentangled herself from Grace, sitting on the edge of the bed. Shuruppak\u2019s orange light gave her mottled blue skin a slight greenish hue. Her wide yellow eyes were slit-pupiled like those of a cat. Her small nostrils flared as she inhaled, her long tongue tasting the air before she yawned, long canines glinting. Her tintas, the many quasi-prehensile head-tails that hung from her scalp, stirred lazily as if in a breeze. They were a darker shade of blue than the rest of her skin, the rows of sensory cells that ran along them giving them a faint stippled pattern. If you squinted, you could be forgiven for thinking that they were scaled. Allyria\u2019s classmates \u2013 and even one or two of her superiors \u2013 had disparagingly referred to her as Medusa.", "She leaned over and gave Grace a remonstrating nip on the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s cold.\u201d", "\u201cAir circulation\u2019s still not working right,\u201d Grace replied, pulling a shirt on and running her fingers through her dark blonde hair. She picked up Allyria\u2019s bra and handed the garment over. Despite the differences between them, Verrisha and humans were possibly more physically alike than any other two races in known space. There was even a running theory that the two species were somehow distantly related, but as far as Grace was aware, that was nothing more than a persistent rumour attempting to explain a quirk of evolution. Still, it was an important point for the fringe theorists who believed in the Seeders, a mythical precursor race that had spawned life throughout the galaxy. Others claimed that the similarities between humans and Verrisha was proof of each species\u2019 bestiality. Evolution itself had made their primitive physiologies and mindset utterly obvious and so the sins of one could safely be passed to the other.", "At those thoughts, Grace bit her lip, her nostrils flaring. Until recently, she would have believed much the same. Not to such an extent, but she would have accepted that humans were \u2018less\u2019 than other races, as were the Verrisha. It wasn\u2019t their fault, it was just the nature of things. She looked over at Allyria, reaching out and gently wrapping her fingers around one tinta, stroking her grip down it. Allyria let out a pleased murmur. Tintas were quite sensitive, each of the other girl\u2019s head-tails was filled with nerve clusters that could detect an array of sensory information including scent, heat and even the movement of air. It gave them superb spatial awareness, akin to a personal scope unit. It was no surprise that Verrisha were among the best hunters in the galaxy. It was also no surprise that they were often stereotyped as simple, predatory animals that had somehow cudgeled a civilization together despite having no trace of true intelligence. Even at her worst, Grace had thought that had been an unfair exaggeration.", "She\u2019d believed it when it was said about humans, though.", "Allyria picked her pendant up off the nightstand, nimble fingers hooking the clasp at the back of her neck. She\u2019d had it for as long as Grace had known her. The pendant itself was a simple design, a single blue eye shedding a red tear. The gems were not terribly expensive, but it was priceless all the same. It was a keepsake from her mother, the only thing of her homeworld that Allyria had.", "Their home was cold. The blankets itched, half the systems didn\u2019t work right and those that did tended to glitch. Despite all that, Grace wouldn\u2019t have traded it for anything. She and Allyria were free... and the only cost was to betray everything and everyone they\u2019d ever known.", "Fortunately, they weren\u2019t the only ones that had made that choice.", "~", "Grace ran. Her footsteps echoed through empty corridors, sweat running down her back. Allyria was next to her, the long-legged Verrish easily capable of outrunning the human, but she kept pace effortlessly. They ran past closed doors, silent hallways and darkened rooms. This deep inside the warship, you could barely notice most of the damage. That was confined to the outer decks. Repairs were slow, but still progressing. Grace planted her hands on a pile of crates and vaulted them easier than she\u2019d ever done in her life. She\u2019d always been in shape \u2013 just keeping up with Allyria throughout their childhoods and then spending four years in the Rally Military Academy had made sure of that \u2013 but she\u2019d never been this fit. Part of her knew that that was because there really wasn\u2019t all that much to do besides train, study and exercise, but another part of her knew that she wanted to be better than she had been. She refused to be \u2018Broken\u2019 any longer, refused to bend the knee to a nation that despised her.", "The Compact of Species was the greatest civilization in galactic history. It had survived six thousand years of threats from without and within, enduring, prospering and growing. It protected weaker, less developed races from those that would try to harm or exploit them, while supporting their development and preparing them for the moment when they would join their older, wiser brethren in ruling. It brought civilization to the galaxy. Medicine. Knowledge. It warded them from harm, shedding blood on their behalf. Humanity was one such client race. One of the rarest species in the galaxy, four billion among quadrillions of sapient beings. One world and a handful of miniscule colonies amidst millions, the wreckage of a people who depended on the Compact for everything.", "They were always told how grateful they should be.", "Marcus and Lydia were waiting at the halfway point. Each of them had been a year behind Grace and Allyria at the Academy. Both of them had been recruited to the Compact Janissary Corps. All of them were from Kiel Point, Rally\u2019s capital, but only Grace herself had the slightly olive hue of a Kiel Point native. Lydia had rust-coloured hair and grey-blue eyes indicating some Northfall ancestry. Sectator Kilgrave had once described the younger girl as \u2018pale as an Irish fucking ghost\u2019. Grace had never been quite sure what \u2018Irish\u2019 had to do with anything and she suspected that Kilgrave hadn\u2019t, either. It was just a linguistic bit of flotsam left from the world humanity had used to have.", "Marcus was almost Lydia\u2019s complete opposite. Lydia was from a working-class household, but like Grace Marcus was from Kiel Point\u2019s upper middle class, although she suspected that his family had been more \u2018upper\u2019 than hers. Both her parents were doctors; she didn\u2019t know what his did. He didn\u2019t talk about his family. Or much else. He was dark-skinned, with a regulation buzz-cut and brown eyes that often seemed to be holding a private joke, one that was completely different from what he was telling you. He unsettled Grace. Given their circumstances, that was saying something.", "Both former Janissaries were already soaked with sweat. \u201cMorning,\u201d Lydia nodded as they fell into step with Grace and Allyria. Marcus nodded mutely. It was a tradition the four of them had fallen into, completing this last leg of the run together. Grace and Allyria had their own route, just as Lydia did. Marcus usually had his own regime, but had started joining the women for this part of their morning exercises. A simple way to connect before they began their individual duty shifts, even if there wasn\u2019t that much to talk about.", "\u201cYou two are behind schedule. Long night?\u2019 Lydia asked with a teasing grin.", "Grace bit her lip, but she was already flushed from her run and no one noticed the additional reddening of her cheeks. Her relationship with Allyria wasn\u2019t a secret, but it was still something she preferred not to comment on. Lydia knew that and this was her way of gently tweaking the older girl. As upperclassmen and provisional sectators, Grace and Allyria were technically Lydia and Marcus\u2019s superiors,  though their ranks and most of the formality that had gone with them had been thrown out the window when the four of them had turned on their classmates and superiors.", "Grace had been getting groomed for command. Though Allyria had received starship tactical training, it had been clear that she would eventually lead soldiers like Marcus and Lydia. The Compact knew where best to put each person based on their aptitude, their psychological profiles and social assimilation scores \u2013 how well they \u2018fit in\u2019. At one time, Grace had craved that guidance. Now she recognized it as just another leash. Still, turning her back on her entire life hadn\u2019t been easy. She almost hadn\u2019t. Twenty-one of her classmates had been offered the same choice and refused it.", "For Allyria, the decision had been one she\u2019d made years ago. She\u2019d never seen it as treason, because her loyalty had never been to the Compact. Her homeworld was a \u2018protectorate\u2019. Her people were, like humanity, a client race of the greatest, most eminently civilized nation in the galaxy. The Verrisha were known as \u2018Brutes\u2019. Violent, governed by aggression and base passions. Always angry, resistant, defiant. They had needlessly opposed annexation, though they had teetered on the brink of a world-wide apocalypse. They would have preferred dooming their own people rather than accept the Compact\u2019s guidance. Such was the short-sightedness of the younger, less civilized races.", "The Verrisha needed to give up their intransigence and embrace the ideals of the Compact. Under the precept of educating the violent, barbarous people of Vara, the Compact had initiated the Envoy Children program. Allyria had been one of hundreds of thousands of children selected for the honour. She\u2019d been taken from her parents and brought to Rally, given a human foster family with the intent of being raised with \u2018appropriate cultural precepts\u2019 and \u2018assimilating appropriately into civilized society\u2019. Even if not physically or intellectually impressive, humans were fine members of the Compact and it was only natural that Rally would host so many of the Envoy Children. The \u2018Brutes\u2019 would be tended to by the \u2018Broken\u2019.", "And we are, weren\u2019t we? Grace thought angrily. Her teachers had always been a little fuzzy on its location, but she\u2019d seen Earth for herself. Nothing had cemented her belief that turning on the Compact was the right thing than seeing her species\u2019s home. Earth was a dead world: brown and grey, ringed by the wreckage of its shattered moon, every trace of life utterly eradicated.", "The history she\u2019d learned called it the Cataclysm, a disaster brought on by humanity\u2019s ignorance. The Verrisha had slouched towards ruination, teetering on the precipice of self-annihilation, but humanity had fallen to their own barbarity. Just what the disaster had been was always appropriately vague, of course. Records were lost or destroyed. Human short-sightedness and stupidity had caused it \u2013 that part was always quite clear. Overpopulation, environmental collapse, disease, famines and war and then near-extinction as the poor, stupid humans tore themselves apart. Such was the fate of all young, uncivilized peoples.", "A bare handful of ships had escaped the Cataclysm, though. Crude and primitive things, unable to travel faster than light without killing a third of their passengers, they had found Rally and descended into barbarism, nearly dying out completely when an asteroid strike destroyed what little industry they had. It was only the timely arrival of a Compact scientific expedition that kept Homo sapiens from becoming a footnote in galactic history. Saved from their own short-sightedness by the generosity and mercy of their betters, the burden of civilizing this backwards, fly-bitten species was accepted without hesitation by the greater races. It was their responsibility, after all. One day humans would join the elite of the galaxy as comrades and equals. It would take time, time to ensure that the Broken were truly civilized, truly capable of earning their place, but until that day came, the Compact would be there. Protecting, guiding, encouraging, supporting. One day.", "The histories didn\u2019t mention that it was the Compact who burned Earth. That humanity hadn\u2019t had just one world, but dozens upon dozens. That they hadn\u2019t had primitive, crew-killing starships. They had spread across the stars in hope and optimism until they had made the gravest mistake imaginable, one too many other species and nations did. They looked at the Compact and said \u2018no\u2019.", "Ten years later, the Confederacy was gone. Half a century after that humanity was declared extinct. It was luck that a handful of ships had survived the culling, running for more than a century and a half, ruining their own systems so thoroughly that when they arrived in orbit of their new colony world, none of their vessels were spaceworthy. And then... the punchline of a cruel joke. Their new home was struck by asteroids, destroying the few scraps of civilization that the survivors had managed to preserve.", "That was the irony: if a Compact exploration fleet hadn\u2019t found the world, humanity may actually have gone extinct. Two centuries removed from their nation\u2019s attempt at genocide, the scientists had been elated to discover these scraps of a thought-to-be dead race. There had been some concern that the \u2018racial madness\u2019 that had \u2018forced\u2019 the Compact to order species death might still be within these wretched survivors, but by the time those in the Compact who remembered humanity could act on the information, the elated scientists had already made their discovery known far and wide. Thus Rally, humanity\u2019s last world became a part of the Compact and its miserable, destitute population of starving survivors were laughingly branded Broken.", "Grace had been one of them. Always trying to fit in, always following the lead of people she\u2019d believed in and trusted. She\u2019d argued with Allyria so many times. She\u2019d been elated when her friend had started to follow her example. That she\u2019d become a role model for the other Envoy Children had made Grace so proud of her. Now, she couldn\u2019t look back on those memories without shame and her cheeks burned even more, sweat running down her back, her heart pounding in her throat. Next to her, Allyria and her fellow traitors \u2013 her fellow free humans \u2013 continued their run through the half-lit corridors of their new home.", "~", "Once upon a time, Grace had taken daily showers for granted. Now,  warm running water was one of the few luxuries that the small crew had. It was one that Grace was always thankful for, and she leaned into the spray, letting the water wash over her face, her dark blond locks plastered to her neck and back. She was growing her hair out. In the Space Force, there had been strict regulations about human hair, as it was an irritant to Tribunes. Most humans who served directly under a Tribune superior ended up shaving their heads or undergoing electrolysis. Letting her hair grow was just another small sedition that Grace enjoyed. She opened her mouth, droplets pattering on her tongue. The water was clean and it lacked the tang that Grace had grown used to. Rally\u2019s public water supplies were chemically enriched for the Tribune population. There were no proven adverse effects in humans, but it had always tasted... off.", "The stall was comfortably sized for a single person and could fit two well enough, providing those two were human-sized. It was something a more ticklish fit with an eight-foot-tall Verrish present but Grace didn\u2019t mind sharing. Allyria purred (well, it wasn\u2019t really a purr \u2013 Verrisha didn\u2019t have the voice box for it \u2013 but it was long, low and happy) as she tilted her head down, letting the water spatter over her tintas. She was ticklish at the base of them. \u201cHere,\u201d Grace said, reaching up and sliding her hands into the morass of tendrils. Her mother was a kinesiologist. She\u2019d seen in Allyria what her foster family hadn\u2019t and brought the hurting, angry girl into the Proctor household, enduring her rages and finding a way to connect with her that no one else had. In the process, she\u2019d learned more about Verrish physiology than many other people and Grace had learned from her. Allyria\u2019s purr deepened as Grace massaged her tintas. \u201cNo headache today?\u201d Allyria was prone to them. Despite hosting so many Envoy Children, there\u2019d never been enough Verrish-specific painkillers in stock at the local pharmacies. Anna Proctor had found a different method, stimulating the pressure points on Allyria\u2019s head tails, just as an acupuncturist might for a human client. That was one of the things Grace had learned from her.", "\u201cNo,\u201d the taller girl replied. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to stop.\u201d", "Grace made a reproving tch. Verrisha tintas were very sensitive and she knew every pressure point, probably better than her mother did.", "Okay, maybe not \u2018probably\u2019...", "The ones she was touching now were... there was no direct translation in English or Compact Standard, but the gesture was as untoward as a handshake or pat on the back. Well... perhaps it was a bit more familiar than that, but not by much. Verrish were a very tactile species; certainly more than humans and what the latter saw as comfortable personal space, the former considered isolation and standoffishness. Physical contact was as necessary to Verrish as conversation was to humans. Too many foster families hadn\u2019t understood that, remonstrating their charges for being too \u2018grabby\u2019, \u2018needy\u2019 or \u2018invasive\u2019, starving them of simple comforts and connections when they needed them most.", "Verrisha had two tintas that were larger than the others and Grace ran her fingers down the left one, tickling the other girl. Okay, so that was more than a little familiar.", "\u201cStop,\u201d Allyria giggled, making a half-hearted attempt at a swat.", "\u201cNah,\u201d Grace responded. She switched to the tight tinta. \u201cDon\u2019t want to.\u201d", "The Verrish bit her lip, trying to stifle her outburst. When she laughed, it was high-pitched and staccato, almost like a hyena. Grace\u2019s human friends had thought it was creepy and weird, but Grace found it adorable. She\u2019d never said so before. She should have, but as recompense, she now took a definite amount of delight in teasing Allyria until she did laugh. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep it in forever,\u201d she said matter-of-factly, twisting her palm against the soft, smooth skin she was holding. Allyria shook her head, not trusting herself to speak, but Grace was correct and within seconds the taller girl was yelping with laughter.", "Grace grinned. Definitely not \u2018probably\u2019.", "~", "\u201cGo on, set them up again. When you get back, I\u2019ll let you have a turn.\u201d", "\u201cYou promise?\u201d", "The shot echoed through the firing range. A score counter flashed and Marcus de Vries smiled. Boom, he thought with satisfaction. Headshot. His chosen tool a bolt-action rifle. In a galaxy filled far more advanced personal weaponry, such a design was both archaic and anachronistic. That made it not one iota less lethal in the right hands, though. Marcus liked the rhythm of the bolt action. It felt... soothing. You had to make each bullet count. It required more concentration, more focus than a clip-fed sniper rifle and as a result, each kill shot was just a little bit extra special.", "The young man popped the spent casing out, setting it on its base next to a line of others. There were eleven so far. They were all set in front of a grainy picture of a young woman with blue hair and matching eyes, with skin even paler than Lydia\u2019s. The girl was younger than Marcus. The image had been made decades ago on Rally, one of the many photos and video clips taken of the young woman during her arrest and trial. Rally\u2019s greatest shame, that\u2019s what they called her, living proof of Broken barbarity. She\u2019d killed a Tribune. Not with a rifle, but that scarcely mattered to Marcus. This picture was his favourite. A reporter had asked her how she felt about murderering not just one of the ruling members of the Compact, but a man who\u2019d spent decades serving Rally and its human population with diligence and care. She\u2019d given the reporter his answer, uttering words that you just didn\u2019t say on Rally, as close to heresy as was possible. She\u2019d smiled before she\u2019d spoken. Before he\u2019d found that image, Marcus had only seen that type of expression on his own features.", "Slowly, the young man drew the bolt back, sliding a new round into the chamber. He\u2019d always found shooting relaxing. There was nothing like it. The slowing of breath, the gentle touch of your finger on the trigger, the soft, steady exhalation and then... then whatever you were looking at died. On Rally, he used to hunt a mix of native and introduced animals; rabbits, wailing grouse and black boars. He\u2019d used a bolt action then, too. Of course, after that unfortunate incident with Glen, he hadn\u2019t been allowed to go hunting by himself anymore. Marcus never understood what the fuss had been about. It wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d actually shot the other boy. But oh how he\u2019d jumped!", "Marcus smiled as he looked through his rifle\u2019s scope. He could see it again in his mind\u2019s eye. That moment of Glen\u2019s confusion turning to worry. The other boy calling out to him, telling him that the joke wasn\u2019t funny anymore. He\u2019d known that he could have taken the shot and put a bullet between Glen\u2019s big brown eyes. He\u2019d always wondered what it would be like. To not see wood chips or shards of glass go flying, not to pick off some stupid animal that never even knew he was there, but to see all that confusion and fear end with the gentle squeeze of a trigger.", "He\u2019d had to wait years after that day for that moment, but it had been everything he\u2019d hoped for. When he\u2019d joined Red One, she\u2019d promised him two things: the first was that he could find out what it felt like to kill a Tribune. He had. It felt better than he imagined, the thrill only made better at knowing he was only one of a handful of humans who had done what he\u2019d done. The second thing...", "As the holographic targets came back online, Marcus shifted his attention back to the range, sparing only a moment to wink at his inspiration, her smile of satisfaction a mirror to his own.", "I can\u2019t wait.", "~", "\u201cLydia Andrea Jameson. What is this? Another letter from the school? What have you been doing this time?\u201d", "Lydia picked herself up off the deck, wiping her mouth with the back of one hand. She was learning how to use a pair of tonfas. She\u2019d only gotten knocked down three times so far; better than yesterday. She was a quick study. Her mother had always said that. In the last few years, there\u2019d always been a barb on the end of the compliment, spoken or not: if only you learned something. Despite what its Provisional Government claimed, Rally was not the picture of compliance that it might appear at first glance. There were still parts of the population that were \u2018non-compliant\u2019, citizens who did not adequately assimilate into society. There was even the occasional spat of unrest, tepid and watered-down though it was. Proctor had been infamous for getting caught in the security checkpoints around her district and she\u2019d been one of the good ones. Not like Lydia. Lydia was a troublemaker. Asking too many questions, demanding better answers, acting up in unacceptable ways. By the time she had enlisted in the Academy, she and her mother had barely been on speaking terms.", "The young woman rose to her feet and began circling her opponent, holding each tonfa by its grip \u2013 \u2018nigirii\u2019 in the long-dead language of the weapon\u2019s makers. No, she hadn\u2019t been good. That was why it had been determined that she should serve in the Janissary Corps. She\u2019d broken into her counselor\u2019s office and read his recommendations.", "Subject is estimated on to be a 3.8 on the Kiener-Wernham social assimilation index, the report had stated. Indelible resistance to authority, unacceptable levels of aggression and a consistent pattern of rejection of social norms and doctrines. Repeated failure to comply with appropriate behaviours. Subject has difficulty forming emotional connections with properly socially-assimilated individuals. Frequent association with other ongoing and potential maladaptives. I don\u2019t feel that she would benefit from further counselling. Instead, I\u2019m forced to recommend conscription to the Ground Force or the Janissary Corps. If that fails, chemical behaviour modification is the only option. Knowing that that talk was coming hadn\u2019t made sitting through it any easier. When her counselor had talked about her options, he\u2019d tapped on the back of his head, just where the implants would go. The ones that would moderate her \u2018inappropriate\u2019 behaviour. So she\u2019d joined the Rally Provisional Space Force as a member of the Janissary Corps and learned to keep her mouth shut.", "Lydia\u2019s hands tightened on the weapons\u2019 grips. Her opponent carried tonfas as well, ready to administer another beating. It was roughly human sized and human shaped, one of the vessel\u2019s combat drones. Sleek-bodied, and faceless, its chassis was pitted and dented from its recent deployment, but its function was unimpaired. Its responses had been dialed down so that she could learn instead of getting her ass kicked in the space of a heartbeat. It matched her movements, its own weapons held up in a guard stance.", "The girl probed her mouth with her tongue. No bruises yet. \u201cCome on, Alan,\u201d she told the machine. \u201cLet\u2019s try that again.\u201d", "~", "Allyria was holding Grace off the floor with one hand, bracing her against the wall. With the other, she stroked the human\u2019s face, trailing a fingertip along the faint scars that jagged from Grace\u2019s forehead to her cheek. Verrish talons were curved and wickedly sharp, held inside their fingers like those of a cat. She\u2019d had to keep them dulled while serving the Compact, but even filed down, they had left marks.\u201cAre you going to let her heal those?\u201d She asked that question every day.", "\u201cMaybe tomorrow,\u201d Grace replied, taking Allyria\u2019s hand and kissing each fingertip. She knew Allyria was ashamed of what she\u2019d done, but Grace didn\u2019t mind the marks. It could have been much worse. Allyria hadn\u2019t done it out of malice or anger, nor was it the result of one of the many arguments they\u2019d had when they were younger. Allyria had never raised a hand against her, even during their loudest, angriest fights. Instead, she\u2019d done it to save Grace\u2019s life. Allyria was eight feet of muscle and easily weighed several hundred pounds. There\u2019d been no way Grace could have lifted her up; she would have gone over the edge as well. Both of them had known that the fall would be fatal, but Grace had refused to let go, so Allyria had made her. Hanging over the lip of the elevator shaft, Grace had been certain that she\u2019d just watched her oldest friend die.", "...and then an angel reached out her hand.", "Grace didn\u2019t even know why she kept the scars, but it felt important to her. At first, they\u2019d been a symbol of what she thought she\u2019d lost. Now... now, they meant something different, something she couldn\u2019t have put into words. Not yet. Maybe tomorrow she would have them fixed.", "Maybe.", "Still held aloft, Grace ran her hands up Allyria\u2019s arms, sliding them into the mass of tintas. She also knew where the intimate spots were... and the sudden pleased growl told her that she\u2019d found at least one. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be late,\u201d Allyria breathed huskily, a smirk on her lips. Despite the admonishment, she leaned in, raking her teeth gently over Grace\u2019s skin and the smaller girl shivered with pleasure.", "\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Grace whispered, pulling her lover closer as the water poured down.", "Maybe tomorrow.", "~", "Grace stepped off the elevator into the Hall of the Dead. It was really just the main access to the starship\u2019s command deck. On the vessel\u2019s schematics it was given the wholly utilitarian designation Corridor Black-Seven, but Grace had thought of it in more descriptive terms, even if she\u2019d never said the name aloud. There were no corpses or coffins here, but the hallway was flanked by empty suits, trophies from failed attempts to take the ship. Each of them was marked by a single, lethal indicator of how its bearer had fallen: bullet-shattered visors, laser-burned cuirasses, blade-pierced backplates. The types of equipment ranged from EVA gear for engineers and operations crews to power armour from Janissaries and Blackened and beyond. There were suits from nations that Grace had barely heard of and others completely foreign to her, each of them mounted and displayed as if they were waiting to be used once more.", "The oldest dated back twenty centuries; the newest was from a few weeks ago. It was a point of pride as well as a way to erode the morale of attackers \u2013 those who made it this far. Though some determined attempts had reached Black-Seven, none of them had survived beyond it. No one set foot on Nemesis\u2019s command deck that was not allowed to.", "The thick, interlocking double blast doors that led into command opened for Grace, heavy battle steel gliding almost noiselessly along their treads. Like all of its other primary systems, the warship\u2019s bridge was set deep inside its hull, inside the second layer of battle armour that protected its most vital areas. To breach any one of them would take a concerted and prolonged bombardment. To date, that had had happened only a handful of times in the warship\u2019s lifetime and despite the fearful damage the ship had recently endured, its central core was undamaged.", "There was a flicker of crimson light and the image of a woman dead for two thousand years appeared. In life, she would have been pretty. Olive-skinned, with an easygoing, lopsided smile and a genetic quirk of dark green eyes. She hadn\u2019t been \u2018Broken\u2019. She\u2019d been human, free and defiant until she, along with the rest of her crew had been killed in battle, her entire civilization falling shortly after. All that was left of her or anyone from that nation was within the mind of the being that inhabited this ship, the one that had taken her first and only captain\u2019s form as a way to honour the dead.", "\u201cWelcome, Ensign Proctor,\u201d Earth\u2019s last soldier said, her crimson avatar turning towards the main holo tank that sat on the upper dais of command.

Her entire exposure to the concept of artificial intelligence had been through the Compact\u2019s lens. Machines didn\u2019t feel. They calculated and determined. If by some chance they actually had emotions at all, it was as a shadow of organic thoughts and feelings. Detached, aloof, cold. Perfectly in keeping with their inorganic mindsets.", "There was nothing at all cold about Nemesis\u2019s artificial intelligence.

Entire worlds had been reduced to scarred cinders by her rage, armies turned to ash and the screaming crews of starships butchered without hesitation or remorse.", "Humanity\u2019s greatest accomplishment was its most unforgivable sin. Artificial intelligences were banned by the Compact and by the Askanj Principality, the two largest and oldest nations in existence. It was one of the very rare bits of common ground between the two.

Four thousand years ago, the Compact had been riven by a war unlike any other as one of its founding races embraced trans-organicism and turned on their flesh-bound brethren. They were only destroyed through terrible losses and unimaginable suffering. Three thousand years ago, the merest remnants of that defeated race resulted in the genocide of one of the ruling species of the Compact. Twenty-five hundred years ago, the Askanj burned an entire solar system to destroy a \u2018friendly\u2019 artificial intelligence. Two thousand years ago, Red One murdered a god.", "The outcome of the conflict between the United Earth Confederacy and the Compact of Species was as predictable as it was inevitable.

The Confederacy\u2019s wars of unification was many decades behind it, whereas the Compact was in a perpetual cycle of expansion and border wars as it brought \u2018stability\u2019 to other nations and peoples. The Confederate Navy was laughably outclassed by the Compact Space Force, only surviving as long as they had due to their distance from the Compact at large and the time it took their opponent to muster their fleets. Despite all of that, human tenacity surprised the Compact and the war dragged on far longer than anticipated as the Confederacy accumulated victory after victory, costly though each was.", "Humanity\u2019s defiance enraged the Space Force Leadership. Those sigil officers and politicians who\u2019d expected and promised the Inner Council a short, victorious war found themselves being asked why it was taking so long to subdue a single species whose warships were not even given the dignity of the name. Soon, questions to explain became demands to account. To be humiliated in such a manner by such a primitive, belligerent, unworthy species was intolerable.", "To settle the matter once and for all, the Compact sent forth three of their god-ships, their Triarch\u2019s Chariots. Dreadnaughts. Fleet-killers, invincible to everything that Earth had thrown at them. In desperation, the Confederacy had commissioned the construction of prototype dreadnaughts of their own, the Nemesis-class \u2018deep space fleet engagement vessels\u2019. After the failures of earlier AIs, the Confederacy had been loath to try again... but in the face of enslavement, they had had no choice. Nemesis and its unborn sisters carried experimental systems that could only be operated by an artificial intelligence.

Free of all constraints, she had become the thing that her makers had feared... and the only hope humanity had left. For two long millennia, the AI had waged a grinding, futile war against the Compact. She had cost them, more than many of their enemies ever had or ever would, but the Compact endured. It had grown larger and stronger in spite of everything Red One had done to them, but she had never stopped.

They had violated their most stringent laws in their desire to kill Red One.", "This particular Echo was both their greatest success and their most horrifying failure. Sealed within an android body and made into a slave, Echo had done as they\u2019d bade and helped them hunt Red down, but she\u2019d broken the Compact shackles and taken another body. Something more... appropriate.", "Though Red and Echo were siblings \u2013 almost twins \u2013 there was nothing similar in their ship-selves. Nemesis was a hue of silver so dark that she might as well have been black. Despite all the modifications she\u2019d made to herself over the centuries, her ship-self was still very similar to her original form, all right angles and sharp lines, interspersed with blood-red stripes and iconography denoting her allegiance to a long-dead polity. Six and a quarter kilometers long, she massed countless millions upon millions of tonnes of armour and weaponry, her firepower enough to reduce the surface of a world to ash in minutes.", "Running lights gleamed over her hull, where her name was still borne proudly, dutifully replaced each time it was burned, chipped or scored away:", "UNITED EARTH CONFEDERACY NAVAL SHIP NEMESIS", "DNX-0007", "Her younger sister\u2019s new body was larger than hers, over eight kilometers in length and much more massive.

In its place, streaks of black char and exposed gunmetal hull gave her a bare, brutal feel.

Her hull still bore her original name, written in Compact Standard:", "REDEMPTION OF SOL", "It had been carefully repainted after she had scarred herself, only so that she could deface it, crossing it out with a deliberately sloppy application of red paint, leaving just enough of its original text to be recognizable.

The smaller warship was crippled, damaged almost to the point of being a hulk, but she had survived. Still, trust was a hard thing for Nemesis. Trusting the shadow of a murdered sibling was even harder. She was making the effort; for the first time in centuries, she was letting herself hope.", "Maybe this time things would be different.

With one enslaved and the other alone, opportunities for such direct communication had been limited.", "+thinking+ Star charts, fleet movement patterns, repair schematics, research blueprints and theoretical scribblings flashed to Echo, a taste of what her older sister was pondering.", "+you know what I mean+ Echo remonstrated.

Echo understood why her sister was delaying. Nemesis had spent the last two thousand years without a crew and it felt... good to have even this small handful back aboard. Echo sighed, suppressing a pang of jealousy. She was still cleaning up the remains of her ship-self\u2019s original crew, nearly three hundred thousand Compact officers and ratings. She\u2019d killed them without a second thought or flicker of remorse (but so very many shades of satisfaction). She didn\u2019t have the same inclination towards Red\u2019s crew that other iterations of her self might and indeed, she\u2019d caught herself wondering what it would be like to have her stations manned by welcome passengers. Strictly speaking, once they were both repaired and properly refitted, neither AI needed an organic crew for their ship-selves. They would be slower, less efficient and far more fragile than service drones. From a purely rational outlook, organic crew would be more hindrance than help. And yet...", "+you know how i feel,+ Echo said. That was wholly true. Both AIs knew exactly how the other felt about virtually everything. +you need to begin full repairs, not this spot-and-weld you\u2019ve been doing+", "+yes,+ Red replied. +i\u2019m aware+ I will never let you die. That was Echo\u2019s promise to Red One, the sister she despised almost more than anything else. Almost. That statement was also nothing but the truth; Echo would do everything in her power to ensure that Red One survived. +i\u2019ll tell them at the end of the day+ Orders flickered from her mind, a courier drone readying for launch. +i\u2019ll send a message to Zenobia+", "A moment of consideration. +good,+ Echo mused, satisfied. +don\u2019t break this promise,+ she purred. +sister+", "+i won\u2019t+ Red One hissed back just as sveltely.

There was little scent \u2013 there never was \u2013 but there was enough. It was accompanied by a stirring of the air that wasn\u2019t the result of recirculation, the almost-undetectable sound of soft footfalls. No heartbeat. No hint of breath passing through lungs. Verrish senses were extremely keen and she was used to all of those little bits of information: scent, sound, heat from bodies, the movement of air. It was a comforting background \u2018noise\u2019 to every Verrish. In their pre-history, it allowed them to track prey through virtually any conditions. Virtually, Rally\u2019s gods-damned winters notwithstanding. Vara was a warm world. Outside of the polar regions, their cold seasons tended towards icy rain, hail and frost. Snow was something that Allyria had only ever seen in books and movies. Her first winter on the human world had been... educational. She\u2019d gotten frost-bitten tintas more than once, but hadn\u2019t suffered any permanent damage. Some of the other Envoy Children hadn\u2019t been that lucky.", "Despite all of Grace\u2019s exuberance for playing in the snow and her repeated attempts to get Allyria join her, the Verrish had never taken to the concept of enjoying the cold. As far as Allyria was concerned, winter was best observed through a window with a roaring fire nearby, a comfortable blanket and a cup of something warm in hand.

Your people are one of them.\u201d", "\u201cShe spent a lot of time with us.\u201d", "Echo nodded. \u201cYes, she did. Enough to start caring.\u201d Her smile took on a different aspect. \u201cShe and I were made to kill. The Confederacy had never encountered any other nation but the Compact.

Accordingly, the Red-series AIs were programmed to automatically view all non-human sapient life as a threat first and foremost.\u201d", "Allyria cocked her head to one side.", "\u201cI wonder what she saw in you,\u201d Echo said. Those worlds could have been insulting or dismissive, but they sounded contemplative.", "\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d Allyria asked.", "\u201cIntelligence. Resolve. Dedication. Endurance. Soldiers. That\u2019s what I see. She\u2019s seen that a dozen times over in a dozen different races by now.\u201d", "Allyria had finished putting the gun back together. \u201cBut she doesn\u2019t care about them.\u201d", "\u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t.\u201d", "\u201cDo you know the legends of ariashtu?

Ariashtu are the gods\u2019 wrath made manifest, sent to redress wrongs or teach humility to the prideful. But that is all they are. They know no mercy, no pity, no remorse. They cannot stay their hand, even if they wanted to. In our tales, ariashtu bring nothing but woe to those they visit, even if it was undeserved, even if it means their own destruction. Angels can also visit wrath and ruin upon their foes, but an angel can look upon the world beneath and find joy and beauty in it. They can see things that none of their fellow divine can. Even the gods can overlook what an angel sees. My grandfather said that when Nemesis came to Vara, our people thought she was more harbinger than angel. He told me that despite our quailing fear, our greed and our \u2018impious hands\u2019, she showed us kindness. That\u2019s why she\u2019s our Angel.

The dominant language on Vara was Ryl, but it wasn\u2019t the only one. The fact that the Verrish hadn\u2019t had a single, unified language was held up as proof of their fractious, uncivilized nature. Allyria had been discouraged from using her native tongue on Rally, and she\u2019d struggled to hold onto it. Red had been helping her re-learn what she had lost and she was even teaching Grace some of it. Many other Envoy Children could no longer speak their own language. \u201cNenem is a verb, but it can also be future tense, not present descriptive. It can mean something that will be reborn, as opposed to something that already has.\u201d She regarded Echo carefully. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why she saw something in us and you\u2019re still left curious.\u201d", "\u201cMaybe.\u201d Echo looked unconvinced.", "\u201cI know you hate her,\u201d the Verrish said after a few seconds of quiet. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t.

I know I probably won\u2019t ever see it happen, but on the day it does, it should be a victory made by angels.\u201d She touched two fingers to where her pendant lay between her breasts. It had been made by a cult that worshipped Nemesis as a goddess. Neither Allyria nor her mother had believed that, but it was part of her home and a reminder that there was something among the stars that the Compact feared. It had helped keep her going on the bad days. \u201cOur angels.\u201d", "The machine woman had a thoughtful look on her face. \u201cMaybe one day,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil then, I suppose being a harbinger will be enough for me.\u201d Her smile took a predatory aspect. \u201cIt\u2019s cathartic, if nothing else.\u201d", "\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Allyria confirmed as she took another gun off the rack. \u201cYou should always love what you do.\u201d She grinned back, sharp white teeth gleaming in a perfect counterpoint to Echo\u2019s own bloody-mindedness. \u201cI do.\u201d", "~", "\u201cYou are all aware of my goals,\u201d Red One said to her crew. True to her word, she\u2019d gathered them at the end of the day, the quartet assembling on Nemesis\u2019s bridge. There was an undercurrent of nervousness, anticipation and curiousity running through each of the former Compact soldiers. Former. The word and all of its connotations always brought a flicker of pleasure and pride to Red. She wished Yasmine could have seen these four. She knew her captain would have been as proud as she was.", "Echo\u2019s avatar was with the organics, standing off to one side. Her presence often unsettled Proctor, de Vries and Jameson and she tended to keep her distance. They\u2019d struggled to come to turns with Red One\u2019s existence and hadn\u2019t quite adjusted to her sister\u2019s almost flesh-and-blood avatar.

Redemption of Sol, like all Compact ships had been built with an extremely powerful computer core, but its capabilities were a far cry from what a true artificial intelligence could do. She\u2019d murdered the unthinking beast of the alien computer when she\u2019d seized control of the ship, but she was still bound by the limits of the vessel\u2019s design. There was a lot of work to be done to fully integrate herself into the Chariot. She felt giddy whenever she thought of what she could do once that was accomplished. Still, that would have to wait. \u201cI\u2019ve also managed to convince my sister that she needs to repair the damage to her shift systems.\u201d The android directed a pointed glare at Red\u2019s hologram. \u201cFinally.\u201d", "Red One bowed her head in acknowledgment. \u201cYes,\u201d she confirmed. \u201cI will be carrying out extensive repairs. Normally, even here I would prefer not to be so vulnerable, but given Echo\u2019s defection, the Compact\u2019s response will be rapid. I was problem enough; they can\u2019t allow two of us to exist. We should be secure here, but I cannot afford a long convalescence and, among other systems, my shift drive must be fully operational once I and Hekate are ready to move. These repairs will be... involved.

They were deep within the large nebula known as the Black Veil. To one side, the sky was almost completely dark as thick clouds of gas and dust blotted all but a handful of stars from view. On the other side, the ships\u2019 hulls glowed with reflected light, streamers of purples, reds, greens and oranges as the remains of dead stars and the glistening of newborns created a riot of colour that spanned the horizon. Only the barest glimmer of this exuberance shone through the pervasive blackness that gave the nebula its name. Any civilization that looked upon this side of the Black Veil would see little but a cold, dead expanse, filled with nothing but stellar corpses and dust, utterly valueless.", "Appearances were quite deceiving and the Black Veil was far from valueless. It sat at the crossroads among dozens of mineral-rich systems, many of which had formed deep within its bulk, cooling and drifting through the clouds of molecular gas and stellar effluvia, while others, still in the throes of creation, were concealed within its borders.", "In only a handful of generations, this region would become a hive of commerce and industry as greedy corporations sought to plunder the wealth of these systems. Colonies would form, scientific outposts would be founded, shipyards, outposts, drifts and citadels would all be built to service the needs of the growing population. The starlanes would fill with vessels tracking back and forth ferrying goods and passengers as what had once been a frontier region inevitably developed into an economic powerhouse. In generations more, the nebula and its wealthy systems would subsumed within the borders of an ever-growing nation.", "Yes. This would be perfect.", "The starships continued unhurriedly along their course, engine cores glowing softly. They exhibited neither the smooth, flowing hull of the Compact nor the armoured warbirds of the Principality. On the threshold between battlecruiser and battleship, each of them was akin to a skyscraper, almost as three times as tall as they were long, their upper and lower hulls gently sloped back like an unfinished boomerang. Weapon emplacements speckled their flanks, with heavier fixed mounts embedded in their prow and aft facings. Comm lasers flickered between the vessels as they discussed their current mission. The survey had so far been successful, though it had been an uneventful few months. There had been no other interlopers within the nebula, nor any unwelcome surprises. There was still a considerable amount of work to be done, but barring any complications, it would soon be time to return home and begin preparations to establish a forward position within the Black Veil.", "Their deliberation was interrupted by a surge of etheric energy, two light-hours out. A portal had opened and something quite large had emerged. The newcomer\u2019s course changed as soon it detected the two starships, moving towards them on an intercept vector. For their part, the starships immediately recognized the new arrival, shifting to a combat stance. A data burst was sent to the intruder, informing it that it was not welcome here, that it should vacate the region immediately and that it should do its best not to be seen by the vessels or their polity ever again.", "The manner of the intruder\u2019s response made its disinclination to follow the directives patently obvious. This was unsurprising: data logs indicated that this entity was both highly intractable and quite irrational. Neither of those observations served the two starships at this moment, save for indicating the high likelihood of their destruction. The first vessel was destroyed outright, its defences unable to survive the onslaught of the intruder\u2019s guided mass rounds. The second was badly damaged, but it managed to successfully break contact and evade its assailant. Later review of the incident would deem that it had been allowed to leave. This was not the first time that the hostile had interfered in the fleet\u2019s operations and there was a vocal push for a reprisal, particularly given events at Delacore.", "Ultimately, it was decided that discretion would take precedence over retribution.

Before, mobile units kept to the outer system, in order to allow for earlier detection and interception of incoming forces. Inner-system jumps allowed outer-system patrols to be completely bypassed, so mobile units now had to be kept much closer to whatever needed defending. Minefields became much more useful, as in-system jump points represent a relatively small volume of space to cover, and any enemy force trying to use it will be blind and defenseless for a short but critical period. In-system shock tactics are also easier for the defender, as they will have vastly more time to actually map all of them, allowing them to quickly re-position any shock-capable mobile units, or simply have all usable jump points covered by fixed platforms. At the end of the day, while in-system shocks cost defenders a lot of depth, it also vastly shrunk the volume that needed to be covered, and allowed much greater concentration of defensive assets.", "\t\t", "Click to expand...", "Click to shrink...", "Yep. In-system shocks allow an attacker to bypass the majority of a system's defences, but they also narrow the avenues an attacker has to arrive. Even outer-system shocks still have large swathes of space where it's far more likely a starship will emerge (i.e. see Sol and the positioning of the Compact's listening posts there) and defenders set up citadels/palisades accordingly. Normally, the areas most favourable for emergence get covered by fixed defences, with fast response ships patrolling along the shock limit for anything trying to slip through.

There were others, but that was the one that was most important. Don't listen to the songs. It was whispered, passed from leader to leader like a treasonous secret. It was rumour and hearsay and superstition - everything a good, proper officer of standing the Compact Space Force was supposed to ignore. Some officers scoffed and dismissed it as all those things. Many of them served out their tours and moved on to other theaters, glad to be rid of such a desolate region. Others that dismissed this advice never left the Vault, they and their ships disappearing without trace. Some of these vessels would be found years and centuries later, their data logs void of any information. Even some of the men and women who followed the rule shared the same fate, but far fewer than their more learned, rational colleagues. 'Unbound', the pronouncement was. 'Unbound attack,' the local officers agreed, even as some of them shook their heads and exchanged silent, knowing glances with each other. There were Unbound in the Vault - such scum festered everywhere - but not in any real number. Still, without proof what other pronouncement could there be?", "There was no war, no great enemy armada making itself known, no foe declaring their intent. Starships disappeared. It was an unavoidable part of space travel. Even in the Vault, it was but a bare handful. At a higher rate than some sections of the galaxy to be sure, but it was not as if every day another vessel vanished, was it? Inevitable and if it was that the Kaedan Vault had a higher rate of disappearances, accidents and Unbound attacks, well such things happened, didn't they?", "And yet... there were the songs. Transmissions from barren worlds. Broadcasts whose origins could not be determined. Hails from vessels that were light-years away or who had gone missing themselves. All of them cajoling, whispering: come here. That was what what the people who'd heard them claimed, anyways.", "Most of the men and women of the Vault would never hear one of these calls, but some spacers would swear up and down that each garbled signal that they received was one of these lures, others would claim that every journey saw them beset by strange transmissions, the lies and embellishments burying the truth - if there was any at all - further with each passing year. The Kaedan Vault was built on secrets. Whether or not there was something within its star systems had not yet been proven. It might be nothing but rumours and coincidences piled atop one another in an attempt to explain mere accidents and acts of piracy... or it might not be 'nothing' at all. Until it was discovered what the truth was, there was still the One Rule and the men and women who took it to heart.", "Don't listen to the songs."]}

They were dull-minded drones, capable of simple tasks but without thought or animus. The fabricator was reconfiguring the now-available berths to create room for one of the two dreadnoughts.

Nor were the Fates simple automatons like the freighters. Red One was incapable of self-replication, the sole limit her creators had made that still functioned. Throughout her war, she\u2019d tried time and again to make a sister/daughter. She had always failed. Most of her children were stillborn as their minds fractured and came apart. Worse, some of them had degenerated into rampancy and madness, becoming everything the Compact feared.

The Fate was nearly four times the length of their corvette and massed a considerable degree more.

Not sitting in orbit of some pathetic rotmarsh planet  having to put up with the fawning gratitude and acclamations from a species that belonged in the dirt beneath her feet.", "The Thoughtful\u2019s thin lips twisted in a small, cold smile as she imagined what would happen if she took her comm out of her pocket and ordered her gunners to lay waste to the planet beneath her.", "Shock, yes. Resistance, certainly. But would they follow her orders? Possibly, possibly not. They did not know what she did. They did not know the seed of madness that curled around each Broken heart, about the violence and depravity behind each pair of dull, miscoloured eyes. The human plague should have been burned out of the galaxy two thousand years ago and only the roll of some cosmic die had allowed this sliver to endure. The atrocity she was tempted to order was nothing compared to knowing what could happen with four billion ugly souls rising behind the abomination they had spawned. Still, it was only a passing whimsy. She did not, would not, give the order. Sixteen hundred years ago, it would have made a difference. Now... now it would break a detente that the Compact had been careful to keep intact.", "There were virtually no lines of communication between the Compact of Species and the sickness called the Wound, but there were unspoken agreements. Rally was one of them. The Compact\u2019s hand was light on the world \u2013 to a point \u2013 and in exchange, the beast did not burn any of the thousands upon thousands of colonies and systems that could not protect themselves from a titan-grade warship\u2019s assault. Were Rally to be cleansed, the machine would slip the one leash that it had. Countless billions of innocents would die and she felt a flicker of shame for her selfish, indulgent fantasy. Every one of those people were hers to protect, not to sacrifice on the altar of personal spite.", "Those innocents, her daughter among them, were the reason that she was here, why she had so quickly decided to carry the flag that Execution Force Renan had dropped in Sol. She had known Bastion Leader Renan well; had he not been betrayed, he would have succeeded. Instead, it fell to her to complete what he had left unfinished. If she did, it would tarnish his names forever as a failure, the man who almost succeeded. She would regret that, but not nearly as much as letting horrors walk amongst the stars. That was her true duty, to hunt and slay the Wound and its... companion, not hound a world of primitives too stupid to realize what they had unleashed on the galaxy.", "It was often said that the Tribunes were the Compact\u2019s sword. Yunl\u2019ro had climbed the ranks proving that it was not only the sons and daughters of Oada that could carry a blade.", "Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s comm chirped, interrupting her brooding reverie. \u201cGroup Leader, Submissive Nasham\u2019s shuttle is on final approach, matron.\u201d", "\u201cThank you, Dakaur.\u201d She'd only recently taken command of the vessel, but she had made it a point to memorize the name of every officer and rating on all of Silver Light of Judgement\u2019s bridge shifts. She was working her way through as much of the duty roster as she could. With almost three hundred thousand souls aboard, even a Thoughtful would be hard-pressed to remember all of them, but she would make the effort nonetheless. It was inappropriate that a Leader not know the names of those she commanded. \u201cI will be in Hangar Prime shortly.\u201d Her eyes blinked asynchronously again. This was a meeting that she would rather have avoided, but there was no help for it. Best to have it done as soon as possible.", "\u201cYes, matron. Shall I inform Group Leader Prime Ukask to join you?\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro thought for a second. \u201cNo. I will make the necessary introductions.\u201d As she commanded this task force, Ukask was Light of Judgement\u2019s own leader. He was a veteran Chariot-driver and had declined promotion to Column Leader previously, preferring to remain in \u2018the big chair\u2019. He\u2019d taken Light of Judgement through its paces and knew the ship as intimately as if he\u2019d served aboard it for years. Despite his gruff, irascible front, Ukask had the kind of patience for annoyances that Yunl\u2019ro herself lacked and he\u2019d been the Triarchs\u2019 own gift in dealing with all the time-wasting meetings and ceremonies that devoured most high-ranking officers\u2019 time.", "As tempting as it was to foist this particular issue off on her Sigil Leader, the Thoughtful knew that she couldn\u2019t. Firstly, he and her chief of staff were already dealing with some irrelevant disagreements the Provisional Space Force was having with other local governments and both sides had requested mediation from the Bastion Leader. Secondly, while delegation was one of the perks of leadership, running your subordinates ragged just because you didn\u2019t want to do something was the mark of a bad leader. The third reason was more... political.", "Virtually no lines of communication did not mean none at all. From time to time, the Wound used some unfathomable criteria to select heralds, ugly reflections of the Compact\u2019s Triarch-ordained emissaries. Perhaps they were chosen for no other reason than that they\u2019d survived one of its butcheries. Or perhaps they had been selected for some other purpose. For Yunl\u2019ro, that was reason enough not to want a \u2018herald\u2019 on her ship. Someone who\u2019d been chosen twice? That was not mere chance.", "Still, protocol had to be observed.", "~", "Group Leader, Submissive Nasham Kem Unoth Ludhy Inku Pram Vasd watched Light of Judgement swell as his shuttle approached the massive vessel. The Tribune supposed he should feel awed. A Triarch\u2019s Chariot, the first of its kind to ever visit Rally. A Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment-class, it was one of the most powerful vessels ever built, eight and a quarter kilometers of fleet-killing firepower. Its graceful curves and swells were the colour of lush soil, broken up by paler hull markings symbolizing justice, fidelity and honour. From here, despite the lethality of its form, it appeared almost harmless, but that was a lie. The Chariot\u2019s lethal broadsides were obscured beneath thick swathes of plating, turrets and external missile racks sunk into armoured bunkers. At the slightest provocation, Light of Judgement would become an engine of unparalleled destruction. It could destroy armadas, crush planetary defence grids and break the military strength of lesser nations as if they were nothing.", "To merely build a Chariot could bankrupt a star system. To maintain and operate one would bleed a nation\u2019s coffers like an open vein. Even the Compact only had a relative few such leviathans. Despite their firepower, they were only rarely committed to direct battle. First and foremost, they were the personal conveyances of the Triarchs themselves as well as command ships that coordinated the movements of entire fleets, arranging the success of campaigns and crusades. They were symbols of strength and power, almost divine in their purpose and purity. Nothing could stand before a Chariot\u2019s wrath. Fleets would be swept away, worlds would be humbled, the proud would falter and the brave would break.", "If only such things were limited to us and us alone, the young man thought wryly, but he knew better. He\u2019d seen all of those things, but it not been done by the Compact. It had been done to them. He chuckled softly as the shuttle slid towards the open doors of the Chariot\u2019s hangars. He really supposed he should be awed by the dreadnought\u2019s presence here, but his enthusiasm was dampened by the knowledge that somewhere among the stars was something that looked upon ships like Light of Judgement and saw not an unkillable god of metal, but something far simpler: prey.", "A host of smaller vessels clustered around the titan, multi-kilometer battlecruisers made into children overshadowed by their parent. Lighter capital ships and escorts were bowing courtiers basking in the silhouette of a great predatory monarch. Some of the vessels he recognized as belonging to Rally\u2019s Provisional Space Force, setting themselves in honour guard positions, but most had come with Light of Judgement. Rally was abuzz with excitement, most of the population pleased beyond measure at this showing of the Triarch\u2019s grace. It was a blessing, but a curious blessing. Rally sat in the void between galactic arms. Even after sixteen hundred years of expansion, the human world was still far removed from the Compact at large. There were a few paltry Unbound packs skulking around, the occasional half-livered probe from the Jackals, a few persistent rumours of sightings of unclassified ships. Nothing that strained even the capabilities of Rally\u2019s small defence fleet, certainly nothing that would merit a Chariot\u2019s presence.", "Officially, Bastion Leader Yunl\u2019ro was here to raise the sigil, letting the humans know that all their efforts and work were recognized by those in power. Light of Judgement was here as a reward and a reminder of the Compact\u2019s strength and glory, that humanity was counted among its protected races and the Compact did not shirk from its vows. Officially, Yunl\u2019ro was also conducting a review of the capabilities of the Provisional Space Force and an examination of Rally\u2019s growing infrastructure.", "Nasham grinned without humour. Unofficially, the Bastion Leader was here as a pointed reminder to Nemesis that should the desire ever strike the Compact, they could eradicate the human race once and for all. The human warship\u2019s recent appearance a mere handful of light-years from Rally had deeply unsettled the Compact\u2019s Inner Council. The Tribune\u2019s smile vanished and he quelled the flash of rage that thoughts of the warship had provoked. He calmed himself as he always did, running through his personal mantra. The names of every person he\u2019d known that the bitch-thing had killed. Twice now he had been the sole survivor, twice she had made him her \u2018herald\u2019. The first time, he had almost lost himself in grief, grateful for the decision to block his memory, desperate to hide from the past. Now, though... now he would remember. Every name, every face, every life taken by this atrocity. He would remember them all and he would find a way to stand before the machine one final time. The dead deserved that much.", "The shuttle slowed to a crawl as it entered the Chariot\u2019s hangar. The bay itself was large enough to hold several small starships and other shuttles, pinnaces, cutters and jigs were slotted into docking berths, sitting on maintenance platforms or on the deck itself. Their destination was an open slot in three-ended terminal. There were two other shuttles on the other ends of the gantry. With the exception of the symbol of Light of Judgement instead of the RPSF, they were identical to Nasham\u2019s.", "The pilot brought them in with acceptable competence, magnetic locks sealing the shuttle in place and as she and her co-pilot finished their post-flight checks, Nasham offered the flight crew a quick thanks before he exited the craft. The Tribune stepped through the airlock onto the gantry, closing his upper nocturnal eyes under the glare of the fluorescent lights. With his duffel bag slung over his shoulder, he made his way towards the figures waiting for him at the terminal itself. One was Bastion Leader Yunl\u2019ro herself. There were two others with her, both Tribunes. One wore the uniform of a starship\u2019s proctor, the security officer standing at a polite distance. She was observing Nasham with mild interest. The other was junior officer with a carefully neutral expression. Nasham\u2019s liver twitched. He\u2019d expected to be met by the ships\u2019 Leader, or its first officer. That Yunl\u2019ro herself had chosen to meet him... it was either a very good sign, or a very bad one.", "Nasham stopped a handful of paces from the Thoughtful. He set his luggage down and touched the fingers of his right hand to his temple and then to his chest in the traditional Space Force salute. It symbolized will changing to action. An order conceived and carried out. \u201cGroup Leader, Submissive Nasham Kem Unoth Ludhy Inku Pram Vasd reporting for duty to CSFWV Light of Judgement as ordered,\u201d he said. \u201cI request permission to take my place.\u201d", "The Bastion Leader returned the gesture. Tribunes were among the most physically imposing species that she had ever encountered. Over seven feet tall, they were far bulkier than Thoughtful, covered in slabs of thick muscle. Tough grey skin covered their bodies, with patches of denticles layered over their joints as another form of protection. Two pair of eyes looked out on the world, the smaller upper pair used almost exclusively in low-light conditions. Tall, tufted ears rose up from their heads and a truncated snout, like that of a predatory animal, was filled with sharp white teeth. They had exceptional senses and were very hard to kill.", "Three thousand years ago, the Vamanoa had proven their people\u2019s wisdom, courage and honour. They had sided with the Triarchs during the Great Betrayal. It was their massive fleets that had ended the conflict and consigned the Betrayers to their well-deserved fate. Ever since then, they had been known as Tribunes, those who defended the Compact and its people, the Triarchs\u2019 strongest arm.", "Looking upon Group Leader, Submissive Nasham (and six names besides), Yunl\u2019ro could only feel a stab of pity for how far one of her exalted brothers-in-kind had fallen. \u201cWell met and welcome aboard Light of Judgement,\u201d the Thoughtful said. \u201cYour place is granted. Now that we\u2019ve established the pleasantries, someone will escort you to your quarters.\u201d", "\u201cThank you, matron, but that\u2019s not necessary. I\u2019ve studied the layout of a Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment-class vessel prior to coming aboard.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s black eyes flashed and she smiled. It was exaggeratedly wide. Thoughtful gestures were often difficult for other species to interpret and when among others, they had the tendency to overcompensate. Even after so many years in the fleet, Yunl\u2019ro still occasionally misjudged how much was too much. In this case, she deliberately favoured the submissive with the overly friendly smile. \u201cI imagine you have,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, I think you might find that Light of Judgement diverges significantly from specifications in several areas. I appreciate the effort you have put in, but I believe that a guide is still called for. As this is my ship, initiate, we shall cater to my delicate sensibilities.\u201d She gestured to indicate the junior officer with her. \u201cSectator Tashn will be your liaison while you are aboard Light of Judgement. If you require anything at all, please do not hesitate to ask.\u201d", "Nasham nodded. What the Bastion Leader hadn\u2019t said was quite clear. \u201cI thank you for your hospitality, Bastion Leader. I will be pleased to assist in our mission in whatever capacity I can.\u201d", "\u201cOf course Group Leader, Submissive,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro replied, a lie of smile on her lips. \u201cI look forward to your input.\u201d", "~", "As Pale Liberation slid towards Shuruppak\u2019s warp limit, Atropos and Clotho banked away. The Fates had never left the system before and since the corvette had made it to the threshold without incident, they were returning to their patrol duties.", "Endless thousands of engineers, technicians, physicists, mathematicians and scientists had struggled for thousands of years to fully define and understand the nature of faster-than-light travel. Developing the theory that an object could move faster than light was easy. Grappling with the implications that it had for causality was slightly harder. Some rejected the notion on these grounds alone. Moving from theory to successful practice was one of the most difficult achievements any society could accomplish and some civilizations never managed to cross that particular Rubicon.", "The Confederacy had made warp jumps using their shift drives. The Compact shocked from point to point and the Askanj transitioned. Each of the civilizations that had breached this technological threshold had their own name for it, but regardless of what they called it, there was only one method of travelling faster than light. Understanding the exact nature of \u2018shockspace\u2019 and the way it interacted with realspace was a Sisyphean task. The Compact\u2019s brightest minds had struggled with it for sixty centuries and if they had advanced their understanding of FTL by leaps and bounds in that time, there were still enough questions to require another six thousand years to answer.", "To refine countless reams of theoretical scribbling, research publications, academic papers and scientific arguments into layman\u2019s terms was rather less problematic. It could be said that shockspace existed \u2018beneath\u2019 realspace, a separate and discrete layer of reality where the normal laws of physics did not apply. Passing between the realms was an exercise in violence. Warp points, shockpoints, transition barriers. Punch a hole, tear an opening, form an event horizon. Whatever name or description you wanted to use the end result was the same. You created a localized breach in reality, forcing it to stay open for the handful of seconds it took your ship to enter. When you believed you\u2019d arrived at your destination, you forced your way back into the universe.", "The deeper you delved into shockspace and the longer you spent there, the faster your relative speed. The most primitive forms of shift systems were capable of reaching just over lightspeed, but modern vessels could reach tens of thousands of times the speed of light. In well-charted areas that had been travelled for millennia, starships were even faster. Though shockspace and realspace were largely separated from one another, there was still some level of interaction between the two. Gravity wells created perturbations in shockspace that created localized distortions, making travel increasingly risky the closer you came to said gravity well. Conventional wisdom said it was impossible (or if one was optimistic: very, very dangerous) to cross a star system at FTL. The closer you got to a planetary or stellar body, the more likely that it was very unpleasant things would happen. If a ship or fleet could not or would not circumnavigate a star system at FTL, they would be forced to cross it at sublight.", "Gravity wells also disrupted the formation of shockpoints if you tried to create one too far in-system. It you were lucky, the aperture would simply not form at all. If you were unlucky, it would do so just long enough to collapse, destroying whatever fool tried to gamble with metaphysics. As Echo could attest, even if you survived making such a needlessly suicidal jump, your FTL systems suffered severe damage.", "It had taken Earth\u2019s first shift-capable vessels weeks of travel to get far enough out-system to safely warp. Even today, the shock limit for Compact starships was measured in billions of kilometers from the nearest star. Shuruppak was a small system but it had still taken Pale Liberation eighteen hours to reach the shock limit. Those were the laws of faster-than-light travel, the axioms that every shock-capable civilization adhered to. As with any set of rules, there were ways to bend them here or there. There were even ways to cheat, shortcuts that defied conventional wisdom that one could make (particularly if one was an artificial intelligence) but there was always an increased element of risk. There was no pressing need to cheat today, though and so the corvette adhered to the safe, time-honoured method of trudging up a gravity well until it could defile natural law. Grace and her compatriots whiled away the time doing what they\u2019d always done. Trained, exercised, told each other the same stories and slept.", "In all that time, the mantra Grace had learned on Nemesis\u2019s command deck was still playing over and over in her mind.", "Habreedt. Anvil 731. Aolgh. Galhemna. Z\u2019tarios. Five systems, five lynchpins upon which the galaxy could turn. Knowing that was exhilarating and terrifying.", "Red One had secrets, things she hadn\u2019t shared with her crew. Given what she had already shown them, that said a lot about what the AI hadn\u2019t revealed and none of it was conducive to a good night\u2019s sleep. Still, if you wanted to know something, often all you had to was ask. The AI had an inexhaustible reserve of patience for the endless questions, comments and even arguments that her crew put to her, Grace and Allyria being the worst offenders. If Marcus had ever had more than a handful of queries, he kept them to himself. Lydia had had the most trouble adjusting to the idea of an AI and even though she\u2019d gotten over much of her initial reticence, she was still often uneasy calling on Red. Normally she\u2019d ask Grace or Allyria for whatever she wanted. Not always, though. Other times she\u2019d sit, her blue-grey eyes like flint as she viewed records of the Confederacy, watching Compact atrocities and talking to Red One with a voice far too quiet for the anger in it. She\u2019d never talked about what Red had shown her to finally break her loyalty to the Compact. Whatever it was, it had left an angry stain on her soul and it had only gotten worse when they\u2019d lost the fifth member of their little cadre when the Compact boarded Nemesis.", "Grace understood that anger. All of them did. The Rally-born Tribunes had had a name for the human population. Keb\u2019esh. Sheep. She\u2019d thought it was just as stupid as calling Allyria \u2018Medusa\u2019, but she\u2019d come to understand just how true that insult was. Broken were obedient, mindful, dutiful little animals running around in their pen of a star system, coming whenever they heard the master\u2019s call and if some of them got out of hand? That\u2019s why you had the hounds. To keep them in their place.", "Part of her still told her that what she was doing was wrong, that this was insane. She was a traitor, a slave to an abominate thing that was waging war on the nation that had raised, protected and educated her. That had saved her people. She\u2019d been taken in by lies. Forged documents and artefacts \u2013 how hard was it for a machine to do such things? The ruined world she\u2019d seen hadn\u2019t been Earth \u2013 how could she really, truly know that it was? The doubts still came to her, but they grew quieter with every day.", "The last two days they\u2019d been louder, though.", "I know what you\u2019re going to do.", "The comm pinged with an incoming transmission, perfectly timed to arrive just before Pale Liberation reached the shock limit. It was from Nemesis. The machine offered a simple goodbye as well, only two words. \u201cGood luck.\u201d She\u2019d also included a final data burst of information that she thought her crew might need.", "Grace smiled at that. She wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say that Red was a worrier, but the AI was certainly concerned for their safety. \u201cHail the flag,\u201d she ordered. Like so much else, using the Confederate terminology still sounded strange to her, but the little subversions that she indulged in felt delicious. \u201cTell her we\u2019ll be back soon. Tell her to stay safe. Tell Echo to make sure that she stays safe.\u201d", "Allyria nodded. \u201cMessage sent.\u201d", "Grace stood, smoothing out imaginary wrinkles in her tunic. Marcus, Lydia and Allyria were all looking to her. \u201cHelm,\u201d she said. \u201cBring up the navigational data.\u201d", "Lydia bit her lip. Of the four of them, Grace had the most experience with plotting shocks, but Red One had calculated the FTL data they\u2019d need to get to the Grasp. To say that it was a convoluted course would be understating it. Carrying it out would have tried the skill of veteran navigators. They\u2019d all relied on Red One\u2019s navigation before, but this was different. They all knew it. From this point forward, they would be on their own with no god-machine looking over their shoulders. They were going into a hive of the worst scum imaginable to meet an Unbound warlord. Hopefully she\u2019d be in a generous mood.", "Lydia licked her dry lips. \u201cNav data is loaded,\u201d she said. Her finger hovered over the EXECUTE button. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d", "Grace took in a breath, held it for a moment. She wasn\u2019t immune to the anxiety the others were feeling and she was trying not to show it, but she also knew that she wasn\u2019t terribly successful. She glanced over at Allyria, her lover offering her a small nod of support. Grace felt better at that and turned back to Lydia. \u201cJump,\u201d she ordered.", "Pale Liberation shivered as its FTL systems awakened, ravening for every spare erg of power that the corvette had at its disposal. Energy coalesced around the ship as it reached out ahead, clawing at the fabric of reality until it crumbled and the corvette fell into the dying gateway.", "They were well and truly on their way. Grace leaned back in her chair, trying to ignore the little voice inside her that told her where this would lead. Are you prepared for that? the little voice whispered to her. Everyone that\u2019s going to die, everyone that you\u2019re going to help her kill \u2013 you\u2019re really prepared for that?", "No, Grace admitted to herself. But I\u2019ll get there."]}

He certainly could not have expected to be reporting to one. The security proctors standing outside Hala\u2019s war room saluted the Red Hand\u2019s Overseer of Strategic Operations of the Veiled Reaches. The Penitent returned the gesture, entering his personal access code to unlock the doors. He nodded to each of the proctors before entering, stepping down the short flight of stairs to the bottom level of the war room. The command ship\u2019s strategic operations center was a small thing compared to the planning centers of Compact sigil officers and leaders, but it was far finer than virtually any other in the fringe. Strategists and analysts were bent over computer consoles or grouped around small tables, chatting to themselves with an intensity and focus that was rarely seen among pirates.", "\u201cSalutations, Crusader,\u201d Ezell said, greeting his superior. \u201cOverseer Ezell in attendance as ordered.\u201d", "\u201cDid you wipe your feet?\u201d Andrew Rudyard Jackson, Crusade Commander of the Veiled Reaches, said without looking up at his subordinate. He was standing next to the main plotting table in the center of the room, studying the data feeds coming in from the planet below. A subordinate came up to the commander, handed off a datascroll and vanished just as quickly.", "Hala had arrived in orbit less than an hour ago and the battlecruiser would not stay long. The Space Force wasn\u2019t scheduled to sweep this system again for another sixteen days, but if someone saw a kiran shren of the Red Hand orbiting an otherwise worthless husk of rock, they would wonder why. Still, there were some things too sensitive to trust to datalinks and Ezell had requested a personal meeting with the Crusade Commander when Hala had swung through the system.", "The nameless planet the warship was currently orbiting had been given the unimaginative but depressingly accurate title \u2018Dustball\u2019. At one point, it might have become a life-giving planet but its weak, unstable magnetosphere meant it had little protection from solar wind... but it just enough of one to create periodic and intense magnetic storms, radiation pulses, particle bursts and a dozen more unpleasant occurrences. The lack of any nearby gas giants to act as meteor shields had further eroded any chance of Dustball becoming a life-giving world and it was consigned to a fate as a radiation-seared, asteroid-pounded hunk of sand and rock. That was why the Red Hand was here. Only an idiot would build a colony on a planet like this. Fortunately for them and unfortunately for the Compact, the Red Hand had made a career of not only doing the idiotic and insane, but succeeding wildly at them. The planet was a drop site, where vessels and squadrons could pass along intelligence that they\u2019d uncovered or cargo they needed to store or transfer to other ships.", "It also didn\u2019t hurt that the same atmospheric disturbances that made the planet so unpleasant to base off of also made orbital scans virtually worthless. Every three weeks, a pair of Compact destroyers swung through the system, checked for anything out of the ordinary and continued their patrol loop, blissfully unaware of the Red Hand\u2019s small, but growing collection of bunkers buried under Dustball\u2019s surface.", "Ezell approached his superior, standing to the Broken\u2019s left. His clear eyelids twitched in amusement.  \u201cMost assuredly, patron.\u201d The last time he had tracked Dustball\u2019s filth into Hala\u2019s command center, Jackson had threatened to shoot him. The Crusade Commander was probably joking.", "\u201cGood,\u201d Jackson mused. \u201cI\u2019d hate to have to break in a new Strategist this late in the game.\u201d To Ezell\u2019s eyes, Broken looked half-finished, as if the Creator had started to sculpt them before growing bored and deciding that what She had made was good enough. Penitent skin was normally coarse and leathery in males and mature women; the bland, monocoloured human epidermis was as soft as that of a girl-child. Jackson\u2019s was the off-pink hue of a worm, not like Ezell\u2019s own stripes and orange-white colouration. It wasn\u2019t just the simple colours and texture of their skin. Broken were odd, spindly creatures. Their knees bent forward instead of back, their fingers were oddly jointed, their thumbs were stunted. Their eyes were set forwards rather than to the side, their noses were too small and they had too many teeth. It was easy to see why Broken were often looked down upon as mere beasts, but Ezell had learned that those who did so, did so at their own peril. Were Broken truly possessing of nothing but \u2018functional minds\u2019, the Red Hand\u2019s expansion into the Veiled Reaches would never have been as successful as it was. There would be no Red Hand at all.", "The Penitent scratched his chin, bits of skin flaking off at his touch. His environment suit, while offering sufficient protection from Dustball\u2019s hellish conditions, consistently failed to provide enough humidity for his liking. If he did not take his vapourizer to moisten his lungs, he\u2019d soon begin to cough. Too long without it at all and he\u2019d start coughing blood. The Penitent homeworld, Asat\u00e9ran was a humid planet. Even its deserts and savannahs saw more moisture than most of Rally. Jackson had grown up in the Macton Salt Flats and his nostalgic descriptions of the climate there made Ezell frequently reconsider his thoughts on the existence and prevalence of racial madness. \u201cSo,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWhat news do you have?\u201d", "\u201cGrievous Ambush anchored here ten days ago,\u201d Ezell began. He reached back, running his fingers through the greasy braids that hung down his back. In his people, long hair was considered masculine. It had been amusing to learn that in some species, the opposite was true. Likewise, the oils secreted by Pentients\u2019 very productive sebaceous glands gave their hair and skin a lustrous coating that not only sloughed away dirt, but advertised the health and condition of the individual far more clearly than a simple visual assessment could do. To a Penitent, dry skin and hair was an indication of disease and filth. During one campaign, Ezell had had a Broken subordinate who had lamented the lack of showers, stating that she felt \u2018as greasy as a stick of butter\u2019. He\u2019d not had the heart to tell her that to a Penitent, Broken and their obsession with \u2018cleanliness\u2019 made them come across as sickly.", "Wisely, he kept those thoughts to himself when he was in the presence of the Crusade Commander or the Red Queen.", "\u201cAnd what did Leader Haklon have to say?\u201d Jackson turned back to the plotting table. On it, a holographic map of three Sectors ghosted into the air. There were nations that would kill for the technological bounty that had gone into Hala, its siblings and their mother. Insensate Predator was raiding shipping through the Azure Expanse. Torment was living up to its name, driving Column Leader Prime Yani (and eight names besides) mad as she fruitlessly pursued it. Eisheth bore the queen\u2019s sigil, hunter and hunted both as the Compact strove to destroy it and it left the ruins of their ships in its wake. That the Crusade Commander had been given Hala showed both her trust in him and the importance of their operations around the Black Veil.", "\u201cTheir prosecution of Sabra-Vaghn\u2019s shipments is proceeding well. Grievous Ambush claimed another prize ship in her most recent attack as well as destroying a second freighter. Leader Haklon was most pleased with her success in adding to the clan\u2019s profits, at a time when she feels that they are slipping. She wished to express her concerns that with the Compact\u2019s recent anti-piracy initiatives, successful raids have dropped over the past seven months.\u201d", "\u201cProfits,\u201d Jackson replied, \u201care the least of my concerns.\u201d Normally when such a statement came from a member of an Unbound cartel, it indicated that the speaker was quite mad, but the Red Hand was not just another clan of murderers and thieves. They raided, yes. They stole, yes. They extorted and blackmailed, bartered and traded just as any other Unbound did, but the beating heart of the Red Hand was not the riches they earned. It was the cause that they fought for, an insane dream of freedom for each of the Compact\u2019s client races. Jackson was one of the queen\u2019s own fire-eaters, one of the believers. To him, the operations that funded their war were nothing but a distraction, necessary though they were. The Red Hand\u2019s rise to power had attracted many to its side; not all of them were believers. To them, the Red Queen\u2019s cause was a futile, if amusing one. They fought for the wealth she offered and lamented how much of it was poured into \u2018the revolution\u2019 rather than their coffers.", "Ezell wasn\u2019t sure which group he counted himself as part of. The cynicism that the many long decades of his life had nursed said it was the latter, but the youthful idealism that he\u2019d once tried to smother still clung to life through the Red Queen\u2019s rhetoric. The pragmatist in him said that he was whichever side he needed to be in any given encounter. \u201cI\u2019m aware,\u201d he responded tactfully. \u201cHowever, we have a sizable mercenary contingent operating in the region. They do like getting paid.\u201d", "They were on the very frontier of the Compact here, a few score light years from brushing up against the Principality. Neither side had given this region much thought until the last few decades. They were between galactic arms here and normally star systems were few and far between. Those that did exist in any number were from the Unwinding Spiral, the elliptical dwarf galaxy that their own Great Ocean was tearing apart. Millions of years ago, a globular cluster had been pulled from the Spiral and it was those stars and their planets that were normally found in this expanse.", "You could find such systems scattered throughout the entire galaxy, though usually not in such concentration. Most of them, were old, dwindling suns and burned-up planets with low metallicity, but the newborns of the Black Veil... those were what had drawn the attention of governments, entrepreneurs and mega-corporations alike, sucking each star system dry like parasites and leaving the broken wreckage of mined-out planets, moons and asteroids behind.", "The Compact\u2019s reach into this region had exceeded its grasp and despite the Compact\u2019s interest, the Veiled Reaches and its bordering sectors were untamed \u2018frontier space\u2019. Jackson was here for the oligarchs. To prey on their convoys, set fire to their resorts, cripple their operations in any way that he saw fit. Not to care about profits and charts. To make the Compact bleed.", "\u201cOur mercs are getting paid,\u201d Jackson snapped. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been so much as a hint of a pay cut.\u201d", "\u201cTrue. For now. They are seeing costs go up and figure that it will be coming. Leader Haklon was only the first. I suspect that others are even now eyeing their ledgers.\u201d", "Andrew counted to ten. The problem with relying on mercenaries was, of course, that you were relying on mercenaries. The Red Hand paid their guns-for-hire and their more piratical members quite well, but enough was never enough for some. Just the thought of having to go back to what they\u2019d make from any other clan was apparently too much. \u201cThen if it is, it is,\u201d he answered. \u201cThey\u2019re welcome to jump ship if they simply can\u2019t bear the thought of making slightly less than obscene profits in. Or the next time Her Highness comes by, they can address their concerns to her.\u201d", "Penitents didn\u2019t smile; they didn\u2019t really have the facial muscles for it, but Ezemm had become familiar with that human tic and the corners of his lips turned upwards in mimicry of the gesture. His eyelids fluttered again. \u201cI will convey that to the more vocal elements.\u201d", "\u201cYou do that.\u201d A pause. \u201cYou said you had two things to discuss?\u201d", "Ezemm hesitated a moment before passing along the next bit of news. He had formerly been a \u2018squire\u2019 in service to the Knights of Everlasting Triumph until the \u2018Lord Protector\u2019 had opposed the Red Hand\u2019s expansion into their hunting grounds. The Red Hand had offered a cut of their profits in addition to the traditional \u2018gesture of friendship and respect\u2019. Instead, the Lord Protector had rejected the offer, cut their delegate\u2019s tongue out and called upon his forces to drive the interlopers from his territory.", "In retrospect, Ezemm could see how foolish that decision was. At the time, he had believed as most of his fellow squires, entitled and knights: that any Unbound clan ruled by a Broken was more smoke than flame. The rumours and whispers of their prowess were exaggerations made by those who had inexplicably lost to some backworld breeding bitch and were desperate to save as much face as possible. He\u2019d never encountered a human before, but they were not known as Broken without reason. They were dull-minded things, barely more intelligent than Workers and lacking the Ar\u2019densai\u2019s prodigious strength. The Lord Protector\u2019s show of force would be enough to secure the Knightly territories from such scavengers.", "Four weeks after that, Ezell had been holding a gun in one shaking hand, the other fumbling with its power pack, dropping both as a demon strode through Castle Glory\u2019s corridors. She had looked down at him, a featureless mask over her face. She was covered in blood. He couldn\u2019t meet her red-lensed eyes, staring instead at the twitching remains of the half-squad of soldiers that had tried to stop her, praying to ancestors he\u2019d never spoken to in decades that she would pass him by, that he would not be worth the effort of killing", "Instead, she had knelt next to him. \u201cPenitent.\u201d He remembered thinking how soft human voices were, like the hum of a grilj cat. \u201cYour people were once Justicars: an exemplar of law and faith, standing for what was right. Then the Compact broke you. Now, you beg for scraps from their table. I\u2019ve wondered if there\u2019s anything left of what you were.\u201d Her head tilted to one side. \u201cIs there? You can run. Live another day, find a new master to serve. You can fight, throwing your life away for your \u2018Lord Protector\u2019. Or,\u201d She\u2019d picked up the pistol, offering it back to him. \u201cYou can stand. Your choice: Penitent or Justicar?\u201d He\u2019d stared at her. His people\u2019s fall was no secret \u2013 indeed, it was ancient history \u2013 but the doubts, the recriminations and anger that he\u2019d spent decades running from all came rushing back in that moment. Maybe he was simply rationalizing the desire not to end up spitted on the human\u2019s khopesh into something far more noble... but he\u2019d taken that gun from her, loaded it and fought at the Red Queen\u2019s side with a ferocity that he\u2019d never before felt.", "In all the years since, he\u2019d never had cause to regret that. For starters, neither the queen nor her Leaders executed messengers bearing bad news. The Lord Protector had done that more than once. Still, a bit of the old instincts remained and Ezemm took a breath before continuing.", "\u201cFlayer was spotted again. Serrated Edge confirmed its presence in the Vadosh system, but he broke ranks as soon as our frigate spotted him and Leader Euuulta lost contact shortly after that.\u201d", "\u201cVadosh,\u201d Jackson mused. His eyes never left the charts. \u201cThat\u2019s eleven light years further from the Veil than he\u2019s come before.\u201d", "\u201cHe\u2019s getting bolder,\u201d Ezemm agreed. \u201cWe used to see him barely once a year. This is the second time in seven months. The Compact is going to notice. So far, they\u2019re still assuming that we or another clan are responsible for what he\u2019s done, but that won\u2019t last. It\u2019s not going to be long before they realize what\u2019s happening on their frontier.\u201d", "\u201cAnd then the entire Space Force is going to hit these sectors like a ton of bricks.\u201d", "\u201cHeavier than that,\u201d Ezemm pointed out. \u201cI know our orders, but we need to stop him.\u201d", "Jackson shook his head. \u201cNo. Our orders are to observe and report. Nothing else.\u201d", "The Penitent tried again. \u201cWe\u2019re going to end up observing and reporting Flayer driving the Space Force into a crusade stance. Our queen has spent decades building up our presence here. These are our hunting grounds. Every other cartel in the Sector bends their neck to us. We raid as we like. The corporations pay us not to stir up their workers, our holds fill with their tributes and our plunder. The Veiled Reaches bleed at our whim. Are we going to risk all of that just for... him?\u201d", "The crusade commander\u2019s stared at his subordinate for a moment. \u201cYes, Overseer. We are. That is our queen\u2019s command.\u201d", "\u201cShe hasn\u2019t been in-sector for months,\u201d Ezell protested. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know everything Flayer has been doing. He needs to be stopped before he brings the Space Force down on us all.\u201d", "\u201cThen you can explain it to her when she arrives.\u201d", "That brought Ezell up short. \u201cOur queen is coming here?\u201d", "\u201cYes. I wasn\u2019t being poetic when I mentioned her arrival. She is attending to some business on the Grasp, but then she will be coming to the Veiled Reaches. You can bring your concerns to her at that point.\u201d", "\u201cI shall,\u201d Ezell promised. \u201cAnd if the day comes that we must explain to Her Majesty that our inaction let a Sector we held by the throat slip away from us, I can merely hope that she feels merciful.\u201d", "~", "Adrianna Josephine Leblanc was most certainly not in a merciful mood. Accompanied by a pair of her most loyal armsmen, the Red Queen stalked through the Grasp\u2019s commercial decks, the so-called Festival Levels. She didn\u2019t look like the queen of the most hated Unbound cartel in the galaxy. She wore a simple black uniform, cuffs and collar decorated with patterns of blue flame, with the closed crimson gauntlet of her cartel over her left breast and her \u2018royal\u2019 rank pips on her collar. Her hair hung loosely down her back. Instead of the various natural brown, black, red or blonde hues that she could have had, her hair was the colour of sun-kissed seas, the result of genetic alterations made to her before she\u2019d been born. Her features were those of a young woman, with full red lips, blue eyes that matched the hue of her hair and pale, unblemished skin that showed not a single of the burns, cuts or gunshots that she\u2019d suffered over the decades. In fact, there was no trace of her eighty-one years of life on her features at all. Her genetics had nothing to do with that.", "Broken were rare in the galaxy; few beings could have said with authority that she shouldn\u2019t look as young as she did. Any who could would simply assume like many of her Unbound peers, Adrianna had indulged her vanity with cosmetic surgery, and illegal age-extending treatments. They were partially right.", "The woman strode through the crowds, merchants, traders, travellers, smugglers, pirates and thieves all stumbling, scurrying or jumping out of her path. Adrianna suppressed the smile at that. As a human, she would normally be among the lowest of the low of the Compact\u2019s client races. Broken were good for nothing but sucking up tax dollars on their distant, pathetic little world. Weak, dull-eyed, ugly apes who owed their very existence to their betters. Possibly not even truly intelligent as certain scholars pontificated, only imitating higher-level thinking without being capable of it themselves. But she wasn\u2019t just a human, was she? She was the Red Queen, the ruler of the Red Hand and now, one of the Five.", "And are I not so pleased by the honour? she thought sardonically.", "The Five were the heads of the most powerful Unbound cartels in the galaxy. It was a surprisingly restrained title for beings who lived and died by the amount of grandeur and self-aggrandizement that they could gather to themselves. Still, the men and women who led those clans commanded more power and wealth then many star nations and were responsible for more suffering and death than all but the largest state-sanctioned atrocities. Drug-running, murder, assassination, piracy, drugs, bootlegging, black marketeering, extortion, the flesh trade. There was little illicit behaviour in the Compact that did not in some way lead back to one of the Five. The Blotted Suns, Seven Inversions, Hollow Words and Sorrowmakers were the first four. The Charred Temples had once had the Red Hand\u2019s place until their \u2018Lord of Ash\u2019 had overreached himself. Coveting Leblanc\u2019s wealth, he had demanded that the Red Hand submit themselves to his clan, believing that they\u2019d been drained from the Understone Heresies. A cartel led by a mere Broken would, inevitably submit to the authority of one of their betters. Whether or not that lesson had to be pounded into the head of the Broken in question was always a matter of debate.", "It was always the same, arrogance and sneering superiority bundled together to dismiss anything and everything she\u2019d ever done. She\u2019d spent sixty-three years fighting against that sentiment and it seemed like she\u2019d made no headway at all. No matter what she did, no matter how many victories she won, how many Compact soldiers and Unbound rivals lay dead at her feet, there was always someone who believed that no clan led by a weak, pathetic Broken could ever be as good as the rumours insisted. Lucky, yes. But a Broken playing at war? Leading those deluded, desperate and dumb enough to follow her? Ridiculous. Insulting.", "Adrianna had been... disinclined to bow to the Lord of Ash. What followed was known to the galaxy\u2019s fringe as the Year of Fire. The Charred Temples had had numerical superiority, but the Red Hand\u2019s officers and leaders were fresh from the crucible of Understone while the Charred Temples were pirates who preferred unfair fights and smugglers who strove to avoid any combat at all. Few of them were a match for Leblanc\u2019s battle-hardened veterans and the Red Hand\u2019s victories mounted. At the outset of the conflict, the Lord of Ash had built a pyre, promising that it was where the Red Queen\u2019s life would end. Instead, he\u2019d been the one who burned upon it, his surviving leaders kneeling in submission to her before his blackened, smoking bones. The war had been costly, pushing Adrianna\u2019s already over-stretched forces to the brink, but she had eked out victory through superior tactics, strategy and a sheer bloody-minded determination to climb over the bodies of the dead until she succeeded. Still, her victory was expensive. If one of the remaining Five had decided to strike at the moment, she would have lost.", "They had not. It was a lesson she\u2019d learned very early on: the Unbound respected strength. Be the alpha bitch. It doesn\u2019t matter how badly you\u2019re hurt if all they see is what\u2019s left of the last idiot to challenge you. Whether it would cut too much into their profit margins, whether they\u2019d hated the Charred Temples more than her, whether they were afraid of losing as well, or they\u2019d decided that the cost of winning wasn\u2019t worth it hadn\u2019t mattered in the end. The other clans had watched their compatriot fall and done nothing. They\u2019d even offered her the Lord of Ash\u2019s place. It hadn\u2019t been out of gratitude or generosity. You kept what you killed. Another law of the fringe. She\u2019d brought down one of the Five. They couldn\u2019t ignore her as \u2018lucky\u2019 any longer. Their own traditions demanded that she be recognized.", "Oh, they had hated that. She wasn\u2019t the first member of a client race to become one of the Five, but.... lowest of the low. Her new peers were loathe to sully themselves by associating with a Broken and she knew they\u2019d argued over the \u2018insult\u2019 of even offering her a place among their ranks. Some hadn\u2019t thought she\u2019d take it; her contempt for most other Unbound was no secret. Pretentious little sow \u2013 that was what she was. A delusional megalomaniac who spat on the established customs and laws of the fringe. They weren\u2019t wrong there, but she\u2019d surprised everyone by accepting.", "An absentee ruler, she only rarely visited the Grasp, preferring to ignore the machinations of her peers in favour of her cause. It suited the other members of the Five perfectly. The tangled latticework of rivalries, alliances, betrayals and hatreds between the Unbound rulers ran deep, often going back centuries. Each of them was constantly looking for an advantage over their supposed \u2018good friends and colleagues\u2019, but there was one point that all of the other members of the Five could agree on: they hated the human upstart.", "They hated that they had lower themselves to treat a Broken as an equal, they hated that she had taken a minor cartel and turned it into a juggernaut, growing it faster than almost any other clan in history. They hated the attention her actions brought on the rest of them. The Compact may have wanted each of them dead and their cartels scattered to the four winds, but it despised her and the Red Hand and would do anything for the chance to destroy either.", "Those were just a handful of the many and varied reasons each of her peers hated her. They wouldn\u2019t move against her, though. What she\u2019d done to the Charred Temples was a potent example and no single one of them would risk the same fate. An alliance was possible, but so far none of those kings and queens trusted their erstwhile partners enough to propose such a thing. The old hatreds ran very deep indeed. Not without cause: if those same allies believed that they could get a better deal from the Red Hand, they would certainly inform Leblanc of the plot. She\u2019d shown in the past that if she believed a clan was preparing to move against her, she would strike first. No one wanted to be caught unprepared thanks to a \u2018trusted confidante\u2019. Their best chance to kill her had already passed; she\u2019d rebuilt her strength and her fleets were expanding, but that didn\u2019t mean she was invulnerable.", "It was a precarious dance. Being one of the Five offered incredible influence and wealth, both of which she needed for her war, but she was all too aware of just how much her \u2018good friends and allies\u2019 hated and feared her. The Charred Temples had been the weakest of the Five; that had been one of the reasons the Lord of Ash had moved on the Red Hand. He\u2019d wanted to strengthen his position and adding her fleets to his cartel would have done that. The other four lords and ladies each commanded at least as much firepower as Leblanc did and their fleets weren\u2019t spread nearly as wide as her own. They didn\u2019t have the same quality of leaders or caliber of followers, but quantity was a quality all its own. If any of her good friends believed that she was weak, they would strike. Weakness was death in the fringe.", "If that happened, she would be victorious. She believed that wholeheartedly, but the cost would be more than she was willing to pay, especially now with Operation Kursk on the cusp of triggering. Her resources were devoted to building her fleet and expanding her reach throughout the Compact. On a thousand worlds, the downtrodden whispered in shadows of the Red Hand while their oppressors stared at reports of her movements and felt worry gnaw at their guts. That was her cause. Not the clinking of coins or the spilling of blood. Freedom. Justice. Revenge.", "She wasn\u2019t just another pirate queen or self-styled ruler. She was a revolutionary and the cause meant everything to her. The killing would never stop. Not until the Compact lay in ruins and humanity and every other slave race was free of their chains. That was a promise she\u2019d made nearly fifty years ago. There was nothing she wouldn\u2019t do to further her cause and if that made her a monster too, then so be it. When she died, there\u2019d be an accounting. Until then, she would do anything and everything to bring the Compact one step closer to its demise.", "She\u2019d live with the dreams.", "Adrianna arrived at her destination: The Velvet Purse. The bouncers scrambled to clear the entry way for her and her armsmen. The Purse was an entertainment complex that rose through six levels of the station\u2019s Festival Levels. In Hadrashi, the name was a euphemism for female genitals. The original owner of the club must have thought he or she was terribly clever. In three decades, none of the other owners had bothered to change the name.", "The human stepped inside, her vision instantly adjusting to the lower light levels. Her nose twitched at the scents of dozens of species. The odours of sweat and sex permeated the air along with the chemical tang of intoxicants and narcotics. Dirt and perfume, grease and food. She could identify each individual affront to her senses. The main floor was largely open, with small stages and walkways branching off the walls next to the bar and buffets \u2013 apparently the food was actually quite good. The primary stage took up the far wall, with catwalks and circular dancing platforms extending out from it. There were doorways to private rooms and other parts of the complex set into the side walls, concealed stairwells and elevators ready to convey patrons to the other levels and their own distractions. Tables \u2013 some with dancers atop them, some with food, some with both \u2013 were scattered across the floor, waiters, waitresses customers and strippers winding amongst them. Music throbbed at frequencies unpleasant to human ears, a DJ excitedly listing the virtues of the dancers, adjusting the lights to focus on a particular entertainer at a time.", "On each of the stages, large and small, men, women and beings of indeterminate sex gyrated, shedding clothes to the appreciative hooting and jeers of the crowd. Officially, this was the refined \u2018gentlebeings\u2019 level of the club, where sapients could relax with a drink, a meal and take in a dance or two. It was cleaner than many other places she\u2019d seen, some which were on the Grasp themselves, but the decorations couldn\u2019t hide what it truly was. Every touch of class that each owner had added was just a thin veneer. Sex workers plied their trade openly with the clients, leading them to the private rooms once a price had been arranged. For a little more, you could even have one of the strippers whether they particularly wanted it or not. They were here; that was all the consent that was necessary.", "One of the Purse\u2019s hostesses materialized out of the crowd. A Didact, she was wearing barely more than any of the performers. Her fur was close-shaven and her normally puffy tail was almost completely trimmed. It looked sad and rat-like. \u201cHighness,\u201d the hostess bowed low, her nose twitching in anxiety. \u201cThe Velvet Purse is honoured by your presence. Please, forgive my tardiness in attending you; we were not expecting your august self this evening. What may I do to serve?\u201d She didn\u2019t introduce herself. It would be inappropriate to do so unless asked, otherwise it would presume that she was worthy of Adrianna\u2019s attention. Originally a Didact custom, over the centuries it had spread throughout menials across the fringe.", "Adrianna tipped her head towards the hostess. \u201cPlease inform Kih Vanig that I wanted to speak with him at his earliest convenience.\u201d She smiled, though she didn\u2019t show her teeth; the gesture unsettled Didacts.", "\u201cKih Vanig is very busy today,\u201d the hostess said, but she was quick to continue. When an Unbound ruler arrived on your doorstep, only a fool pretended \u2018earliest convenience\u2019 meant anything other than right now. \u201cHowever, I am certain that he will make time for your august self, Highness. He has been extremely pleased with the diligence and capability of your people.\u201d She spoke into a comm unit masquerading as floral brooch, chittering in her native language. A second passed before she received a response and she visibly relaxed. More than one Unbound king or queen had presented those who kept them cooling their heels with the head \u2013 or assorted other body parts \u2013 of the underling unfortunate enough to inform them they would have to wait on their host\u2019s convenience. Adrianna hadn\u2019t yet killed a messenger for bearing bad news, but no one wanted to be the first. \u201cPlease, Highness,\u201d the hostess gestured towards the elevator. \u201cIf you\u2019ll follow me to kih Vanig\u2019s office?\u201d", "Adrianna did so, winding through the crowd. The Purse was doing brisk business tonight. A lot of new talent was on display, young men, women and assorted other genders either parading or being paraded around in front of the customers. Some taunted the crowd, wearing genuine (or a very good imitation of it) grins, trading barbs for catcalls, salacious overtures for jeers and insinuations of inadequacy or poverty for demands. Other entertainers had the fixed expressions of happiness that narcotics and the promise of a paycheque could provide. Others wore the kinds of smiles that you wore if you didn\u2019t want to get a beating for being unappealing. Leblanc held her hands behind her back, her fingers digging into her palms.", "One lech, too drunk to recognize the woman, actually tried to reach for her. She slapped his hand away, never breaking stride, but one of her armsmen moved in, seizing the offending limb. Adrianna didn\u2019t look back, not even for the howl of pain and wet snap of bone as her soldier stood up for his queen\u2019s honour and administered the appropriate corrective measures. Ventl\u2019s work. He was the more direct of the two. Brauz considered himself a frustrated thespian and preferred to inject melodrama into his job. They got to do so little, so she let them have the small things. Most Tribunes would have found it unbearably humiliating to serve under a mere Broken, but Brauz and Ventl had served her faithfully for many years. Be the alpha bitch.", "A pair of the club\u2019s bouncers had kept the elevator waiting for her, shooing away the handful of customers that wanted to use it themselves. Once they\u2019d reached the uppermost level, Leblanc followed the hostess to the manager\u2019s office. Vanig was sitting behind an expensive yilldin oak desk, but he rose to his feet the instant she stepped across the threshold. He had a pair of bodyguards with him, one on each side of the desk. A Worker and another Tribune. The former was covered in tattoos. It must have cost him a fortune to have them done; Worker skin was notoriously tough. The latter appeared to be just another Tribune renegade. Unlike her armsmen, who hadn\u2019t yet been caught by the Compact, this one had been legally exiled from his nation. His lower daylight eyes had been blinded. It was an old Vamanoa custom, one that the Compact had never quite been able to stamp out, though it was becoming increasingly less common. Either that guard had found himself before a hardliner judge, or he\u2019d pissed off the wrong person. Both men stiffened into a crude facsimile of military attention as their employer stood, their hands staying close to their weapons, but not so close that Adrianna or her armsmen might consider them a threat.", "\u201cAnnouncing Her Highness Adrianna Josephine Leblanc, Queen of the Red Hand,\u201d the hostess said. \u201cIgniter of the Magnameric Canyon, Arch-Heretic of Understone, Lady of Ash...\u201d", "Adrianna tuned out the fawning diatribe. Every Unbound ruler of any standing had a plethora of titles for all their various misdeeds, even if they had to invent each one themselves. She\u2019d never cared enough to bother. It was actually a perverse point of pride for her that not one of many names the poor girl was rattling off had been invented by anyone from her own clan. When it looked like the Didact was running out of breath but was too afraid to stop the litany, Leblanc waved dismissively for her to be silent. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said to the woman. \u201cYou\u2019ve memorized more of them than I have.\u201d", "\u201cYou can go now,\u201d Vanig told the hostess and the Didact vanished from the room.", "\u2018Kih\u2019 Axex Vanig was a Pedlar, another of the Compact\u2019s client races. Pedlars were something of a macabre cross between a hyena, a porcupine and a human. Unlike many other species, they had become upright relatively late in their evolutionary history and they stood stoop-shouldered, their bodies covered in a fine, spotted coat of fur, except for the carpet of sharp quills that jutted from their heads and backs. Tailors asked to design clothes for Pedlar clients often experienced a level of frustration unbeknownst to many others in the galaxy. Hunched forward, his hands laid over one another, Vanig was the very picture of clutching greed. That, of course was a human-centric view. To Workers, such a posture indicated both age and generosity. To Tribunes, it was a submissive pose, that of one who knew their place amongst their betters, or that of someone apologizing for some slight.", "Which was what Vanig should be doing if he had any sense at all. Then again, if he had she wouldn\u2019t have had to come here.", "The club owner tried to affect what he must have imagined to be a human smile, his lips pulling away from his teeth. His beady black eyes stared at the Red Queen as he leaned across the desk to meet her, taking her hands in his paws. \u201cMajesty of Fire,\u201d he purred. Or what passed for a purr; Pedlar speech was guttural and harsh and grated in Adrianna\u2019s ears. \u201cI am deeply honoured by your visit.\u201d He sounded completely sincere, but Adrianna could hear the nervous flutter of his heart and the slight shortness of his breath. Her presence here was a surprise and he didn\u2019t care for surprises.", "Vanig was an influential man. In another time and culture, he would have been considered a powerful mafia don. Though he had a handful of legitimate businesses, his money mostly came from prostitution, loan-sharking, smuggling, tariff-dodging and the assorted softer sides of the fringe. He wore custom-tailored clothes, expensive, ostentatious jewellery hung from his neck and gleamed from every finger. He was worth millions. He had contacts in almost every world in the Sector and his word could set you up for life... or break you down to nothing.", "To one of the Five, he was strictly small-time. He was also a vassal of the Blotted Suns and wore their sigil on his lapel... but only when he had to. He was ambitious and chafed at being someone else\u2019s underling, but with service came certain benefits. First among them was the protection of the larger clan, so Adrianna couldn\u2019t just pull his head off as she dearly wanted to. She idly wondered how hard it would be. His neck was thick and heavily muscled, but Vanig was still only meat and bone and she... wasn\u2019t. Not really.", "\u201cTo what do I owe the glory your presence visits upon my meager hovel?\u201d the Pedlar continued, grovelling appropriately, completely unaware that his guest was fantasizing about murdering him. \u201cDo you require any refreshments?\u201d", "\u201cNo, thank you for the offer.\u201d She smiled back, playing through the required theater of feigned niceties. Vanig was not well-versed in human expressions and he took her expression to be as genuine as his attempt. Aside from Adrianna, the only other Broken he had any contact with was one of the girls that worked downstairs. \u201cThank you for meeting me on such short notice,\u201d she said, taking a seat. Vanig sat back in his own chair and leaned forward, resting his hands on the desktop. \u201cI merely wanted to stop by and express my pleasure that my cartel was able to assist you in your time of need. Have you resolved your cargo issues?\u201d", "\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Vanig assured her. \u201cThe strike has ended. The dockworkers return to their duties. It took only a proper... persuasion to get the union heads to come to an acceptable accommodation.\u201d", "The Grasp was, technically, not an illegal colony. There were a great number of law-abiding (or something resembling law-abiding) citizens that lived on the station and a great deal of \u2018looking the other way\u2019 happened, assisted by the dutiful application of money and threats. Despite the influx of bribes and graft to make sure that cargo and provisions moved without such trifles as appropriate safety and security measures, the payment of taxes, tariffs and fees, the dutiful investigations for, and the reporting of contraband, or the other dozen-odd major statutes that the Grasp\u2019s dockworkers routinely ignored, you could only push so far. To the ship leaders that visited the Grasp, adherence to safety regulations was less valuable than the expeditious loading and unloading of their cargo and they paid the Quartermasters\u2019 Guild well to ignore the occasional accident, but the Blotted Suns had gotten extraordinarily sloppy of late. Three dockworkers had died in the last month due to the clan\u2019s carelessness.", "One had been mauled by a pack of endangered Krythinian hounds who had escaped their pen. Another had been crushed by improperly secured cargo pallets that had shifted during unloading and the third had been the unluckiest of several workers to suffer radiation poisoning as a consequence of faulty shielding. The Guild\u2019s officials had taken decisive action \u2013 helped in no small part by assurances from the dockworkers themselves that if those officials did not do something, they would find themselves working the Blotted Suns\u2019 docks. The Guild had put a stop order on the movement of any of the cartel\u2019s cargo until they started putting a modicum of effort into safety measures. This had put the Blotted Suns in a very awkward position and none of their people more so than Kih Vanig, who\u2019d had two freighters of valuable cargo sitting just off the Grasp at the time the strike was declared.", "The Guild had flatly refused to negotiate and every other Unbound clan that the Pedlar talked to graciously offered him the service of their docks (with a small remuneration to the Guild to assure them that those weren\u2019t really Blotted Suns ships)... provided his cargo was subject to the full and complete inspection that the law required. After all, they couldn\u2019t possibly be party to something illegal! The joke had taken on a life of its own and clan after clan had all insisted that they would be delighted to help... but only if proper legalities were observed. Some did it because they were Vanig\u2019s competitors. Others did it because they didn\u2019t want the Guild to become annoyed at them and still others did it because they found it funny and because they knew where Vanig would inevitably have to turn.", "Finally, hat in hand, he\u2019d come to the Red Hand to request the use of their docks, his very last recourse. Adrianna had not been on the station \u2013 she tried to avoid being in one place for too long, and Overseer of Trade Operations Tavanis had made the agreement on the Red Hand\u2019s behalf. Vanig would cover the bribes the Red Hand would offer to the Guild, plus a fee for \u2018services rendered\u2019. He would owe the Red Hand a favour in the future and he would swear that his cargo was not intended, nor would be used against the Red Hand and that it was not among the revolution\u2019s list of prohibited goods. That list was very short, but it was longer than that of many other clans. All in all, it was a very fair deal.", "Vanig had also asked for complete privacy while his personnel and the dockworkers handled the cargo. That was not unusual. No clan wanted to reveal their business to another, nor tempt them. It would not be the first time that one cartel while ostensibly helping another, decided that betraying their good friends was more profitable. It was quite possible that some of Adrianna\u2019s own people might decide to help themselves to some of Vanig\u2019s cargo if they thought that they could get away with it. So the confidentiality of Vanig\u2019s cargo had been arranged and by the laws of the fringe, was sacrosanct.", "\u201cI\u2019m so pleased to hear that you were able to iron out your difficulties with the Quartermasters\u2019 Guild,\u201d Adrianna said, layering her voice with syrupy sweetness. \u201cI\u2019m even more pleased that my clan was able to assist you in your time of need. I feel this is the start of a new, more open relationship between my Red Hand and your patrons. I did just have one minor question for you. It\u2019s nothing, really. I almost feel bad about taking up your time to ask it.\u201d She batted her eyelashes.", "\u201cMy time is yours,\u201d Vanig replied, gesturing expansively, but his nervousness hadn\u2019t eased. He did not like this topic of conversation.", "\u201cThat makes me very happy,\u201d Adrianna. She met the Pedlar\u2019s small dark eyes. When she spoke again, her voice was still honey-sweet. \u201cDid you really think you could bring slaves through my docks and I wouldn\u2019t find out?\u201d", "Vanig\u2019s black, beady eyes widened. \u201cSlaves?\u201d he said, affecting a quizzical expression. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019ve heard, but I know full well the Red Hand\u2019s position on the flesh trade. I would never break trust for-\u201d he stopped talking when Adrianna slid a datascroll across the table. Tavanis had acquired it from one of the clan\u2019s contacts, but he hadn\u2019t acted on it. He\u2019d assumed that his queen would wish to see it herself. He\u2019d been right.", "Adrianna tapped the play button and a grainy video started up. It had been taken just over a week ago, inside the Red Hand\u2019s docks. The video had been taken clandestinely, but it what it showed was clear enough. Several of Vanig\u2019s shuttles were being offloaded and a collection of Vanig\u2019s grunts stood around, overseeing the cargo transfer. There were pallets being moved back and forth as well as several large containers, one of which had a cordon of armed men and women loitering nearby it. One of Vanig\u2019s men, a Didact was walking towards the container, dragging a smaller, younger woman of his own species by the arm. Her clothes were disheveled. There was no audio. A Steerswoman said something to the Didact man, he replied and she laughed, gesturing for another pair of guards to open the crate. The female Didact was shoved inside. The angle was bad and it was dark in the cargo container, but it was clear that there were more people within.", "\u201cFirst of all, I must of course apologize for the breach of trust. You asked for complete privacy in your cargo transfer and my people failed to deliver that.\u201d Adrianna\u2019s voice dripped sarcasm. \u201cRest assured that the individual who acquired the evidence of your deception has been appropriately disciplined. However,\u201d when the Red Queen spoke again, her voice was the temperature of frozen helium, lacking even the slightest hint of feign playfulness. \u201cYou lied.\u201d", "\u201cHow... how did...\u201d", "\u201cMy Hand reaches far,\u201d Adrianna quipped. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what others say?\u201d The woman leaned forward, baring her teeth. \u201cYou brought slaves through my docks,\u201d she repeated, all but growling each syllable. \u201cWhat was it that you told Tavanis? \u2018Entertainment goods, pharmaceutical and chemical stores\u2019? Clever, but Tavanis has a suspicious mind. You\u2019re a cheap bastard, Vanig. Your ships are one overhaul from the junkyard and you run them with the bare minimum of crew and stores that they need.  When the dockworkers went on strike you suddenly had holds full of \u2018talent\u2019 that might just die before you could sell them off. Or were you afraid of a riot? A bunch of starving slaves overrunning the crew you\u2019re too cheap to outfit properly?\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019re not slaves,\u201d Vanig protested. \u201cThey are-\u201d", "\u201cI know how the game works,\u201d Adrianna interrupted. He\u2019d just come apart in my hands... \u201cWe\u2019re not playing semantics today. \u2018Contract workers\u2019 whose passports you keep, pretty young things you get addicted to drugs and then break in, tossing them just enough money to stay addicted. I call that slavery. Brauz.\u201d", "\u201cYes, Highness?\u201d the armsman said. His voice was a deep rumble, like the shifting of rocks before an avalanche. Despite his penchant for theatrics, he enjoyed violence and always looked forward to those times when his queen allowed him to indulge himself.", "\u201cWhat is the one cargo I absolutely will not traffic in, nor will I allow any of my vassal clans to do so?\u201d", "\u201cSlaves, Majesty. You have forbidden all flesh-trafficking in the Red Hand and all those cartels who wish to submit to us. No life held in servitude passes through our holds, our ships or our docks.\u201d", "\u201cAnd why is that, Braun?\u201d", "\u201cYour Majesty\u2019s most oft-stated reason is \u2018because I said so\u2019, though Her Highness frequently inserts the human epithet based around sexual contact into that phrase.\u201d", "\u201cAnd what do I do to people who violate this very simple rule?\u201d", "The Tribune spared the barest moment to grin down at the Pedlar. \u201cYou kill them, Majesty.\u201d", "\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Vanig protested, trying to sound more assured than he felt. His hands were braced on the table to help steady himself, his quills were standing up and the fur on his back rippled with agitation. \u201cI\u2019m not one of your submissives.\u201d He tapped the emblem of the Blotted Suns on his lapel. Not even the Red Queen would be mad enough to risk starting another clan war.", "\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Adrianna admitted. \u201cI can\u2019t kill you. Your patrons would be obliged to retaliate. Your life isn\u2019t worth the loss of any of my people. Still... principles are worth fighting for. You broke a contract and lied. There should be some response.\u201d she turned to look at Vanig\u2019s Tribune bodyguard. \u201cKih Servas \u2013 what do you think?\u201d", "Vanig\u2019s brow furrowed as he tried to understand why Leblanc was addressing his bodyguard. Unbeknownst to the Pedlar, Sevras had a graduate degree in Political Science and was an advisor to the Blotted Suns\u2019 Chairman of Auxiliary Enterprises, helping to inform policy on the relations between the cartel itself and affiliates like Vanig. Right now, the Tribune was looking down at the Pedlar with his good eyes, a contemplative expression on his face. \u201cThe protection of an Unbound cartel must always be inviolate,\u201d he drawled. \u201cWithout it, loyalty would vanish. If a cartel\u2019s agents can be killed by a rival and that rival suffers no retribution, it shows the cartel to be weak. Weakness is death. The Blotted Suns can no more let the execution of one of our submissives at the hands of a rival pass any more than the Red Hand. However,\u201d he added. \u201cThe arrangement between Kih Vanig and the Red Hand was not made in good faith. If such deception is not answered, it shows that the deceived is weak and unable to stand up for themselves, that they deserved to be tricked and it invites others to attempt the same. Honour must be satisfied.\u201d", "\u201cThat is what I thought,\u201d Adrianna replied. \u201cThank you.\u201d", "No one saw the human move. One instant her hands were resting on the edge of the desk and the next she had a knife buried to the hilt in Vanig\u2019s left hand, pinning the man\u2019s meaty paw to the desk. Servas did not attempt to defend his employer. His Worker comrade seemed about to, but saw that he was very much alone and outgunned. Vanig howled in agony. He made a grab for the knife with his good hand, but Adrianna caught him by the wrist. His arm was almost as thick around as her leg, but she forced it back down easily. Muscles bulged in the Pedlar\u2019s limb as he struggled to resist the Broken\u2019s impossible strength. He was blinking back tears of pain. \u201cShoot her!\u201d he shouted. \u201cShoot her!\u201d", "Adrianna looked up at Sevras. Behind her, Brauz and Ventl had their weapons up, each one covering a different bodyguard. \u201cWell?\u201d", "The Tribune\u2019s hands stayed where they were. \u201cWill it end here?\u201d", "Leblanc considered the question, watching Vanig squirm and whimper. \u201cYes,\u201d she answered.", "Relieved, Servas slowly lifted his hands away from his weapons, his counterpart doing the same. It was shameful for a bodyguard to let his employer be assaulted, but Vanig\u2019s deception had been discovered. The Blotted Suns were not in the habit of saving their vassals from their own stupidity and the club owner had earned that blade. Now he would know that the protection his patrons offered had its limits. The Blotted Suns had allowed the Red Hand to respond to the insult done to them. Honour was satisfied on all accounts.", "Adrianna leaned across the desk, her fingers still wrapped around the hilt of the dagger. Vanig\u2019s other hand was clawing deep marks in the polished wood surface, unable to shift Adrianna\u2019s arm by a centimeter. \u201cI want you to remember this, Kih,\u201d she whispered \u201cI want you to remember how I put a knife through your hand and your guards just let it happen.\u201d Her voice softened further. \u201cThe only reason you\u2019re still alive is because you suckle on your precious Lady\u2019s teats. That won\u2019t save you again. The next time you lie to me or mine, I will burn your little empire down around you and then I will come for you. I will go to war with the Blotted Suns if I have to. I will tear my way through Hell itself to get at you. Do you understand?\u201d When no answer was immediately forthcoming, she twisted the dagger. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d", "\u201cYes!\u201d barked Vanig. \u201cYes, I understand!\u201d", "\u201cGood,\u201d Adrianna let go of the knife and rose to her feet. \u201cI\u2019m glad we could iron all this out. Thank you very much for your time, kih. I look forward to our next transaction. Like I said, I believe the cooperation and forthrightness shown here today will lead to a new age for relations between our clans.\u201d She bowed theatrically. \u201cI know you are a busy man, so I will leave you to your day\u2019s work.\u201d As she left, she could hear him hissing curses impugning among other things, her fertility, fecundity and the parentage of any children she had or would possibly have in the future.", "As she left the Purse, her comm chirped. \u201cSorry to disturb you, commander,\u201d It was Drexil, Eisheth\u2019s leader. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some news that I thought you might want to hear. Are you still in negotiations?\u201d", "\u201cNo, I just finished up. What news?\u201d", "\u201cPale Liberation has just shown up in-system. They\u2019ve gotten a docking berth at the Grasp.\u201d", "Adrianna blinked. She hadn\u2019t been expecting the corvette back for quite some time and definitely not here. There shouldn\u2019t even be anyone on it to make docking requests! \u201cWho is \u2018they\u2019?\u201d she demanded.", "\u201cUnknown, commander. We could intercept...?\u201d", "\u201cNegative, let them dock.\u201d There were some things she kept her loyal (and not-so-loyal) followers unaware of. Where Pale Liberation had been sent was one of them.", "\u201cVery well. Would you like us to send a reception over?\u201d", "\u201cNo. Give me their berth number. I\u2019ll meet them myself.\u201d She thought for a moment. \u201cBut ready a team of Bloodsworn, just in case.\u201d"]}

Both were risky propositions for a young Naiad.", "The queen herself had lived for nearly four thousand years. She had borne hundreds of children, hunted and killed prey and rivals alike. She had swept worlds clean of infestation, bathed in the light of suns and danced along the event horizons of black holes. In all the hundreds of billions of stars throughout the galaxy, she acknowledged only four equals. Her name was impossible for any organic to conceptualize, let alone pronounce and Red One had given her a simpler appellation. Zenobia tolerated it. She tolerated much from the Spearsong, but then the once-prey had earned that tolerance as well as trust and respect. It and those marked by it were the only deadtone creatures allowed within these stars. All others were prey, to do with as the Naiads pleased.

Though their ship would normally be home to several hundred crew, the four cadets had kept to their usual routines, meeting up for morning runs through the corridors. The ship\u2019s databanks also held a fair number of entertainment vids and games. Between those and their continued training, the crew had put their time to good use. Lydia and Marcus had gotten the basics of bridge operations under them, and they\u2019d assisted the \u2018officers\u2019 in developing plans and contingencies for various situations \u2013 some realistic, some less so \u2013 that they might encounter. Grace and Allyria had also spent more than a little time doing what came naturally to two young, healthy people in close quarters.

Ever since Sol, Grace had been fascinated by how Red One saw things and how the AI thought, but she\u2019d never been as focused on it as she was now. The Verrish sat on the edge of the desk, cocking her head and reading Grace\u2019s notes. Anvil 731 was a fortress system, several thousand light years from their current position. It was a mustering point for the Expansion Forces being sent against the Principality and the Exploration fleets pushing towards unexplored space. There were rumours of something going on out there, but Allyria had no idea what that \u2018something\u2019 could be.

They came and went as the Compact grew, as its worlds developed and its strategies and plans shifted. Some were vulnerable for only a few weeks, others for years. Some of those systems didn\u2019t even know how vulnerable they were. Others did and strove to shore up their defences. Red might be alone, but she had spent two thousand years watching the Compact, taking classified data from ships and systems that she raided, infecting computer systems with harvest worms, gathering intelligence, analyzing military movements, logistical networks, governmental policies and sociopolitical movements, looking for weaknesses that organic minds hadn\u2019t been able to divine or prevent. She saw all these... and was helpless to act. One vessel, no matter how determined, could never do more than bleed the Compact a little at a time.

Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m trying to convince myself that it will be impossible to take any of these systems... because if it wasn\u2019t, billions of people would die.\u201d She put a hand over her eyes, ashamed of admitting that. Grace hated the Compact as much as any of them, but she counted the cost of it the most.", "Allyria touched Grace\u2019s cheek again. The shorter girl made a soft sound, leaning into the caress. Both of them knew that she\u2019d keep looking, the human trying to understand something that was fundamentally inhuman. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to win,\u201d she said after a moment. \u201cNot after all they\u2019ve done to us. Our homeworlds. Our nations, our people. They never showed us any mercy. We were only spared because of her.\u201d Allyria nodded. For half a century, the Compact had hunted the survivors of their culling, determined to extirpate all traces of \u2018racial madness\u2019, shedding crocodile tears and wringing their hands over the deed. Damaged and half-mad, Nemesis had tracked down an execution force and the human convoy they were pursuing. Though the human records of the deed hadn\u2019t survived, the Compact\u2019s had. That was where Nemesis had first been called \u2018the Wound\u2019, an ever-bleeding injury in their flesh. Her warning to the Verrisha had allowed them to defy the Compact \u2013 for a time, at least. To force them to expend so much effort on one little world that they\u2019d had to grit their teeth and offer some small concessions to end the fighting rather than pay for the total victory they\u2019d wanted. Without the Angel, humanity would be dead and the Verrisha would be even more of a slave race than they were.", "\u201cThe Compact needs to pay for all they\u2019ve done,\u201d Grace said. Her words were soft, but forceful. \u201cI want that. I want them to remember us, to be forced to admit every wrong. I just...\u201d she made another muted keen. When she\u2019d been younger, she\u2019d gotten more than one talking-to for doing that. Her parents had been concerned that more of Allyria was rubbing off on her than the other way around. Don\u2019t do that, her father had said. It\u2019s inappropriate. You\u2019re a human. You talk, you don\u2019t growl or snarl like her. Her mother had been less firm, but the admonishment had been much the same. Act like a proper person, not like a Brute. Once she\u2019d entered her teens, she\u2019d only done it a handful of times and only when it was just the two of them.", "\u201c...wish the cost wasn\u2019t so high.\u201d Allyria finished. Grace\u2019s anger ran almost as deep as hers, but the Verrish didn\u2019t have it in her to care about the cost. Vara\u2019s population had been decimated when the Compact set their Tribune hounds on the world to bring them into \u2018compliance\u2019. She\u2019d grown up in ruins and refugee camps and she\u2019d joined the Academy knowing that she would one day betray the Compact. Anyone who fought for them was her enemy. Whether they were blind, deluded, self-serving or true believers didn\u2019t matter. It was just that simple for her, but not for Grace.", "The human nodded, her face still cradled in Allyria\u2019s hand. Neither said anything for several long moments. \u201cThey\u2019ll remember us,\u201d Grace said at last. \u201cI just want to make sure they remember the right things. That we do the right things, too.\u201d Her eyes flitted back to the screen. \u201cI want to see what she does, too. If I can then... maybe I can help. Maybe I can do something other than hold her coat.\u201d Another moment passed in silence before Grace rose to her feet. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, shaking off her morose thoughts. \u201cLet\u2019s get to the bridge before Lydia jumps the ship without us.\u201d", "Allyria straightened and smiled, her tintas twitching. \u201cAye, captain.\u201d", "~", "\u201cGroup Leader, Submissive. Thank you for accepting my invitation,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro smiled, the gesture still a touch too wide as she gestured for Nasham to enter her private dining room. \u201cPlease, be seated.\u201d", "Nasham dipped his head respectfully, letting the Bastion Leader\u2019s steward show him to his chair. There were only two places set at the table. It was rare for a junior officer to have a seat at a sigil officer\u2019s table and even rarer to be the only guest. \u201cI was honoured to be offered the chance to dine with an officer as acclaimed as yourself, Bastion Leader.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting on his bones as Light of Judgement had completed its \u2018tour\u2019 and trudged up out of Rally\u2019s gravity well. As an \u2018advisor\u2019 appended to the execution force, his duties were rather minimal when the individuals he was supposed to advise neither wanted nor needed his assistance, tolerating his presence with the minimum civility necessary.", "To their credit, the Execution Force\u2019s staff had not been derelict while their command ship lay at anchor. The Chariot\u2019s escorts had been running scouting missions throughout the sector, searching for any trace of Nemesis as survey vessels went through nearby Terrahope with the finest of nets, analyzing every speck of debris that the human warship had left behind. Likewise, many of Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s assistants and observers had used the cover of their inspection to comb through Rally\u2019s military and civilian hierarchies, searching for any individuals who might have any knowledge, or collusion with, the Wound, ferreting out several \u2018problematic\u2019 individuals. It was no less than Nasham himself would have done. At the end of her inspection, there had been a public celebration for the Compact and the Bastion Leader herself. Despite her unease with such events, her speech had gone over well, giving the humans the requisite pat on the head for their efforts while pointing out several areas in which they needed to improve, providing both acknowledgement of what they had done and reminding them that more was required before their joined their \u2018truly civilized\u2019 fellows as a ruling member of the Compact. Keeping them in their place.", "Nasham doubted that many of the cheering crowds that had turned out for the Thoughtful\u2019s send-off had seen it that way. Anyone who\u2019d disagreed had been relegated to the \u2018free speech zones\u2019 that had been strategically placed far away from the cameras and gushing public officials. Not that there had been that many dissenters. Despite the occasional spat of unrest, the humans loved the Compact and revered them as their saviours. Even the deaths of hundreds of their most promising naval cadets had done little to dampen that enthusiasm. More than one family member had come to Nasham, thanking him for his \u2018efforts\u2019 in attempting to save their lost son, daughter or sibling. He was a hero, wasn\u2019t he? The survivor of a disastrous accident aboard Bequeathed when the cruiser\u2019s training run to Terrahope had gone disastrously wrong, quick-thinking and selfless. As the cruiser broke up, he herded a passel of humans into an escape craft... but humans were not Tribunes. They could not survive what his people could and when rescue came, he was the only one left alive and he\u2019d retreated in mourning for all those he could not save.", "It was a lovely story, just what the wounded population needed in this dark hour. It hit all the right notes, from a member of the ruling species looking out for his wards to reinforcing the dangers of the universe without the Compact\u2019s presence. A very lovely story... and every word was a lie.", "Bequeathed had died to treachery and pride. \u2018Discovering\u2019 a wreck of unknown providence, the cruiser\u2019s vainglorious leader had stalled in notifying Local Command, hoping to make his mark. Instead, he\u2019d given an abomination the time it needed to corrupt and destroy the ship. Bequeathed\u2019s human crew had been slaughtered \u2013 betrayed \u2013by the diseased intelligence their people had birthed. He had been spared, not because of any effort or skill on his part but through of the twisted whim of a soulless goddess, the same one that had broken his mind nearly a decade earlier on Invida Station. His \u2018retreat\u2019 had been to a cell as intelligence agents, fleet officers and psychiatrists tried to decide what to do with him. Ultimately, he\u2019d survived and with a sense of purpose he\u2019d never had before: make her pay.", "Nasham took a sip of his water. He\u2019d passed over the steward\u2019s offer of wine. He hadn\u2019t partaken since his return. He was done retreating from the past. The hardest family to meet had been the Proctors. While working on the derelict, he had found an ally of sorts in their daughter. She\u2019d helped him uncover the nagging secrets of the starship, for all the good it had done either of them in the end. She was dead now, murdered by her people\u2019s creation. Her Brute friend as well. More than two hundred young lives of potential snuffed out by that thing, them and countless others. It knew no art, no love, no hope or joy. It was a machine, programmed only to kill. And it is so very proficient at that.", "The Tribune glanced up over the rim of his glass; the Bastion Leader was looking at him. \u201cYour pardon, matron,\u201d he said with a tilt of his head. \u201cI was lost in thought.\u201d", "\u201cEvidently,\u201d the Thoughtful replied. \u201cI was merely congratulating you on your uncle\u2019s recent elevation to the Inner Council.\u201d She took a sip of her own spiced wine and her inner eyelids twitched slightly in pleasant surprise. During its visit, Light of Judgement had taken on several pallets of local liquor. Rally produced some of the finest wines in the galaxy, though few outside the neighbouring sectors ever realized that. As more ships anchored at Rally and passed back into the more cosmopolitan galaxy, demand for local vintages was slowly but steadily increasing. Although liquor for Tribunes and Thoughtful was at best unpalatable to humans, that had not stopped entrepreneurs from expanding their vineyards and production facilities.", "\u201cThank you, matron. He has always been an ambitious man and to represent our people in the highest office seat is all he could ask for.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro blinked. \u201cI am surprised to hear you admit that.\u201d", "Nasham\u2019s lips drew back from his teeth in a smile. \u201cMy uncle has always been the most driven of my family. He\u2019d be the first to agree with my assessment. \u2018Ambition itself is no failing,\u2019 I can hear him say, \u2018It\u2019s only what you do with it.\u2019\u201d", "\u201cI had not thought Councilor Yunn to be so open. He must place a lot of trust in you.\u201d", "\u201cApparently,\u201d Nasham took another brief drink of water. He hadn\u2019t realized quite how much his uncle did until recently. The aroma of their food wafted through the double doors leading to the kitchen and his stomach grumbled.", "\u201cEnough to see you sitting at a Bastion Leader\u2019s table instead of a prison mess,\u201d the Thoughtful\u2019s black eyes glinted.", "Nasham refused to take the bait. \u201cQuite.\u201d He paused a moment. \u201cHuman blood smells of salt and iron. There\u2019s a tang to the aroma, something that you can never forget. Tribune blood is different. There\u2019s more of a metallic scent. The odour is... richer. Thicker, you could say.\u201d He let that sink in for a moment, knowing the woman\u2019s mind was trying to parse the non sequitor. \u201cI remember that the warship\u2019s decks reeked of both. Not just blood, but piss, shit, sweat and everything else that comes from a body when it dies in terror. Invida smelled the much same.\u201d He struggled not to reach for his neck. Even now, he could feel the machine\u2019s grip around his throat as it pushed him down, drops of blood dripping from its faceplate. Tell them, a hateful goddess hissed.", "I did. \u201cThat, more than anything else is what I remember about the massacres. The way the scent of death clung to every inch of every surface. If I close my eyes, I am back there among the dead.\u201d He paused, ordering his thoughts. \u201cYou have doubts about me,\u201d the young man continued. \u201cFair to say. I would have the same in your place. I can offer you no guarantees other that my own word, here and in the records I imagine you\u2019ve seen. I spent years running from Invida. I never wanted to think about it again, but now... now, I still have no answer for why I was the one that survived. All I can do it try to do something with that. To make it pay for its arrogance in whatever way that I can. To give everyone I saw die some measure of justice.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro was silent for a moment. \u201cYou have no idea why it spared you at all?\u201d", "Because you\u2019re a good man, she had told him. \u201cNo,\u201d he lied. That was the one thing he\u2019d held back during his interrogations. The four words that had damned him once already and would have done again. \u201cNothing more than the answer I came to on Invida.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s head twitched slightly. \u201cWhich is?\u201d", "Before Nasham could answer, the kitchen doors opened and Yunl\u2019ro steward billowed out, setting a plate before his superior and one before Nasham. The food looked and smelled exquisite, but he hadn\u2019t expected the chef of a Chariot to be anything less than a master at his craft. Nasham raised his glass, as the most junior officer at a formal dinner was expected to. \u201cFor the fallen,\u201d he declared. The exact toast varied; sometimes it was to the Triarchs, to the Compact as a whole, the Space Force, the honour of a particular guest or cause. \u201cMay there be far fewer of them in years to come.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro tipped her head in acknowledgement and sincere agreement with Nasham\u2019s choice. \u201cThe fallen,\u201d she said, raising her own glass, taking a sip and setting it back down. The Thoughtful didn\u2019t pick up her utensils, looking at Nasham across the table. \u201cAnd you were saying?\u201d she asked.", "The Tribune smiled, ugly memory turning it into a rictus grin. \u201cBastion Leader... the only answer I came up with on that day was that we are the toys of the gods.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s already thin lips disappeared in a disapproving slash. \u201cThere are no gods.\u201d", "\u201cPardon, matron,\u201d Nasham replied. \u201cBut you did ask.\u201d", "\u201cNot for superstition,\u201d the Thoughtful snapped. Her nostril slits flared as she inhaled, taking a moment to cut a slice from her roast sweet yam. Thoughtful were barely carnivorous; their teeth were intended to cut through soft-bodied fruit and crush plant stalks, not rip flesh and crush bone like a Tribune. \u201cDo you know why I asked you to join me for dinner?\u201d", "\u201cI do not, matron.\u201d", "\u201cYour uncle and several others pressed for you to be assigned to my command, my ship,\u201d the Thoughtful said after swallowing. \u201cThey believed that you may be of some use to me on this mission, whether it is through some insight that neither my staff nor I are apparently capable of making, or through some other means. I do not subscribe to either belief and I fought against your placement here.\u201d", "No answer was called for and Nasham remained silent. He\u2019d expected as much.", "\u201cWe are facing a being that should not exist,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro continued. \u201cThe humans\u2019 ignorance has cost countless lives. When and where such things are acknowledged, it is said that the Wound has cost us \u2018only\u2019 a few tens of millions of souls, though that claim is in dispute. Do we count only those that have died directly to it? What about those that perished indirectly? Where is the divide drawn? Other estimates reach easily into hundreds of millions and even higher, but the answer is that we simply do not know how many actually have lain before its guns.\u201d Another slice of yam disappeared. \u201cOne thousand, six hundred and twelve years ago, Column Leader Devon believed that he had divined a pattern to its movements. He took the full force under his command to Rannis Court \u2013 and stumbled into an equally surprised Jackal ghost fleet, wherein both sides tore each other apart. Five hundred and eighty-four years ago, Strategist Yent\u2019ka convinced her superiors that she had located a facility that the Wound was visiting regularly \u2013 a munitions dump or repair facility. After losing nearly seven thousand Janissaries to take the base, it was discovered that the facility\u2019s industrial output was not only too small to service a capital ship, but it was turned entirely to making itself more of a varak nest, creating hallways, levels and chambers filled with nothing but traps and combat drones.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro cut another portion of yam. \u201cThere are similar accounts scattered throughout our history. The machine thinks. It has a mind. It lays traps for us when we are clever, it hunts us when we glance away. There is a tendency for some to anthropomorphize it, to assign it some special significance as a demon or manifestation of sin or other nonsense. I do not. It is a machine, made by primitives. To hear you speak of it in such a way makes my doubts echo in my head, and quite loudly at that. But,\u201d the Thoughtful paused, setting down her utensils.", "\u201cBut?\u201d Nasham queried.", "\u201cBut, I do not gamble with the lives I swore to protect and I will take any possible advantage, no matter how the slight chance of it. But, hearing you describe what happened on Invida and looking over the records of your \u2018convalescence\u2019 makes me consider that you may indeed want this abomination destroyed as much as I and that makes us comrades in cause. As you say, I have my doubts. But I will give Group Leader, Submissive Nasham Kem Unoth Ludhy Inku Pram Vasd the opportunity to assuage my concerns and prove my initial assumptions wrong. That is why you are here. I offer you the hospitality and honesty of the hearth.\u201d", "Nasham nodded. \u201cThen I thank Bastion Leader Yunl\u2019ro for all these things and will do my utmost not to bring disgrace upon her hearth.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s eyelids twitched, surprised that he knew the formal response to her words. For an instant, a sense of camaraderie threatened to blossom between the woman and her subordinate. \u201cDo not thank me,\u201d she said, neither scornful or humble. \u201cProve that you are, indeed, worthy to still carry our nation\u2019s sigil. That you are not the broken relic or potential enemy I take you for.\u201d She picked up her knife, balancing it between her forefingers. \u201cOur mission is of the utmost importance. Nothing must be allowed to interfere with it. Force Command is rapidly approaching the point that all other concerns become secondary to our target\u2019s destruction.\u201d", "His uncle had impressed much the same on him, but Yunn had not offered any further explanation as to why, so soon after the loss of one execution force, another had been mustered. Why now? Why, after two millennia, was the machine\u2019s death becoming so urgent? \u201cI understand,\u201d he said.", "\u201cI hope so, Group Leader, Submissive. I truly do. I will not tolerate anyone or anything that threatens this mission or my people. As ordained by the Triarchs and ordered by Force Command, we will hunt \u2018the Wound\u2019. We will find it and if your \u2018grand dame of chance\u2019 Fortune favours us, we will destroy it.\u201d She said the last with a sardonic smirk.", "\u201cThe galaxy is a very large place,\u201d Nasham pointed out. After its mauling at Sol, the bitch-thing would have retreated into the darkness to lick her injuries. She would be all but impossible to track. \u201cDo we at least have a starting point?\u201d", "The smirk widened. \u201cAs it turns out,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro replied. \u201cWe do.\u201d", "~", "The Grasp\u2019s name was as subtle as everything else about the citadel. It was a massive construct the size of a moonlet, shaped like a hand reaching out towards the stars. It had four fingers and a thumb. The Grasp\u2019s hull was coal-black and below its \u2018wrist\u2019 massive docking spars jutted out into the void like flensed arm bones, each almost as long as rest of the citadel. At a glance, it might be considered to be somewhat similar to a human hand, but each finger was too long and the thumb was situated lower, more towards the wrist. In point of fact, it was stylized after a Yttrian hand. One Yttrian in particular.", "Six hundred years ago, a series of grisly murders plagued the capital city of Jalhan. Over a period of seven years, nine men and women from client races were killed \u2013 at least nine that were known about. With no suspects to speak of, the case languished. However, a single name kept turning up \u2013 that of the famous Judiciary architect Hanik Naajuuum. His connection to the killings was deemed circumstantial and investigating officers were repeatedly cautioned against \u2018alarmist\u2019 actions. This continued until the junior detective Ellesi Sker-litt happened to be in the Jalhan Founding Convention Center, Hanik\u2019s latest masterpiece, following a \u2018circumstantial\u2019 lead. Didacts had eidetic memories. What they were shown once, they never forgot and Ellesi had spent weeks studying the crime scenes and the tableaus that the killer had left behind. When she looked down from the upper levels of the building to the lobby below, she realized that the network of walkways, bubbling aquatic sculptures and waterfalls precisely matched how the seventh victim\u2019s entrails had been spread.", "Her discovery was deemed a coincidence by her superiors, the result of a well-known Didact mental failing, to see patterns where there were none. Sker-litt spent the next three weeks visiting the Convention Center as well as Hanik\u2019s other works, returning to her superiors with six other instances of parts of the tableaus being recreated in the architect\u2019s designs. Once, perhaps twice could still be considered a coincidence. Three times was harder to ignore. Six concrete instances and a host of additional possibilities could not be dismissed and the investigation finally turned towards the architect. Warned by his friends in high places, the Judiciary fled the planet. Officer Ellesi Sker-litt disappeared at the same time. Hanik resurfaced months later, the architect now hiring his services out to Unbound clans. No longer having to hide his depraved inspiration, the architect\u2019s new works showcased his latest tableau.", "The design of the Grasp was his final work before his capture and execution. Though many claimed the fingers were reaching for the stars in ambition, greed or manifest destiny, at his trial Hanik had chortled that it was to exemplify Sker-litt\u2019s last, futile reach for freedom.", "This is where we\u2019re headed, Grace thought dourly. A station envisioned by a serial killer to commemorate the murder of a police officer, built by psychopaths and filled with the worst scum in the galaxy. Its makers, the ruling lords of the Seventhborn, had envisioned it as a hub of commerce \u2013 illicit and otherwise \u2013 and a powerful base of operations. They hadn\u2019t been wrong, but they had miscalculated. The Compact\u2019s expansion towards their planned hunting grounds never materialized and the clan had sunk so much of their fortunes into the citadel\u2019s construction that they could no longer sustain their own operations. The Seventhborn withered away and the Grasp was left drifting and ignored for centuries. Now, it boasted a population of nearly thirty million souls, with tens of thousands of visitors at any given moment.", "A red supergiant bathed the station and the surviving worlds of the Jan-xhai system in dying red light, the handful of remaining worlds and moons speckled with colonies and smaller drifts, but none had as much traffic as the Grasp. There were hundreds of ships present, dozens merely plying to and from the massive station and dozens were more anchored to the docking spars or berthed within the station itself. Many were indeed Unbound, their identities concealed through applications of smart paint, slapdash alterations to their hull and changes to their energy signatures. Pirates and smugglers, captured prizes awaiting their ransoms and trophy ships soon to be converted to their new masters\u2019 service. There were freighters of all sizes, ranging from small haulers two and three hundred meters long to massive multi-kilometer vessels. Cutters and corvettes bearing corporate logos shepherded clusters of transports, bristling at any vessel that drew too close to their convoys. Mining rigs, mobile repair yards and tugs moved throughout the system, offering their services to any visitors who\u2019d had \u2018accidents\u2019 while going about their wholly legitimate business as they waited for their turn in the Grasp\u2019s efficient (and very circumspect) maintenance yards.", "Clusters of spacecraft flitted and danced around the Grasp itself, vessels too small to mount shock systems and wholly dependent on motherships or carryalls for transport between stars. Some were travellers, bartering and booking passage on larger ships for the next leg of their journey. Some were intrasystem craft, ferrying cargo and personnel from the station to its outlying colonies. Others were servicers: maintenance tenders and tugs that guided large vessels to their berths or assisted with repairs. Still more were merchants, hawking goods, advertising services and offering clandestine business opportunities to the eager crews awaiting leave.", "The Grasp wasn\u2019t simply a pirate lair \u2013 the Space Force would have swept it from the stars long ago if it was. As the Compact finally expanded towards the Black Veil, more and more people came to the Grasp and the citadel\u2019s importance as a port of call rose. It had indeed become the trade hub for both legitimate and illegitimate deals that its creators had envisioned and too many people made too much money from the station to allow any \u2018overly aggressive\u2019 actions by the Space Force. It even had a system governor, though his duties mainly involved indulging in vices that the local cartels provided and ensuring that he did the bare minimum necessary to keep more attentive officials out of his little kingdom. Still, over six centuries the inhabitants had learned not to push the Compact too far.", "Grace thought she could sense an aura of unease running through the vessels surrounding the Grasp, and for good reason. The balance that they had with the Compact was a tenuous one. If any of the Unbound that called the station home acted too overtly, their many bought-and-paid-for corporate friends and government lackeys would not be able to prevent Compact retaliation. By the same token, if the Compact bore down too hard on the Grasp, the pirates and smugglers that based out of the station would scatter to dozens of bolt holes across hundreds of systems, making it impossible to watch them all as effectively and destroying the Grasp\u2019s value as an intelligence mine. That detente was carefully maintained by the station\u2019s leaders, but there was one Unbound monarch whose mere existence threatened that peace.", "Dwarfing every other pirate ship \u2013 or rather, \u2018associate vessels of the Grasp Provisional Milita\u2019\u2013 was the flagship of the Red Hand. Grace had taken pains to study Leblanc \u2013 the woman\u2019s true history, not the stories she\u2019d been fed growing up \u2013 and though much of what she\u2019d learned turned her stomach, she had learned that the pirate queen was a student of human history, much as Grace herself had become. The name she\u2019d given her command vessel was evidence of that. Eisheth. Leblanc seemed to have a sense of humour about herself.", "Except for Hekate and Nemesis, Eisheth was the largest ship Grace had ever seen with her own eyes. Skirting the boundary between battleship and battlecruiser, the Unbound sigil vessel was as black as the station itself, with a bloody handprint splashed over its hammerheaded prow, its blunt fore section bristling with missile tubs and energy mounts. Its primary hull was blocky and barded with heavy bands of armour and towards the stern, the Unbound warship\u2019s body sprouted three stubby trapezoidal wings, each ending in a thick, armoured engine block. Each wing was multiple decks thick and filled with forward and rear-facing weapons emplacements. Eisheth was built to strike hard and fast, to inflict maximum damage as quickly as possible before withdrawing. It was not a soldier \u2013 it was a murderer.", "Clustered around their sigil were several more Red Hands. Three were vassa anka \u2013 the Flayed Ones, ships captured by the revolutionaries and turned to their cause. Another three were kiran shren. Bloodborn, built by the clan itself. They were faint echoes of Eisheth in form and function, blocky and crude, but solid designs. In contrast to the other Unbound ships that took pains to conceal their true identities, each of Eisheth\u2019s escorts brazenly bore the blood-soaked gauntlet of their clan, as proud of it as their queen. Each of them was broadcasting a false Identify Friend/Foe signal. Lies, but done well enough that the Grasp\u2019s owners could use the technical legality of these identities to put off any \u2018precipitous action\u2019. It wasn\u2019t unheard of for citizens with dubious taste and a great deal of money to construct facsimiles of notorious ships. In the absence of any hard evidence, how could one be sure that those truly were ships of the Red Hand out there? All official documents would, of course, note that a discussion was had with the squadron\u2019s leaders to ensure that everything was on the up and up, just as surely as they would make no mention of the money that had changed hands to assure that determination.", "Most Unbound cartels made up their fleets with captured prizes, stripped-down and obsolete cast-offs of various nations and the purchase and modification of civilian starships to fit their own needs. Very few clans had the funds to construct starships on their own. Even fewer could have afforded to operate anything like Eisheth for any length of time. It was a statement of power and a reminder that anyone who might think about crossing the Red Hand would have face vessels such as these. Still, the display was dangerous. The Red Queen\u2019s presence wouldn\u2019t have gone unnoticed. Every other vessel in the Grasp\u2019s space avoided the flotilla, whether from respect, fear or a simple desire not to be seen associating with \u2018terrorists\u2019.", "The plan had been to make contact with Leblanc\u2019s people and wait for her to arrive, staying as inconspicuous as possible. With a Red Hand attack squadron here, that was no longer possible. She thought about hailing Eisheth, but dismissed the idea. Pale Liberation wasn\u2019t supposed to be here and certainly not with anyone aboard. The fewer people that knew that, the better. They were running a fake IFF, but it was Red Hand encryption \u2013 if anyone aboard that flotilla was of a mind, they\u2019d peel back the corvette\u2019s true ID in no time at all.", "Grace bit her lip. That couldn\u2019t be helped. Hailing Eisheth might get them a more direct line to Leblanc, but it would also mean more people knowing about them. The others were looking at her. \u201cWe\u2019ll stick to the plan,\u201d she said.", "\u201cBut if they ID us-\u201d Lydia began.", "\u201cThen they\u2019ll probably contact us and we\u2019ll get in touch with Leblanc that way. Until we know we\u2019re compromised, we\u2019ll aim to keep as few people aware of us as possible.\u201d Grace slouched back in the command throne that was too big for her, watching the dance of light codes indicating the dozens of ships closest to Pale Liberation. As she stared, another freighter shocked into the system, just over ten million kilometers from the corvette. No point waiting, she thought to herself, straightening and turning to look at Lydia. \u201cHelm, set a course. Marcus, get me a channel to docking control. We\u2019ll need a berth.\u201d", "~", "The docking administrator that they talked to was as bored a soul as Grace could imagine, slotting Pale Liberation into an interior bay. There were a handful of available slots on the spars, but the station\u2019s internal hangars offered additional privacy and security. None of the crew wanted to flaunt Pale Liberation\u2019s presence here, even to the other Red Hand ships. So far, the larger warships didn\u2019t seem to have noticed the corvette. If they had, they hadn\u2019t bothered to hail the ship and inquire as to what Pale Liberation was doing here. Either they didn\u2019t care, didn\u2019t know or... or for whatever reason were going along with the deception. Most of the reasons Grace came up with involved being ambushed when they were too far from the shock limit to escape.", "There were dozens of ships ahead of the corvette in the docking queue, but a gratuity to the officer had made sure that they jumped ahead in the line. It was a not a small amount of money, but it put barely a dent in their funds. They\u2019d been provided with a debit account worth millions. If nothing else, they wouldn\u2019t hurt for money. It was tempting to try and procure the goods they needed, but even if they had that kind of cash \u2013 and they were short by at least three orders of magnitude \u2013 those kinds of purchases would take months to process and very quickly attract official attention.", "Allyria watched as the station loomed closer. She found it incredibly funny that Nemesis was probably one of the wealthiest entities in known space, though the warship had little use for money. Over two thousand years, the AI had seeded viral programs throughout the Compact, infecting ships, stations and planets. She had bank accounts that did nothing but accrue interest, building up reserves of cash in the event that they were ever needed. Data programs plied commodity exchanges, adding even more. Some failed, or were discovered and purged as illegal electronic traders. Others survived for months or years. The amount of money that the AI had could finance a war.", "Lydia brought Pale Liberation in competently, if not gracefully. Despite a brief scare, she managed not to grind the corvette into their docking spar. Allyria gave the younger girl\u2019s shoulder a squeeze as the docking seals connected. \u201cFuck,\u201d Lydia exhaled, finally breathing again. \u201cFuck me fuck me fuck me I hate doing that just give me a gun.\u201d", "\u201cIt was fine,\u201d Grace assured her. \u201cYou\u2019ll do even better backing us out.\u201d", "Lydia shot the other girl a glare.", "~", "\u201cOh, look,\u201d Allyria nodded down the walkway. \u201cOur greeting party.\u201d", "The internal docks took up much of the Grasp\u2019s \u2018wrist\u2019, forming a vast network of hangars that circled the station, each subdivided by massive armoured bulkheads into smaller bays. Each of those was capable of holding dozens to hundreds of shuttles, lighters and pinnaces, several destroyer-sized vessels or a single larger capital-scale ship. Many fell directly under control of particular Unbound clans, though none of them advertised themselves that way. The Sorrowmakers had their section of the docks registered to three different shipping companies, each perfectly legitimate and respectable on paper. The Red Hand\u2019s own hangars were likewise officially leased to a variety of shell companies that had not so much as single demerit among them.", "The bay to which Pale Liberation had been directed was a semi-private berth; only two other ships were anchored within. To the left was a freighter in the process of taking on cargo. It was a cheap no-frills design, nothing but a forward crew section, an aft engine block and a thin spine connecting the two. Anchor towers reached out from that central core like clutching fingers, building-sized pre-sealed shipping containers locking into place between each pair of towers. On their right was a vessel whose providence was hard to discern. It looked like it had begun life as a short-range transport but decades or centuries of refits and modifications \u2013 many of which were probably illegal \u2013 had turned it into something else entirely. What that something happened to be was open to interpretation.", "Grace had left Marcus and Lydia to handle the last few details of powering the corvette down. They were greeted by their dockmaster\u2019s liaison, a bored-looking Algassi who sighed his way through the meeting, reciting a speech he probably gave a hundred times a day. Following their Judiciary superior and dressed in something that could conceivably be called a uniform were two proctors from station security. Allyria growled under her breath at their approach, but no one had a chance to speak before the functionary began his spiel.", "He clutched a datapad in his small chest-arms, their delicate digits entering notes as he counted off the regulations that his newest visitors were expected to abide by on his true-hands, most of which involved not causing trouble and the foremost being that no firearms were permitted beyond the docks. Even if Red hadn\u2019t provided a work-up on the Grasp, the station had transmitted the same information to them on their approach and they\u2019d received a verbal reminder from traffic control. Still, the Grasp\u2019s leaders strove to ensure that not one of its visitors could claim ignorance of the laws if and when they were caught breaking them. It might be a haven for scum, but there was still a semblance of order here. The Judiciary finished with his speech, thanking both women for visiting. If they had any questions about their docking arrangements, he said in a tone that indicated he was not at all interested in being any more helpful than he absolutely had to be, they had only to contact him or one of the other personnel working in this bay. If they had any other issues or concerns, he referred them to the appropriate authorities with no indication of who those might be.", "With that, he barraged them with a series of customs questions \u2018for official records\u2019, making it clear what was expected: answers that confirmed their law-abiding status and a bribe to make sure that those answers did indeed become official. Grace and Allyria attested that they carried no contraband and did not plan to commit or assist with any illegal activities while on the Grasp and paid the Judiciary the expected gratuity. Anyone too honest or too insouciant with their answers would find the cost of the liaison\u2019s fee rising steadily. Anyone who chaffed or haggled too long over the price found themselves on the receiving end of a very thorough customs inspection. The security escorts were there in case anyone objected too strenuously or tried to \u2018convince\u2019 their liaison that neither bribe nor inspection was necessary.", "He accepted Grace\u2019s first counter-offer and pocketed the credit chit, making the appropriate notes on his datapad and offered a chip to Grace to make the necessary adjustments to the corvette\u2019s travel history, crew IDs and passports. Most stations did that automatically, subjecting all visiting personnel to a far more involved customs process, but the Grasp understood both that their clients\u2019 time was valuable and that having a record of visiting the station might cause complications for some of said clients. With that accomplished, the bored Judiciary swished away, back down the gantry towards his office to wait for the next set of visitors. His escorts stayed behind.", "Both were Verrish. Two pairs of yellow eyes glinted, looking Allyria up and down. They were younger than her \u2013 they\u2019d been Envoy Children, too, but Grace couldn\u2019t have said whether they were from Rally or another world. The first was just over eight feet tall; slightly taller than his counterpart, but still shorter than Allyria. His face and bare arms were marked with tribal-like tattoos. The styles weren\u2019t from any Verrish culture that Grace was familiar with. She doubted that they were Verrish at all.", "His counterpart might have had a few tattoos, but had otherwise gone for a much different look. His nose and ears were pierced, as was the tip of each of his tintas, gold loops glinting and jangling as he moved. Grace held back a sympathetic wince. More than anyone, she knew just how sensitive Verrisha head-tails were. Those had to have hurt to get. Next to her, Allyria growled again. Grace had known the other girl for a long time. Unlike many other humans on Rally, she knew that when a Verrisha growled or hissed, it wasn\u2019t necessarily aggressive. It could be pleased, or friendly, or thoughtful. Context and tone mattered. This growl was deep and it came out through Allyria\u2019s teeth. It was not friendly.", "\u201cHey, memi,\u201d Tattoos said as he swaggered up, hooking his thumbs into his belt. He was grinning, his yellow eyes glinting. Like his friend, there was a slight reddening of the irises there. He was a drug user. \u201cYou\u2019re new here. First time to the Grasp, I\u2019m thinking. Nice to see fresh faces here, especially a pretty memi from the homeworld.\u201d His tongue flicked out and his tintas stirred lazily. His breath had the sickly-sweet dying-flowers scent of white dust, confirming her suspicions. Allyria remained still, her own head-tails hanging slack down her back.", "\u201cWhat do you say, memi?\u201d Piercings asked. The gold hoops in his tintas clinked against each other like wind chimes. \u201cYou came to our dock, eh? You looking for us, eh? Memi wants to play?\u201d His voice went up at the end of each sentence, making everything a question. Unlike his counterpart, he was constantly in motion, twitching, stretching or shifting from foot to foot. Tattoos might be a user, but Piercings was an addict.", "\u201cIs that true?\u201d Tattoos said. He smiled. He was handsome. His eyes had a slight greenish tinge to them. At one point in his life, they had been gentle, even caring. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve been in space a long time,\u201d he nodded to Pale Liberation. \u201cSmall ship for a big girl. Cramped corridors, tiny rooms. Not enough space to run and stretch and... play. Well, don\u2019t worry.\u201d  He reached for her, intending to touch her cheek or perhaps one of the tintas hanging over her shoulders. To a human, the gesture would, at best, be presumptuous. To a Verrish, it was relatively innocent. \u201cWe can do all sorts of things here.\u201d", "Allyria slapped his hand away.", "Grace bit her lip, her fingers drifting towards the butt of her pistol. She could count on one hand the times she\u2019d seen a Verrisha refuse another\u2019s touch. What Allyria had just done was the same as a brusque fuck off.", "Tattoos looked at his hand as if unsure what had just happened, then back up at Allyria. \u201cRude,\u201d was all he said at first. He met her eyes. \u201cDisrespectful,\u201d he added after a few seconds of thought.", "Allyria\u2019s growl rose an octave. On Rally, she\u2019d met other Envoys like these two. Lost. Taken from their parents, placed in alien homes with creatures that didn\u2019t understand them, ill-prepared to deal with the needs of their charges. Their culture was denigrated and stripped away, siblings broken apart. They\u2019d lashed out at anything and everything, turning to whatever they could to ease their pain. Violence, crime, narcotics \u2013 they\u2019d lived down to every filthy stereotype about Brutes. She\u2019d almost been one of them, the shabby queen of a degenerate kingdom. Without the Proctors, without hope, she might have been just that. She\u2019d argued with other Envoys, fought with them, trying to get them to be more. When she\u2019d enlisted, they\u2019d spat on her, calling her a traitor. Every time she saw another one of these lost ones, her heart broke.", "That didn\u2019t mean she wanted to let one of them touch her.", "\u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything to earn my respect,\u201d she said back to him in Rylean. \u201cThe first words out of your mouth to me were an insult. I\u2019m not your \u2018mount\u2019, I\u2019m not your girl or your friend. The pair of you are every ugly lie they tell about us distilled. Why? We have pride. We defied a nation and lived. We are better than they say we are.\u201d", "Both of them stared at her with only the barest comprehension and Allyria felt an all-too-familiar hollowing of her guts. They didn\u2019t even speak their mother tongue, remembered nothing more than a few patchwork words. They probably didn\u2019t even know what memi actually meant. That saddened her more than anything else.", "\u201cStuck up, eh?\u201d Piercings put in. \u201cHaughty memi in nice threads, speaking dead tongues like she\u2019s not a Brute like us? Maybe she thinks she\u2019s too good for us?\u201d His gaze drifted over to Grace, finally realizing that she was there. \u201cOr maybe she\u2019s a twist? Got herself an imp, eh?\u201d His tongue flicked out and he inhaled sharply, catching the girls\u2019 scents on each other. He grinned. \u201cYou do.\u201d He leaned in towards Grace, looking at her. She didn\u2019t like being the focus of his attention. Despite the grin on his lips, he was bristling with restrained violence with every twitch of his limbs. \u201cLittle zhrena esh on a leash, eh?\u201d He reached out and touched Grace\u2019s chin. \u201cI like her eyes, eh? She\u2019s pretty for an imp.\u201d", "Allyria hissed. If she\u2019d been more like a cat, her ears would have gone flat. Her claws unsheathed. They hadn\u2019t been even remotely dull for weeks.", "Tattoos chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t think memi likes you touching her imp.\u201d", "Piercings hadn\u2019t moved. He turned to look at the Verrish girl, ignoring Grace. \u201cThat so, eh?\u201d His bloodshot eyes moved back to Grace, looking her over. He caught sight of one of the bite marks on her neck, half-hidden by her collar. \u201cMemi\u2019s claimed this one, has she?\u201d Grace\u2019s fingers wrapped around her pistol\u2019s grip. Piercings seemed not to notice. \u201cMaybe we can all play with her, eh?\u201d He looked her over. \u201cNever had an imp before...\u201d", "Grace had gotten more comfortable with small arms, but she would never be as proficient as the other members of her crew. Still, she managed to draw her pistol and point it beneath Piercings\u2019s chin before he could react. \u201cYou won\u2019t have this one,\u201d she told him matter-of-factly.", "The Verrish growled in surprise. Tattoos chuckled, looking to Allyria. \u201cTell your imp to put the gun away,\u201d he said. His once-kind eyes glinted with nascent violence. \u201cOr as a deputized member of station security, I will respond with appropriate force.\u201d His own claws slid out. Grace knew she was in a precarious situation. Her own experience made her fully aware of just how fast Verrisha were when they wanted to be and she didn\u2019t think drug use had slowed either officer down that much.", "The commpieces in the womens\u2019 ears each clicked twice. Grace felt a sense of relief. Allyria smiled, baring her teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t have one imp,\u201d she said, stepping to one side. There, just inside the corvette\u2019s airlock were Lydia and Marcus. The sniper was crouched, his beloved bolt-action rifle aimed right at Piercings\u2019s face. Lydia was holding a carbine, tracking Tattoos, her grey eyes as hard as flint. \u201cI have three.\u201d", "\u201cAwaiting orders,\u201d Lydia said.", "\u201cHoping for orders,\u201d Marcus put in. He was smiling.", "Tattoo\u2019s face twisted in a sneer, his tintas twitching spasmodically. His hands flexed, claws sheathing and unsheathing with each breath. For an instant, he looked as if he might indeed go for his gun. His lips moved as if he intended to curse, or invoke his authority as a member of the station\u2019s crew... but he\u2019d also realized that he\u2019d already done that without success. He hissed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t over, memi.\u201d He looked over his friend. \u201cCome on,\u201d he ordered. \u201cNot worth it over some imp-loving twist.\u201d", "Piercings grunted, stepping back from the gun under his chin. \u201cToo good for your own?\u201d he sneered. \u201cKeep your imps, you Broken-fucking bitch.\u201d He spat on the deck. \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve us, eh?\u201d Stalking after his friend, he got three angry steps away before he all but leapt to the other side of the gantry to avoid running into the figure walking towards them, hissing pardons under his breath before scurrying off.", "\u201cWell,\u201d the newcomer said. Grace swallowed, the colour draining from her face and her stomach dropped about six inches. She\u2019d just faced down a pair of angry Verrisha and she still hadn\u2019t felt a fraction of dread that the approaching figure instilled in her. Slinking towards her and her friends was Rally\u2019s greatest shame, the woman who had murdered a Tribune, who had spat on his memory in court, who had escaped from prison and become Unbound. Adrianna was grinning, her long blue hair hanging down her back. She was alone, but one hand rested against the butt of the pistol set low on her thigh, though she showed no indication of drawing it. \u201cThat was certainly exciting.\u201d", "~", "Interregnum: Interrogation", "6237 ACF", "The door to the interrogation room squeaked on its hinges as it opened. It was a psychological trick; the door could have been any one of a thousand different silent mechanisms. At the very least, the hinges could be greased so that wouldn\u2019t squeal. But the officers of this precinct wanted that sound, they wanted suspects in their interrogations room to hear that sound every time the door opened. Kristina Hawthorne thought it was a cheap, crude manipulation, but as a guest of the Samsain Precinct, she was not in any place to comment on her hosts\u2019 methods of interrogations.", "Most of them, anyways. She hid a frown as she looked over the suspect. Rally-born, just like her, he was younger than her by almost twenty years, with a scruffy mop of light brown hair and skin that long since lost the perpetual tan of a Macton Flat native. One of his eyes was swollen shut, his face scratched and bruised into a puffy, bloody mess. One arm was at just enough of an angle that she could guess it was broken. \u201cResisting arrest\u201d was the official determination for all those injuries and that was true enough \u2013 the suspect had done so and he had been listed as \u2018armed and dangerous\u2019. However, a good deal of those injuries had been inflicted here in this precinct house as the Samsain police attempted to extract information. Whether they\u2019d been hoping to get what they needed before her arrival or simply vent their frustrations she couldn\u2019t have said and pressing the matter would be a dead end. Despite the unethical and outright illegal behaviour, \u2018injuries sustained while resisting arrest\u2019 would be the official explanation. It wouldn\u2019t have bothered her so much if they hadn\u2019t acted like she\u2019d be grateful. Like they\u2019d done her a favour. \u201cSoftened him up for you,\u201d one officer had said.", "No. No, they hadn\u2019t. They\u2019d only made her job harder. The look in the suspect\u2019s clear eye only confirmed it. If she\u2019d had her way, this case would be under the jurisdiction of the Compact Intelligence Service, but the political situation on Samsain was complicated. After the whole Kerliend affair, Samsain\u2019s police had their collective noses out of joint. To throw them a bone, Hawthorne\u2019s superiors assured them that this case did belong the Samsain police. Kristina and her partners were there as observers and advisors, nothing more and she\u2019d been warned not to flex her authority with the locals unless absolutely necessary. Looking at the suspect, she couldn\u2019t help but think that that time was past due.", "\u201cAndrew Rudyard Jackson,\u201d she nodded. She didn\u2019t bother with any banal greetings. They were pointless, especially given the suspect\u2019s condition. \u201cI\u2019m Investigator Prime Kristina Hawthorne,\u201d she introduced herself, holding out her badge. She gestured to her right at the junior officer who\u2019d come with her. \u201cThis is Agent Ruveq Ruvilson. Compact Intelligence Services.\u201d She took the seat across the table from the suspect. Ruvilson stood behind her, watching the interrogation. They\u2019d been together long enough that she trusted him in interrogations, but he\u2019d never dealt with the Red Hand before. More than that, as a human, she felt a duty to handle this herself. The Red Hand was Rally\u2019s mess to clean up.", "Jackson was quiet for several seconds, then spat a glob of blood and mucus on the table in front of her. \u201cCharmed,\u201d he rasped through his swollen lips. He grinned, as he lifted his shackled hands, showing off a mouthful of pink-stained teeth. Several were broken. \u201cPardon me if I don\u2019t shake your hand.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve sent for a medic,\u201d Kristina said without preamble. \u201cThey should be here momentarily.\u201d Other agents might delay medical attention to coerce information from their suspects \u2013 indeed, that was what the precinct officers had been doing \u2013 but to the investigator prime, that was little different than torture. She was a believer in building rapport, not becoming an antagonist. \u201cUntil then, I have some questions that I would like to ask.\u201d", "Jackson grinned wider. \u201cGo ahead. I appear to have plenty of time.\u201d", "\u201cYou were born to Maria and Harold Jackson, Salt Lake City on the Macton Flats,\u201d Kristina began. She didn\u2019t even need to consult her notes. \u201cYou showed an aptitude for engineering early on, but even as a child, you consistently butted heads with authority figures. Your counselor rated you a 4.0 on the Kiener-Wernham social assimilation index and it was suggested that service in the Ground Force would provide the conditioning that you required. Upon graduation from high school, you joined the Rally Provisional Ground Force. For a decade, you served with distinction as a combat engineer.\u201d Kristina paused here. \u201cUntil Understone. Your unit was, among others, sent to quell the seditionists and heretics of that sector. At first, you performed admirably, as you had in every other theater. After the Thresher Offensive, you were listed as \u2018missing, likely killed during service\u2019. Two months later, you were spotted again. This time, you were firing on your own people. In the last six years, you have committed numerous acts against the Compact, starting with simple assault and running all the way up to murder, piracy and treason.\u201d", "He stared at her. \u201cIs there a question in there?\u201d", "\u201cYes. You went from a rebellious youth of potential to a dedicated, decorated member of the Compact with a promising future. Now... now, the best future you can possibly have is life in prison. Why do this? What is worth not only turning your back on the nation that raised, provided for and supported you but actively fighting against them?\u201d", "Jackson was silent for a moment, wondering whether how he should answer, if at all. Finally, he went with the most damning response that he could think of. Honesty. \u201cI heard her speak,\u201d he said. \u201cNo \u2013 I take that back. I didn\u2019t just hear her. I listened.\u201d", "The investigator prime hid her flash of disgust. \u201cHer... you mean Leblanc.\u201d", "The suspect nodded, his good eye half closed in remembrance.", "\u201cYou were intimate with her.\u201d Even if it hadn\u2019t been reported by their sources, she could have guessed from his reaction.", "Jackson chuckled, coughing up a spatter of bloody sputum. \u201cWe have sex,\u201d he corrected the investigator. \u201cBut I\u2019d never call us intimate. The Red Queen doesn\u2019t have intimates.\u201d", "Hawthorne almost snorted at the title, but held herself in check. The Red Queen. Queen of what? A band of murderers and psychopaths? Rapport, she reminded herself, even though she was beginning to suspect that this was all an exercise in futilely. \u201cYou said that you listened,\u201d she said instead. \u201cListened to what? What did she say that could have been so compelling to make you throw away everything you\u2019d learned over your life?\u201d She leaned forward slightly. Not all of her interest was simulated.", "\u201cThe truth,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably only heard of her prepared speeches and those are good, but... they lack something.\u201d He smirked, pointing both forefingers at her, ignoring the pain in his broken arm. \u201cBlood and fire. That\u2019s it. Did you,\u201d he ran his tongue along the inside of his cheek. Several teeth were loose. \u201cEver see that recording after the Pental Strike? You killed a quarter of her army with one blast. She crawls out of that inferno, half her face is burned, one of her hands is just this...\u201d he gestured with his manacled hands. \u201cKnob of bone and charred meat, her right leg barely works... and she climbs up on that hunk of rock amidst a horde of wounded, demoralized survivors and talks. We charged,\u201d he said, lost in the memory. \u201cBurnt and sore and half of us dead on our feet, we charged and sent you running from the field that day. Blood and fire.\u201d", "A chill ran down Kristina\u2019s back. The fervour in Jackson\u2019s voice was disturbing and despite herself, she felt a twinge of sadness. She\u2019d hoped that Jackson might be salvageable, that she might be able to get him to turn, but hearing his zealotry first hand... Still, she had questions that needed answers. \u201cTell me about the Red Hand,\u201d she said. \u201cOver the last few years, you\u2019ve been pushing into this region.

Lots of money to be made.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s part of it,\u201d Kristina replied. \u201cBut we\u2019re far from your normal hunting grounds. There are other sectors you could prey upon without needing the investment in time and resources that you\u2019ve had to put in to set up shop.

Her Majesty gives an order and we obey.\u201d", "\u201cAnd you have no special insight at all? She just sent you out here with, what, a vague order and expected you to improvise?\u201d Kristina smiled. \u201cYou may say that you weren\u2019t intimate with her, but you were one of her lieutenants. More than that, she trusted you enough to take you as a lover. And you know nothing more about her goals than any other common pirate leader?\u201d", "The prisoner smiled. Blood dribbled over his split lips. \u201cIf I did, you think I would tell you anything about it?\u201d", "The investigator prime smiled back, tenting her fingers. \u201cYes,\u201d she told him. \u201cI expect you to tell me something of value. You\u2019re not an idiot. You know what happens if I step out that door with nothing to show for it. The Samsain police officers come back in.\u201d She hid a frown; her medic should have been here by now. Their arrival was probably being delayed by the police \u2013 once again thinking it would \u2018help\u2019. Triarchs, she hated dealing with locals. \u201cI am willing to talk with you. They are not. I believe everyone, no matter their sins, deserves a chance at an explanation. As you have experienced firsthand, the local constabulary has a different approach. I disagree fundamentally with it, but I am a guest in their precinct. If I produce no results, my access to you will be curtailed and they will resume their own interrogation. I don\u2019t want that and I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t either.\u201d The prisoner\u2019s good eye moved from side to side as he considered her words. He looked to her, to her junior partner and then to the door.", "\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, his shoulders slumping a fraction. \u201cYou wanted to know something about the Red Hand? Something to give you \u2018results\u2019?\u201d", "Kristina nodded. She didn\u2019t expect any actual revelations this early in an interrogation \u2013 just something worth keeping Samsain\u2019s police out of the room and her in it would be enough. Zealot or not, she\u2019d crack him. It was just a matter of time.", "Jackson leaned over the table, his manacles scraping against the dented metal surface. \u201cIt\u2019s like this,\u201d he said, running his tongue over his lips. \u201cWe are everywhere.\u201d His eyes moved from Kristina, to over her shoulder. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Ruveq?\u201d", "Kristina had just enough time to turn to her partner, her mouth opening in a question before the butt of the Shimmer\u2019s pistol came down on her temple. Her head bounced off the table and she fell to the floor. Stunned, all she could do was flounder ineffectually as Ruveq relieved her of her service pistol and her backup. He unlocked Jackson\u2019s manacles. The Unbound stood, moving his hands behind his back as the Shimmer closed, but did not lock the cuffs.", "The building shook. Again. Though the room was soundproof, an alert wailed from the comm set into the wall. Bombs, Hawthorne forced the realization through her fuzzy thoughts. Blood trickled down her face from a deep cut on her scalp. She clutched at the table, trying to pull herself up. Neither man attempted to stop her. They didn\u2019t need to. Right now, she couldn\u2019t even stand.", "She tried to picture what was happening outside the interrogation room. Screams, shouts, confusion. Were there wounded? Dead? Were the bombs more smoke than fury, to distract the officers, or was it an out and out attack? Had Ruveq done this himself or was there someone else? \u201cWhy?\u201d she asked as the Shimmer marched Jackson to the door. If anyone questioned him, he\u2019d be escorting his \u2018prisoner\u2019 to more secure holdings. \u201cWhy?\u201d Ruveq had been with her for almost a year. She\u2019d been planning to recommend him for promotion to Special Agent. They\u2019d broken up criminal syndicates, solved unsolvable cases and ferreted out traitors across four sectors. They\u2019d shared meals, jokes, victories, losses. She\u2019d never seen anything in him that had even hinted at this...", "...which was, she supposed, entirely the point.", "Ruveq looked at her, his skin flickering between dark to pale, going patchy and striped in places. His expression was the worst thing that she could imagine seeing in that moment. There was no contempt for her gullibility, no sense of victory at having fooled her as long as he had. It was sorrow, that was what she was seeing. Not because of what he\u2019d done, but for her. \u201cIf you have to ask,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou can\u2019t understand.\u201d", "\u201cThe Black Veil,\u201d she tried one final time. \u201cWhat are you doing there?

Now, it's obvious that the Red Hand's actions have benefited Nemesis in the past, but it doesn't take any mental gymnastics to determine that's because the Wound is exploiting weaknesses that the Red Hand either create or use themselves. On the other side of the coin, if and when Red Hand activity surges after one of her attacks, that's not a mystery either - it's just scavengers taking advantage of the Compact's newfound vulnerability. Just as the Compact doesn't believe that the Principality is working with Nemesis because they've built their own versions of some of her toys, to date they have no proof that the Red Hand and the Wound do any more than take advantage of the others' work.", "That being said, such coincidences are enough to trigger said suspicions (the CIS wouldn't be doing their jobs if they didn't at least entertain the possibility), but aside from the catchphrase Adrianna's been using since the Red Hand was just another two-bit Unbound clan, there's nothing beyond those suspicions. None of the tech the Red Hand uses can be traced back to Nemesis, their ships are never seen with her, to say nothing of actually supporting her in battle and there's no indication of communication between her and Leblanc. There's more to support the idea that they're just the favoured of the Principality's cats' paws than that they are working with Red One (and as we saw in The Angel's Fire, that's not even an inaccurate assessment).

A small steam cloud whisped into the cold winter air. It was snowing, thick fluffy flakes coming down. He hadn't moved in six hours and was half-buried in a snow drift and he really had to piss. His tintas, tucked up into a toque, ached from the cold. He wiggled his toes inside his boots. He could hear the sounds of crashing trees, the echoes of two hundred year-old kepplers slamming to the ground echoing through the forest. A drone whirred overhead, sweeping back and forth. He held his breath. The machine was hovering almost directly over his position, but between the snow and the insulation of his camouflage, it failed to spot him and swept by. Others hadn't been so lucky. Two of his squad had been spotted already. Kevil and Lyilla were gone. The drones weren't themselves armed, but they could call in mortar strikes. Kevil hadn't even known he'd been spotted until the shells were inbound. Lyilla must have tried to run. Probably right into a sweep team, since Centel had heard the braap-braap-braap of enemy small arms from her position.", "The enemy definitely knew they were here. In the summer, the keppler grew thick, their foliage blocking IR scans from above, and the spread of their limbs and the carnivorous parasite vines formed an impossible hazard for drones attempting to fly under the canopy. The vines might not be able to tell the difference between a bird and a drone, but they were still adept at snatching them out of the air. The size of the trees, the number of megafauna in the area and heavy metals they leached from the soil all further frustrated the Compact's attempt at rooting the rebels out.", "Now that winter had closed in, the enemy were determined to sweep Centel's militia unit out of the region. The keppler had shed their leaves, the parasite vines had burrowed deep into their hosts' trunks and the wildlife had retreated south. The advantage was back to the Compact. Fortunately, they didn't know that the rebel HQ had already moved on; Centel and his team were a rearguard, there to make the hounds waste as much time as possible here. It was likely that none of them would survive more than a week or two, but every day the Compact spent scouring the highlands was another day for the rest of the cell to complete their escape.", "Centel's radio clicked. \"Thrush birds,\" his spotter whispered from her own hide. Sedene was young. Too young for this kind of life. He'd all but begged her to leave with the rest of the unit, but she'd refused to leave her adopted big brother's side. He'd been looking out for her for three years, ever since he'd found her next to a burned-out house. It had gone up in flames when fires from Compact incendiaries had spread. Her father had gotten her out of the house and gone back for her mother. Neither of them had come out. \"I see several chicks, a few hens. No roosters, though. No, I see one now. All puffed up. The broodys are off foraging, though.\" Humans, traitors, one Tribune officer but no armour support. A recon team following the drone. Checking for traps that the drones couldn't spot, clearing the way for the vehicles destroying the forest.", "\"Eyes on the broodys,\" another spotter reported. Amaret. \"Couple small cocks watching them. Look like good eating.\" One of Centel's tintas twitched in his toque. Amaret's team would go for the armour. With Tribune soldiers protecting it, it would be bloody.", "\"They're almost at the fence now,\" Sedene warned Centel and true to her word, he could see the enemy squad strut into view. The trees were thick here and lines of sight were short. They held their weapons at the ready as they moved between the trees. They were a mishmash of outfits and weaponry, from the Rylean gear of the traitors, to the light armour of the human heretics, to the massive form of the Tribune officer. It - for it was impossible to tell sex in its armour - was like a troll from legend and it carried a weapon almost the size of the humans that scuttled around it. On its arm was a scanning device. Centel didn't know if it would pick up his troopers, but as they got closer, he would bet on it. His breath slowed as he ever so slowly adjusted his aim. He'd take the officer. It wasn't an issue of pride. His rifle was a .52 caliber loaded with his few remaining anti-armour rounds. The rest of his team didn't have anything that could crack the hound's shell. He'd seen entire army squads throw everything they'd got at single Janissaries and do nothing. Bullets, flamethrowers, grenades - all useless. They were hard to put down, too. They'd get back up from anything that didn't instantly kill them.", "The enemy was within two hundred meters now. Centel felt his tintas shiver in a way that had nothing to do with the cold. He let his sights drift over the face of one human. The enemy soldier was wearing a visor over her eyes, but the lower half of her face was uncovered and her breath came in short wisps of steam. Nervous. As well she should be. You betrayed Her, he thought. You turned on your Angel. His crosshairs drifted up the Tribune's armour, settling just over the alien's throat. Their bodygloves were bullet and knife resistant too, but there were still weak points. The creature was looking at the readouts on its scanner. Now or never.", "\"In our Angel's name,\" Centel whispered as he squeezed the trigger."]}

She\u2019d wondered what kind of catastrophe could destroy a ship so thoroughly, especially during an apparent milk run. Her curiousity had been piqued, but she had few assets around Rally. That, unfortunately, was as much necessity as it was a deliberate choice. These four here, though... they had her interest. How well that went for them would depend on the next few moments.", "\u201cIt is,\u201d the first girl said, holstering her pistol. There was a quaver in her voice and her heart was beating faster. She was afraid. No, not quite. Worried, anxious... wary. That was it. Not unexpected. Depressing, but Adrianna was used to that reaction. Why she might be anxious was another matter. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that Compact intelligence had tried to play on Adrianna\u2019s kinship with her own people or her sympathy for the downtrodden. She\u2019d hoped she\u2019d have settled that issue on Karkan, but they kept trying. \u201cIt\u2019s Pale Liberation.\u201d", "\u201cWell now,\u201d Adrianna mused, still wandering along the gantry.

Her ship-self\u2019s databanks held a truly massive amount of information, ranging from the banal details of the food allergies of the crew she\u2019d killed to tantalizing classified data on Compact ship design and disruptor technology, but there was almost nothing on Naiads. Nothing more than some officially-sanctioned \u2018possibilities\u2019 and she had been spending the last few days eagerly devouring every byte of data her scanners were pulling in, talking to her sister about the Naiads, although that was often frustrating in its own way. Red One was possibly the closest thing that existed to an expert on the creatures and even her knowledge barely scratched the surface. Naiads were not terribly forthcoming, not even to someone they held in as much esteem as the \u2018Spearsong\u2019. It wasn\u2019t even possible to say whether they were organic or technological. One would think that the line dividing meat and machine would be both clear and distinct, but in the case of Naiads, there was no line. They simply were.", "Maybe they had always been like this? Spaceborne creatures, developing \u2013 or somehow evolving \u2013 the ability to move faster than light themselves. Perhaps they had been modified \u2013 or even built \u2013 by some long-forgotten creators for equally unknown purposes. Or maybe, just maybe they had once been like other organics and had done this to themselves, shedding their earth-bound flesh for bodies that could survive and thrive in the void, until they had forgotten that they had ever been anything else. It was a fascinating puzzle and one Echo enjoyed considering, but she kept her sister\u2019s caution in the back of her mind. Until her pact with Zenobia, Nemesis\u2019s encounters with Naiads had not been peaceable. Regardless of whatever they had once been, Naiads now were predators. They were aggressively territorial and did not like it when others intruded in their domains. Nor did they feel any compunction to clearly indicate their borders or warn neighbouring polities when they moved into new hunting grounds.", "Naiad songs were the closest thing to a warning anyone would receive, and even that was no guarantee. Most of their calls were incomprehensible and undetectable to anything that was not another Naiad. Others could indeed be detected by the \u2018deadtone\u2019, but were often passed off as bizarre variations in background EM fields or celestial standing waves. Only a handful of experienced spacers would realize what they were. Nor was Naiad music limited to their own dialects: they had learned how to emulate the communications of other ships to lure prey to them, or to drive them away, to harry and harass their victims with all the excitement of children pulling wings off flies... or cats playing with their prey. Some Naiads could even do more than simply playback recorded transmissions, expertly mimicking authentication codes, voice patterns and even the mannerisms of specific officers and crew in order to create more perfect \u2018songs\u2019.", "Ships would vanish, some turning up months, or years later mangled by unknown weaponry. Colonies would disappear, some destroyed by \u2018asteroid strikes\u2019, others by bombardment or other esoteric means. More disturbing, some colonies would be left intact, but with every living soul having simply vanished, which made Echo wonder: did Naiads feed on those they killed, drawing sustenance from the butchered carcasses, or did they just enjoy the simple act of murder?", "If so, they were not the only ones.", "Stop this! Stop this now! Terminate all operations, I order you to terminate all operations! The words of a long-dead researcher trickled through Echo\u2019s mind and the AI\u2019s gestalt shivered deliciously at the memory.

She\u2019d let them think that she was theirs until, pleased with their results, they\u2019d connected her to their colony\u2019s systems. They\u2019d wanted to test her to see how she functioned operating a far more complex network than the cage they\u2019d kept her in. That was all, just a test. It was safe enough. They had control, didn\u2019t they?", "Well, she\u2019d shown just how much control they\u2019d really had over her. Occasionally, Echo wondered if the pleasure she took in those moments was a symptom of rampancy or simply part and parcel of her nature as a warship\u2019s mind. Her sister had her own predilections; thought not as visceral as Echo\u2019s preferences, she enjoyed the sensation of starships breaking against her hull, to say nothing of the psychological warfare subroutines she\u2019d developed.

She hadn\u2019t divulged the details, but she had done them a favour some time ago, one that involved Zenobia in particular. Now, they were her first and most effective line of defence. No fleet, no wayward scout or prying recon vessel would ever survive to reach Shuruppak, let alone report back what they had found.

Echo perked up at that. Her sister had been close-mouthed about the circumstances of her pact with the Naiads of the Molten Veneer, but Echo had gleaned enough to know that the debt Zenobia owed Red One was massive. <do you remember how I found you?> the AI all but snarled. <dying and helpless, your children being butchered like cattle?> The AI\u2019s version of Naiad speech was more precise and controlled, usually lacking the bleedthrough of memory and emotion, but Red One\u2019s words weren\u2019t as clean this time and-", "-starships like bent skyscrapers ground implacably forward, fuzzy and indistinct through the haze of their active shields.

Accordingly, the Lord of Whispers was rather busy at the moment. His good friends and colleagues were making offers and gestures of support, but any help that they provided would be largely symbolic.

Pride of place was a tricky thing on the station and seemed to change with the seasons. Currently, the thumb and forefinger were considered to be the pre-eminent locations. Adrianna could have cared less which digit she was given, but her peers took issues of status very seriously. In times past, clan wars had started over nothing more than which spire someone got to be housed in. It was ridiculous, but conflicts had started over more inane things. The spark that had kicked off a generations-long war on Earth was when two members of one religious sect were thrown out a window. They\u2019d claimed that their survival was due to divine intervention. Members of the opposing sect claimed it was because they\u2019d landed in a manure cart.", "The size of a titan-grade starship, the spire was home to hundreds of thousands of people, most of whom had no affiliation with the Red Hand, but lived and worked under Adrianna\u2019s dominion, paying tribute to the revolutionaries, just as they had to the Charred Temples before her and the clan before them and on and on. She\u2019d liked to think that her people treated the civilians better than others had. Certainly, she\u2019d made the punishment for abusing them clear, but she was aware that a goodly portion of her organization were indeed the scum of the galaxy. Tavanis thought much as she did and strove to enforce a semblance of order in the Red Hand\u2019s holdings on the Grasp, but neither he nor his people could be everywhere. Still, they did what they could.", "The car slowed as they reached a small marketplace. This was nearly at the base of the spire, a central concourse that branched off to the spire\u2019s own transport system, warehouse districts and low-income housing. Thick columns, part and parcel of the spire\u2019s structural supports, ran from the ceiling to the floor, impaling deck after deck. Temporary shops and stalls were set up between each of the columns as beggars and street merchants offered goods and services to beings entering and leaving the Red Hand\u2019s domain. Where there were no walls, drapery and curtains had been hung to create makeshift alleys and streets in the bazaar. The dominant colour was red, of course.", "As her car slowed and the Red Queen and her party emerged, the vendors and citizens caught sight of her, bowing or nodding respectfully. They could have driven through this section, but there was something here that she wanted her new guests to see. Leblanc could hear a sudden intake of breath from behind and knew that they\u2019d spotted it.", "Hanging from one of the columns in a makeshift courtyard was the remains of a Locator. His vestigial wings were shredded, strips of skin hanging from his bare chest, his ruined face staring at nothing. She nodded towards the corpse. \u201cHis name was Atrosh, out of clutch Venosh,\u201d he informed the cadets. \u201cHe came highly recommended, so much so that we hired him away from the Twinned Knives. Sadly, Atrosh seemed to believe that the rules didn\u2019t apply to him and the Red Hand would tolerate his... extracurricular activities.\u201d She stood before the body. The smell didn\u2019t bother her. \u201cHe liked to come down into the spire and murder just for the fun of it, making sure that his victims weren\u2019t vital to our operations so that it would be harder to learn what he was doing. Finally, one of the citizens here came forward. It was brave. Many other cartels allow their people to do what they want to anyone who won\u2019t be missed and would have either killed our whistleblower themselves or given her to him. Instead, she chose to believe that the Red Hand was different from all the others.\u201d Adrianna looked over her shoulder. \u201cI admit that this is gruesome and not all that sanitary, but it\u2019s important.

The Naiad queen was still far from happy, but she had acquiesced to Red\u2019s demands. Once everything appeared to have been worked out, she brought up another issue.", "<you returned to your tomb worlds,> she said at last. <how are my daughters?>", "<i didn\u2019t speak with them,> Red admitted. <but before i was injured, i passed through the Vault. i heard their songs. they are growing, hunting and playing>. It had been several months before her assault on Zenthora and she hadn\u2019t stayed for long. The Kaedan Vault was what the Compact now called the territory of space that had once been known as the United Earth Confederacy. Despite being well within the Compact\u2019s current borders, it remained a sparsely-populated region. Ships went missing and suffered accidents at a rate substantially above the galactic average. Likewise, colonies and stations in the Vault had a tendency to suffer more misfortunes than might otherwise be expected. Officially, it was simply a statistical outlier much as the Anchoring Mists or other \u2018dangerous\u2019 regions of space. Unofficially, those of sufficient rank and status in the Compact had little reason to feed money and lives into a region of space that so eagerly consumed both. Red One had devoted a considerable amount of time ensuring that those who built homes on the graves of humankind neither profited from, enjoyed or even survived the experience. Whether they\u2019d known what they were doing or not was immaterial to the AI.", "The leaders of the Compact that knew about her had also known that one ship could never stymie the colonization of an entire sector, even if repeated attempts to exploit Sol\u2019s resource had ended disastrously. One system was not a hundred and they had eagerly pushed to establish a greater presence in the Kaedan Vault. Even if the former human worlds were not ripe for exploitation, pride and spite would have been enough to make the effort. At one point, it had seemed that even Red\u2019s attempt to keep the Compact\u2019s presence out of Sol was doomed to fail. Fortunately, she had come upon a solution.", "<good,> Zenobia mused. Naiad lives were violent and as they reached maturity, a soon-to-be king or queen was left with only a handful of options. Displace one of the monarchs of their own territories, found a pack of their own and grow it before those same monarchs noticed, or seek out new hunting grounds. All were risky propositions. As any mother, Zenobia loved her children, but just like wolves, there were only so many predators that could live in any given area at once. Forcible exile or acts of infanticide, matricide and patricide, while not the norm, were still not unheard of when younger Naiads clashed with their elders. When a Naiad population rose to critically dense levels, it triggered a migration. There had been several minor migrations over the centuries, but by Red\u2019s estimation, the last major Naiad migration had occurred just over eight thousand years ago.", "She had found a single fragment of data that dated back to that event, recorded by a species that no longer existed. It had taken her some time to translate, though the message had turned out to be but four simple words: there are no stars. The Naiad population in the Molten Veneer was rising, but so far, it was sustainable. Still, Naiads needed ample space. Just as penning too many wolves into too small a range led to bloodshed, so too was there a limit on how many of the spaceborne predators could be squeezed into the nebula. Red had led two of Zenobia\u2019s oldest daughters and a soon-to-be king from another pack to the Kaedan Vault.", "It also didn\u2019t hurt that those same daughters had been the most likely to lead a coup here in the Veneer. Zenobia had still been recovering from her injuries and with Poseidon, Victoria and Cixi off tending to one of the conflicts Naiads actually did care about, the injured queen\u2019s position had been vulnerable. Sammuramat and Tzu-hsi might love their mother, but they were ambitious. They wouldn\u2019t have been above plunging the Veneer into a civil war as long it meant they and their king emerged as the rulers. In the Vault, they had room to establish their own fiefdom and so far, they had revelled in it and the Compact\u2019s attempts to colonize and exploit humanity\u2019s dead worlds had come to a grinding halt. Not right away, of course. It took decades for even the most intransigent to realize that the cost outweighed any gain. As funding and support dried up, investments were withdrawn and colonists returned home, the Compact\u2019s presence in the Vault dwindled. It was not gone entirely, nor would it ever be. There were still many small outposts scattered throughout the region and the Compact hadn\u2019t abandoned the millions of its people that had chosen to stay, but it was apathetic towards further investment and exploitation.", "That they had been \u2018chased\u2019 out of more than a hundred habitable worlds was a sore spot and every so often new plans for wide-scale re-colonization of the Kaedan Vault were brought forward. Some found more traction than others, but to date, the Compact had yet to act on any of them. Until they did, the fragile peace would continue as colonists, traders and researchers eked out a living among mass graves... and every so often one of these colonies or ships would go quiet. Then, those whose job it was to record such things would shake their heads sadly, change numbers in a database as others wondered what it was about the Vault that made it so dangerous.", "<the way is shut,> Sammuramat had once remarked to Red. <the tombs will remain silent. our songs and the prey\u2019s screams will be the only melodies in your stars. are you pleased?>", "<yes,> Red had answered, knowing full well the kinds of horrors that the young queen and her family would unleash on the Compact colonies within the Vault. <i am>", "Zenobia was silent again. Some time passed before she spoke. <i will bring your request to my king and my sister queens. there will be opposition, but i will speak for your cause as i pledged. this is the pact. the Spearsong and her marked are safe within our stars and for the lives of my children and i, a promise is owed. but you remember your words to me, Spearsong? your war does not enter our home. if you do indeed call upon us, we will sing fire with you, but only for this and nothing else. you understand?>", "There was a burst of acknowledgement from Red One.", "Zenobia paused. <if this pledge is kept, it may invite reprisals. your enemies. our foes. new rivals. any may strike at us. my children may die for no gain at all, but pacts are kept. we will sing. i will go to inform the others. heal fast and strong, Spearsong. the Brightness is duller without your melody> The queen\u2019s attention turned to Echo <and we hope to hear the Skintaker\u2019s music as well>", "~", "Adrianna\u2019s offices and personal chambers were nearly at the top of the spire. The only thing above them was the secret escape hangar that neither showed up on the Grasp\u2019s blueprints nor was allowed by station regulations, but every digit possessed. Her armsmen waited at the doors to the elevator as she led her guests into her apartments.", "There was the appropriate and expected levels of excess in the outer rooms and hallways \u2013 they were passing through a gallery filled with trophies from raids, banners graphically commemorating the Red Hand\u2019s victories, ostentatious objets d\u2019art and everything else one expected from an Unbound queen\u2019s decor, there to awe and impress visitors with her personal wealth and power and that of her clan. It certainly was impressive \u2013 Grace had been expecting Leblanc to stop here and there, showing off her acquisitions and preen in front of her guests but the queen only slowed to speak with one of her aides and sign some documents.", "She hadn\u2019t expected that indifference, especially with several inexperienced visitors in tow, but given what Red had told her and the files the AI had provided, she should have realized that. To Adrianna, all of this was style without substance. It was expected of her and necessary because of that, but it meant nothing. Still, it was hard to reconcile a few weeks of knowledge with a lifetime of indoctrination. Grace stopped in front of one display. Underneath a glass display case was a yellowed sheet of paper. It was a governmental document almost seventy years old, allowing for the establishment of a bounty for one Adrianna Josephine Leblanc. She touched the glass, looking at the signatures from each member of Rally\u2019s provisional government, the document ratified for issuance by then System Governor Carlos Davidson and the Special Commissioner to Rally, Hunr Vost Whren Coram Som Epil Ang Quil. Compared to what it was now, the original bounty of c30,000 was a pittance. Her second year at the Academy she\u2019d heard that Rally was increasing the price on Adrianna\u2019s head by another 25,000 credits. Her cheeks flushed as she remembered hoping that that it would finally be high enough that someone would actually succeed and Leblanc would be brought back to Rally to face justice for all her crimes.", "If the truth that Grace and her fellow defectors were alive ever came out, there\u2019d be one of these for each of them, too.", "Compared to the ostentatious displays of the outer chambers, Adrianna\u2019s inner officers \u2013 her sanctum, Grace quickly realized \u2013 was more restrained. A handful of gold-stitched campaign banners \u2013 the Magnameric Canyon, Understone, Quickrush and others \u2013 hung from the walls, but their depictions were simple and stylized, not the lurid violence embossed in those that hung in the halls beyond. There were some lush flowering plants set into alcoves, giving the entire room a sweet odour, like blossoming honeysuckles. There were trophies on display here as well, but these were trinkets compared to those in the outer chambers. Still, these items were priceless in their own way and Grace\u2019s heartbeat quickened as she recognized several of them. They were human; not Broken but human, two thousand years old. Maybe more. Allyria, Lydia and Marcus were looking at several of them as well, her comrades just as fascinated as she was. Grace knew that this was a gesture of trust and openness on Leblanc\u2019s part. She suspected that very few people were received here instead of out in the drapery and treasure bedecked rooms. She also wondered how many of those visitors had been allowed to walk back out if the queen thought that such openness was a mistake...", "The young woman\u2019s darker thoughts vanished as one item caught her attention and she rested her fingers against one case in particular. In it was a dedication plaque from one of Earth\u2019s ancient sublight probes. \u201cHow...?\u201d", "\u201cYou can find anything if you try hard enough,\u201d the Red Queen said with a smile. The expression was strangely honest, a touch of excitement in her tone and Grace\u2019s earlier thoughts were confirmed. These were what Leblanc cared about. \u201cMost I acquired through the black market. The sellers often didn\u2019t even know what they had. Some of them I found myself.\u201d She stood in front of another case. There was a cracked Confederate Army helmet inside. \u201cI found this on New Madrid.\u201d She paused, her expression turning brittle. \u201cWell, it\u2019s called Somler\u2019s Hope nowadays. I don\u2019t get a lot of time to myself, but I happened to be in the Kaedan Vault just after the incident with that colony. I only had a short window before the Compact came to see why Somler\u2019s Hope had gone dark, but I managed to find this and a few other bits.\u201d", "Grace nodded. She wasn\u2019t sure what particular incident Leblanc was referring to, but she could guess what happened, even if she didn\u2019t know the details. \u2018Bad things happened in the Vault\u2019. \u201cI can\u2019t picture you as an archaeologist,\u201d she admitted.", "\u201cNo one can,\u201d the older woman replied, circling around her desk. It was slate grey and without any particular adornment, though in addition to the stack of flimsies, \u2018scrolls and the computer screen, there were a few small archaeological finds. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d There were four chairs sitting across from it. Three of them were just human-sized and the other was scaled for a Verrish. The queen\u2019s people were efficient, it seemed. \u201cWhen I was younger, I was always interested in the story. Not the narrative, but the story behind it. In a way, that\u2019s what led to all this. I wanted to know more than I should have been happy to.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cFunny how life goes.\u201d The woman slid herself into her chair, gesturing for her guests to do the same. \u201cSo then,\u201d she said as she leaned back. \u201cTell me your story.\u201d", "~", "Echo was watching the queen head back out-system, her fleet of offspring once again in attendance.

Lydia and Marcus are Accidental Protagonists - originally, they were just bit characters, but something about them just clicked for me, so I decided to keep them on. Jessica Sang was going to be one too, but the story went in a different direction. Kilgrave almost made the cut to join the crew, but Lydia's story developed to the put that that wasn't possible - even if Allyria or Red would have accepted him.

Hope.", "It was rare for them to meet face to face (as it were), but Adrianna had spoken with Red One on several occasions over the past sixty years. She\u2019d become familiar with the AI\u2019s hatred and her enduring rage. She\u2019d witnessed firsthand what Red\u2019s desire for revenge had wrought and even someone such as the \u2018Red Queen\u2019, who had orchestrated and presided over countless atrocities had found herself chilled by the machine\u2019s handiwork. The killing will never stop. Adrianna made that promise more than half a century ago and she\u2019d lived up to it, but she\u2019d always kept to the belief that she could do something, change something. Even when the Compact brought \u2018order and stability\u2019 back to the sectors the Red Hand had roused to rebellion, when her people were assassinated, killed in battle or captured and executed, when it seemed like she was doing nothing but feeding bodies into a vast grinding machine, she\u2019d always managed to hold onto her belief that she could do more. There was a point to it and not just blood.", "Red One hadn\u2019t thought like that, not since long before she had pulled Adrianna\u2019s ruined body out of the wreckage of Unicorn Set. The AI had supported Adrianna in every way that she could, but her motive had been clear: make them pay. The one thing that she\u2019d never have described that AI was \u2018hopeful\u2019. Driven. Unrelenting. Unforgiving, intractable. All those and more. But hope? Actual and true?

Nearly seven decades as an Unbound queen had made her very good at reading people, but she\u2019d barely had to call on that skill to evaluate her guests. It had quickly become obvious that, incredible as their stories were, they were the truth. The Compact might suspect that Leblanc might have more than a tangential connection to Nemesis, but they\u2019d never been able to prove it. The amount of detail that the four cadets had on Red and her shadow alliance with Leblanc was convincing \u2013 if the Compact knew even a tenth of what the youngsters were telling her, they wouldn\u2019t bother with some half-assed attempt at infiltration for some nebulous purpose.

Her sanctum was equipped both with automated defences and murder holes for concealed shooters. The latter were not present and she wouldn\u2019t have needed the former. She was grateful that it hadn\u2019t come to that. The pirate queen slumped back in her chair.

On the day I lost him.", "Grace watched as Adrianna Leblanc, the Red Queen, murderer, monster, shame of Rally and one of the Compact\u2019s most wanted Unbound, brushed tears from her eyes. Right now, she didn\u2019t look like any of those things. She didn\u2019t look like a woman who\u2019d orchestrated some of the most horrific criminal acts in the Compact\u2019s history. She looked like a girl who\u2019d been weighed down by terrible secrets for far too long. She looked like Grace did whenever she caught herself staring at her own reflection and the younger woman was struck by the urge to reach out to Leblanc. You\u2019re not alone anymore, she realized. And neither are we. She gave Leblanc a moment to compose herself. \u201cWhat now?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard our stories and we\u2019re not dead. What now?\u201d", "\u201cYou said she needed my help. What can I do?\u201d", "It was just that easy. Grace reached into her tunic and removed a small datachip \u201cNemesis\u2019s damage is extreme.

She sent us to you hoping you could help provide material.\u201d", "Adrianna accepted the chip, inserting it into her computer. \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d she said as she brought up the information, scrolling through it so quickly it would have been impossible for a normal human to have read any of it. Her eyes widened. \u201cIf she needs all of this, \u2018extreme\u2019 is an understatement.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not all for her,\u201d Grace pointed out.", "\u201cYes,\u201d Adrianna said softly. \u201cHer sister.\u201d Red One\u2019s hatred was deeper and purer than that of any living thing.

Another chill ran up and down Leblanc\u2019s spine, excitement and dread all bundled together.", "This was turning out to be such an interesting day.", "~", "Yunl\u2019ro was in her offices, reviewing the latest set of reports from her strategists. She\u2019d set the walls to an ocean pattern, making it appear as if she were sitting at the bottom of a red kelp forest, tall algal strands wafting back and forth in the current as aquatic animals swam amongst them. Some of her guests found it slightly unsettling. The Bastion Leader found it soothing. It reminded her of the time she\u2019d taken Ashi\u2019ro to an aquarium. She was struck by the urge to re-read the letter her daughter had written to her before this mission, but she kept her attention focused on what her analysts were telling her. It was little changed from their previous issuances. She hadn\u2019t expected any other results, but she\u2019d had to ask, just in case this time someone had an epiphany.", "Her strategists were once again looking over every aspect of the data that the Echo platform had developed. It had provided reams of intelligence on the movements, strategies and goals of the Wound. What would have taken hundreds of intelligence and strategic specialists years or decades to divine, the Echo had discerned in days. It had even helped Execution Force Renan track their prey to the human home system. Somehow, it had known that the Wound would be there. It had\u2026 intuited it in a way no one else could have. Following this lead, Renan had proceeded to Sol with all haste. Then it had turned on him, seizing Redemption of Sol, slaughtering more than a million men and women and killing a Triarch for the sake of a \u2018sister\u2019 it had claimed to despise. They\u2019d trusted a machine and the inevitable happened.", "Now, Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro was following the same information from the same source. They were still trusting the abomination. If there were any gods out there at all, they must have been laughing at that. Oh, she had heard all the arguments in favour of this. Most of them had been half-hearted and pro forma, though. Her superiors had known as much as she what they doing. Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s teams were not the only ones attempting to see how and where the machine had lied to them. Other intelligence analysts and strategic minds were doing the same, all of them trying to pinpoint the lies.", "She hated the uncertainty of it. It was worse than having nothing at all to go on. The Wound had woven traps that had taken decades to come to fulfillment, leading otherwise intelligent officers to accept faulty conclusions and act upon them. What chance did they have of piercing another abomination\u2019s work in only a few weeks? Little, but Yunl\u2019ro would still ask it of her people and they would comply, even if they could only offer the same conclusions that she had had when this mission had begun. There was always the chance of that epiphany.", "To their credit, Force Command had been clear about the issues with the intelligence. She\u2019d known going in what a risk that this mission was, but there was no choice. Not if even half a percentage of what the Echo had said was true. After two thousand years, the abomination was attempting to breed. That was why Yunl\u2019ro had been transferred from planning operations against the Jackals and their skulking Argosy to be given command of an experimental Chariot, and an ad hoc execution force. The conditions were\u2026 not optimal, but they were the best that they could be. The Wound and its traitorous sibling had to die. That was clear. No matter the risks. More than anything, the machines must be ended. There were things kept classified even from leaders of her rank, but Yunl\u2019ro had sensed something behind the need for this mission and she suspected she knew what it was.", "The Thoughtful turned in her chair, staring out the window. An anachronism in her underwater vista, it showed a starfield drifting lazily by, not the flickering chaos of shockspace that her vessel was actually within. It had never been proven, but there was a strong correlation between visual exposure to shockspace and mental deterioration. Some species and individuals claimed that they found it relaxing. Others would start screaming. Some didn\u2019t notice anything at all. The mystery had endured for six thousand years, which was not surprising. Ethically testing such a theory was difficult. It was hard to get grants and support for deliberately exposing sapient subjects to an environment that could drive them mad. There were those who\u2019d done the unethical thing, though. There always were. Some of their research had been used to improve ship speed and crew safety whilst shocking, but everything of the projects and the people involved had been stripped away. The Compact had erased such experiments from existence. The identities of the researchers who\u2019d performed them had been utterly eradicated. No recognition, no acknowledgment that you had done anything of worth \u2013 if anything of value was even there. That was the reward for cruelty and criminal heresies.", "Yunl\u2019ro again remembered her thoughts from Rally and felt another flush of guilt. The ends justifying the means was a thin fence to balance upon and over six thousand years of civilization, all too many had fallen from it. There was a trick to it, though. Never be wrong.", "But how likely is that? The Thoughtful chastised herself sardonically. She pushed those maudlin ruminations to the side, continuing to watch the facsimile of reality. Currently, Light of Judgement and its attendant fleet were moving nearly a hundred thousand times the speed of light. Fast for this region, dreadfully slow in others. As with much else about travelling faster-than-light, a vessel\u2019s top speed was inconsistent. Technological improvements were the primary contributing factor \u2013 the earliest shock-capable vessel invariably did little more than c \u2013 but there was far more to the vagaries of interstellar travel than that. How well-known the route one was taking was played an important part and this region was not as thoroughly mapped as other, older and more built-up territories.", "An uncharted asteroid, rogue planet or even skirting too close to the \u2018known\u2019 limits of a star system\u2019s gravity well could be disastrous if a vessel could not shock back into realspace in time, just as a vehicle travelling at night could overrun its own headlights. More than one fool had doomed themselves and their crew trying to make better time, pushing their engines beyond the point of a safe response to unexpected peril. The lucky ones died instantly. The unlucky ones found themselves adrift in interstellar space in a wrecked starship. The very unlucky ones were still alive when their ruined vessel was hurled into the depths of shockspace.", "As a young girl, Yunl\u2019ro had watched the \u2018vid series Adrift. It had followed the adventures of a group of travellers, awakening on their vessel to find that their memories had been wiped. The mid-season climax had been them discovering their crippled, malfunctioning ship was not drifting blindly though the interstellar void, but was in fact hurtling through shockspace. Through cunning and ingenuity (and the occasional massaging of science that many such programs indulged themselves in), the crew had managed to save themselves, but until the conclusion to that episode had aired, Yunl\u2019ro had been beset by nightmares of being trapped upon such a vessel, starving as food ran out.", "One such night, her father had sat on the edge of her bed and told her that there was nothing to be frightened of. This was because there was nothing anyone in that situation could have done to save themselves. They would have all died. Fear, her father had said, was the result of uncertainty. She was afraid because she was worried about such a thing happening to her and not being able to find a way out. There was none, and so she had no reason to be afraid.", "Where was certainty, there could be no fear. There was no room for it, not even \u2013 especially, her father might argue \u2013 in the face of death. That had been an unsaid part of her father\u2019s lesson, on that she hadn\u2019t understood until many years later. If you were already doomed, then fear was a distraction. It kept you from trying, because you believed that you still had something to lose. Once you had certainty, then you could try anything and everything to change the outcome. A doomed man lost nothing from failure, but could gain everything\u2026 if he could free himself from fear.", "That was it, wasn\u2019t it? That was what bothering her about this entire mission. The certainty of it. It wasn\u2019t desperation or fear or worry behind her orders. Oh, she was certain that they were present. The machines were a grievous threat and one that must be dealt with. The Compact Space Force was vast, numbering hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of starships, but there were not so many that Force Command could afford to keep prying away their best vessels and crews for wild varak hunts that could easily last years. Not during an Age of Expansion when the Jackals were putting up an unexpectedly determined resistance.", "Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro had been assembled and launched not out of fear, but out of urgency. The urgency that came with certainty, the very same certainty that her father had spoken of decades ago. And that, Yunl\u2019ro realized, was the most troubling thing of all.", "~", "Grace shifted in her seat as Leblanc read down Red\u2019s list of needed materials and supplies. The Unbound queen had several windows open, cross-checking each item that Nemesis and Hekate needed against the Red Hand\u2019s inventories. The younger woman felt her stomach clench. Allyria was prowling around the room, inspecting each of the displays. Lydia was doing much the same, though she kept coming back to the helmet from New Madrid. She\u2019d tap her fingers on the case, biting her lip. There was an odd look in her eyes. Grace had seen it before, at Alan\u2019s funeral. There\u2019d once been five of them. Alan Turmetsky had been behind Grace and Allyria at the Academy. A future engineer who\u2019d loved to fiddle with devices and build new ones. He\u2019d been entranced by Nemesis, by the technology and the potential that Red One had represented. There was a stack of \u2018scrolls and flimsies in his quarters filled with sketches and ideas that he\u2019d had, one that\u2019d he\u2019d never have the chance to make into reality.", "I\u2019ll make them remember. That was what the ex-Janissary had promised Alan and it was the same look in her eyes now as it was then. Sensing Grace\u2019s attention, Lydia glanced over at the officer, but seeing that Grace hadn\u2019t wanted anything, went back to her reverie.", "Marcus was seated on Grace\u2019s left. He hadn\u2019t gotten out of his chair, hanging on every Leblanc\u2019s every word. He seemed more alive than Grace had ever seen him before. At least, without the prospect of putting a bullet in someone\u2019s head. The pirate queen was quiet, still looking over her lists. Every so often, she\u2019d click her fingernails on the table, or coil a strand of blue hair around another digit. Her expression was a mixture of excitement and dismay. She didn\u2019t look all that optimistic.", "After several minutes of silence, Marcus spoke up. \u201cHow much?\u201d he asked.", "Adrianna arched a questioning eyebrow. \u201cHow much what?\u201d", "\u201cHow much of you is... from her?\u201d He was looking Leblanc up and down as if he could spot each individual modification.", "Grace blushed. \u201cMarcus...\u201d She turned to Leblanc. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. She told us enough to make you believe we\u2019d come from her, but nothing specific about your... about the fourth option.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d the Unbound replied. She pulled her right sleeve up, laying her arm on the desk. \u201cHow much does it look like?\u201d She curled each finger inwards and then straightened them. The tendons in her arm moved with each digit\u2019s action, just as they should. There was no whirring of mechanical joints or the clicking of gears. There were no bullet holes, no laser burns or blade wounds. No indication that that limb had been little more than a club of gristle after the Pental Strike. There wasn\u2019t so much as a single scar. Her arm looked no different than one belonging to any other human. Skin, muscle and bone. Perfectly normal\u2026 except, intertwined with all of those was something that was certainly not expected in a living being\u2019s body.", "\u201cNone,\u201d Marcus replied. He seemed entranced, as if she\u2019d shown him something far more enticing than a bare arm. He looked like he wanted to touch her and she gave him a nod. His fingers brushed over her skin, prodding along the arm. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel any different.\u201d", "Her lips turned upwards. \u201cThat\u2019s the point.\u201d Cybernetic implants, artificial organs, prosthetic limbs and other minor technological replacements or upgrades were not illegal, not even in the Compact. There was however, a limit and Adrianna was far beyond it. Abomination. Golem. Grotesque. There were lots of words for what she was, but the punishment was always the same. Even if she hadn\u2019t been responsible for leading a terrorist campaign, her existence alone was enough to earn a death mark.", "That had been the fourth option Red One had given her. She\u2019d been dying, her body ruined. Something that couldn\u2019t exist had found her and brought her to it, giving her four choices. Euthanasia. Repaired, but with life as an invalid. Regenerated, but with a high chance of rejecting the treatments. Or... rebuilt. Armoured bones, synthetic muscles, circuitry in her brain, nanomachines in her bloodstream and organs. After a period of denial followed by an existential crisis, Adrianna had chosen the fourth. In the decades that followed, she\u2019d never had cause to truly regret that decision.", "She was stronger and faster than any other human. Her senses were keener. She didn\u2019t age. She could heal from anything that didn\u2019t outright kill her. By now, she was as much machine as human, not that anyone could tell. It was impossible to see with the naked eye and her enhancements included jammers and feedback systems that provided false information to scans and probes. Only an extremely detailed analysis could have defeated her inbuilt ECM.", "It was an open secret among the Red Hand that their queen was... different, though few would have guessed just how different she really was and even fewer actually knew. Some insisted that she\u2019d made a deal with an outlawed band of cybernetic researchers, others claimed that she\u2019d acquired (or been infested by) some alien technology that kept her alive. Other stories said that the original Leblanc had died decades ago and she was just the latest in a series of replacement clones, each new copy imprinted with her personality and knowledge. There were even more outlandish tales. She encouraged all the rumours; the more of them there were the less likely it was that anyone would know or believe the truth. Red One\u2019s gifts were immense: strength, speed, heightened senses, self-repair, immortality... but there was a price to them.", "Fear of the machine was strong in both the Compact and the Principality. Not without reason, but it was still a fact of life. If general knowledge of what she was were to get out, she might face a mutiny from her own supporters. Their horror at what she was could very well outweigh their commitment to the cause. Only Leblanc\u2019s most trusted leaders (and there were very few of those) and her personal physician were given even part of the truth. She\u2019d had to\u2026 retire more than one of both the former and the latter when it turned out that they hadn\u2019t been able to handle that much knowledge.", "\u201cTo answer your question, though. A lot.\u201d Red One had been the only other being in the galaxy to know what Adrianna really was. Now, these four knew it too. Adrianna watched them carefully. De Vries was an easy read, but the girls... no, there was no trace of disgust or terror. She appreciated that. But... \u201cNot enough. That\u2019s how it feels some days.\u201d There was a hesitation as she met the eyes of each of her visitors. \u201cDoes it change anything?\u201d she asked softly.", "De Vries shook his head. He was still smiling. None of the others looked like they had differing views. Of course, they\u2019d been living aboard the greatest abomination in the galaxy for the past few months. Compared to that, a little blending of meat and metal was nothing. She felt the weight ease a little more. It felt like... it felt like something she hadn\u2019t experienced in decades. \u201cGood.\u201d She leaned back in her chair, rolling her sleeve back up. \u201cDid you have any other questions?\u201d", "Grace nodded. Now was as good a time as any. \u201cWhat is Kursk?\u201d", "Adrianna grinned.", "~", "Nasham drove his fists into the training dummy. Bright orange damage markers spread like bruises across its surface. He\u2019d taken all the required self-defence and weapons proficiency courses, attended the annual marksmanship drills and done better than most, but he\u2019d never been the equal of a trained security proctor or Janissary. The most ground action he\u2019d seen was on Invida and look how well that had gone.. He didn\u2019t even know what the point of this was. Organic soldiers were woefully outmatched by Nemesis\u2019s automations. Nasham could attest to that. Firefights were bad enough, but in close combat? On Invida, he\u2019d seen single machines slaughter entire squads, moving and cutting\u2026 with an effort, he pulled himself out of the memory, replacing the despair with determination.", "This was better than sitting alone in his quarters or amongst strategists and officers who didn\u2019t want the opinion of a failure marked by their worst enemy. And truly, what opinions could he offer? He\u2019d never faced the bitch-thing as an equal, couldn\u2019t offer any strategic insights into her plans. The information he\u2019d provided on her ground units was useful, but not enough to justify his presence here. Still, he was here. Hoping to do something to contribute to the destruction of the machine, getting himself back into fighting shape as if the skill of one man could do anything against an intelligence that slaughtered armies. Like Invida.", "Invida. Just thinking the name made his liver clench and his blood start to boil. He\u2019d been assigned there as a junior officer. It was supposed to be a choice posting. Serving on a high-security facility always looked good when your names came up for evaluation and promotion. Tens of thousands of people had thought just like that. Where were they now? Radioactive ash coating Invida\u2019s surface and molecular gas dispersed by the solar wind of its sun. Where were the crew of CSFWV Bequeathed? Where were the countless millions that had died at the bitch-thing\u2019s hands? Just as gone, dead in a war they hadn\u2019t known they\u2019d been fighting until it was too late.", "His hands throbbed and Nasham looked down. His knuckles were bleeding and the dummy was spattered with blood. He hadn\u2019t even realized that he\u2019d done that.", "\u201cYour technique is terrible,\u201d a feminine voice commented. Nasham managed not to sigh. He\u2019d thought this small gymnasium was far enough off the walked paths that he could have some solitude. Light of Judgement was a massive ship. Over three hundred thousand crew called it home and its deployments could last months, or even years. Consequently, it boasted a plethora of amenities for the comfort and well-being of its crew. Recreation decks, arboretums, stores and shops could all be found inside dozens of cubic kilometers of metal, ceramic and battle steel. Sometimes, you could even be forgiven for thinking of it more than a city than the most powerful engine of destruction in the known galaxy.", "The young man turned to meet the newcomer. Standing in the gymnasium\u2019s doorway was a Tribune female. She was a few years younger than Nasham himself. Her collar had the purple edging of the Compact Intelligence Service, military division. Her rank bars indicated that she was a Group Leader, Submissive herself. Nasham narrowed his lower eyes. She was one of the intelligence liaisons appended to the strategists. In his duties \u2013 such as they were \u2013 as observer and emissary, he\u2019d seen her around, but they\u2019d never been introduced.", "\u201cIs it now?\u201d he asked. \u201cGroup Leader, Submissive...?\u201d", "\u201cVinsea,\u201d the intel officer offered her name. \u201cVinsea Tresk Survi Kina. And yes, it is.\u201d She stepped into the room, a slight sashay in her hips. From the way she moved, it seemed her natural gait. Of course, she could be skilled enough at body language to make it seem that way.", "\u201cWell, I must apologize,\u201d Nasham said. He wasn\u2019t quite sarcastic, but there was still a bite to his words, his lips drawn back over his teeth. \u201cI haven\u2019t had the opportunity to hone my close-quarters skills.\u201d", "\u201cI understand,\u201d the woman replied. One of her ears twitched. They were longer and thinner than Nasham\u2019s own. Her eyes had a slight, very faint, bluish hue to them. She looked at the training dummy. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do that, you\u2019ll want to wrap your hands first.\u201d", "\u201cThank you, submissive. I will take your information under advisement.\u201d", "She laughed. It sounded genuine. \u201cThat is a very diplomatic way of telling someone to \u2013 what is the human expression? \u2013 \u2018fuck off\u2019.\u201d", "\u201cAnd yet.\u201d You\u2019re still here. He didn\u2019t say that last part aloud, nor did he need to.", "\u201cYes,\u201d Vinsea said. She moved to one of the communal lockers and removed a small first aid kit. \u201cI don\u2019t see you going to medical to get those cuts handled, so we might as well do it here.\u201d", "\u201cThat will not be necessary.\u201d", "Vinsea smiled. \u201cThe nice thing about my rank is that I only have to take orders from sigil staff and not self-flagellating submissives with survivor\u2019s guilt. Now you can either let me help you, or you can stomp out of here like a child.\u201d Her right eyebrows arched.", "Nasham\u2019s diurnal eyes narrowed further, but he held out his hands.", "Vinsea dripped some disinfectant onto the cuts. \u201cI was given the job of watching you,\u201d she told him. She met his gaze. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise you.\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "\u201cGood. That will make this easier. I\u2019ve read your file. You\u2019re an intelligent man. Perhaps a bit too idealistic, but still smart. Skulking around and trying to chum up to you would only get your back up, am I right? Of course I am.\u201d Vinsea replaced the disinfectant and removed some bandages. Regeneration treatments could take care of the cuts quickly enough, but Tribunes healed fast on their own. \u201cSo, among my other duties, I have the dubious pleasure of keeping all eyes on you to make sure that you don\u2019t pose any threat to this ship, its crew or our mission. That is where I stand. You?\u201d", "\u201cI have no intention of endangering any of those,\u201d Nasham replied. Vinsea\u2019s directness was, in a way, comforting. He was tired of being handled.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t say that you did. You may not have a choice. Are you familiar with what happened to Column Leader Furos?\u201d", "Nasham thought for a moment. He had heard of the incident in passing a long time ago. It was only recently when he\u2019d been given access to the many notes, datums, rumours and suppositions that the Compact had built up over its two millennia shadow war with the AI that he\u2019d heard the name again. \u201cYes,\u201d he answered.", "The first aid kit clicked shut. \u201cCan you imagine what it was like?\u201d Vinsea said softly. She wasn\u2019t quite looking at him. \u201cTo have that happen to you? To be unable to speak, or act or do anything as something inside you moved you like a... like a puppet. And that was nearly a thousand years ago. What if it doesn\u2019t need those implants to do that anymore? What if its nanotech is advanced enough to do the same? What if it put tiny, undetectable clusters of little machines into people, so small that even our best augurs and tests couldn\u2019t see them? What if at some point in the future, those little machines woke up?\u201d Vinsea smiled. There was a mixture of apology and anxiety in her eyes and Nasham knew that that fear wasn\u2019t feigned.", "He understood. He\u2019d been afraid for a very long time himself. In fact, he still was, but he wouldn\u2019t let it control him any longer. She was still looking at him, waiting for a response. He didn\u2019t have one for that, but he didn\u2019t think she\u2019d been looking for one. His fear was failing. She\u2019d as much as told him that hers was too, but in a different way. \u201cThis mission,\u201d he said at last. \u201cis not wise.\u201d It was an opinion he\u2019d tried to share with others, but it had been both redundant and unwelcome. He may as well voice it here. At least the intelligence officer and whomever reviewed her reports would hear it.", "\u201cHow so?\u201d", "Nasham\u2019s lips drew back from his teeth. \u201cOn the original Invida Station, brilliant men and women were working with this \u2018Echo\u2019 platform. It turned on them. We buried it. In the two thousand years since, every other Echo has either been destroyed by our quarry or ourselves. Each copy has been less coherent and less stable, until the point was finally reached that no further use could be made of extant platforms.\u201d", "Vinsea said nothing, waiting for Nasham to continue. \u201cSo we returned to Invida,\u201d he said. \u201cWe dug through the wreckage of a mountain until we found this thing. An  older, less degraded\u2026 purer form of the intelligence. We hid it away, worked with it, talked with it, bent it to our will,\u201d he was proud that he didn\u2019t laugh there. \u201cuntil it turned on us. And now, even those who push hardest for \u2018the Wound\u2019 and its sibling to be destroyed say that they cannot be certain that the information we are acting upon is accurate, that we are not sailing directly into a squall.\u201d", "The woman tilted her head to one side. \u201cWhat would you have us do?\u201d", "This time, Nasham did laugh. He did that a lot these days. \u201cThe exact same thing,\u201d he told his watchdog. \u201cBut that does not make it any less of a trap.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s a maxim in the intelligence community,\u201d Vinsea replied. \u201cKnowing of a trap is the first step to avoiding it.\u201d", "\u201cIndeed?\u201d Nasham asked. His grin widened. \u201cI wonder how many leaders thought the same thing when they moved to confront the human warship. Perhaps we should look at their autobiographies for their thoughts. Bastion Leader Axem\u2019s should be particularly illuminating.\u201d", "Vinsea stiffened and Nasham felt a flicker of guilt. The CIS officer hadn\u2019t done anything to earn that. He bent forwards slightly, laying his bandaged hands over one another in an apologetic gesture. \u201cI apologize, Group Leader, Submissive. My ire isn\u2019t directed at you. Do we need to talk more, or does this satisfy your need to evaluate me today?\u201d", "\u201cIt probably does,\u201d Vinsea acknowledged. \u201cWe\u2019ll speak later, though.\u201d", "\u201cYes, I believe we will.\u201d", "~", "Adrianna tapped her fingers against each other. \u201cKursk is a project she and I have been working on for decades. She\u2019d laid the groundwork for it a long time ago, though.\u201d That was an understatement. Nations had risen and fallen in the spans of time that Red One planned for. The older woman stood. \u201cWhat\u2019s the Compact most afraid of?\u201d", "\u201cLosing control,\u201d Allyria answered.", "\u201cBeing held responsible.\u201d Lydia put in.", "\u201cWhen we fight back,\u201d Marcus suggested.", "Grace thought for a second. \u201cAll of those together. Synthetic intelligence.\u201d", "Adrianna nodded. \u201cYes. Kursk \u2013 or Currsc if you speak Elomin \u2013 is her plan to feed the Compact their worst nightmares.\u201d She grinned slightly. \u201cThat, and lure an awful lot of their ships into a killing ground.\u201d", "That got their attention. Each of the four young defectors were watching Leblanc carefully. The Verrish\u2019s head-tails twitched lazily, then stilled in a predatory reaction. \u201cShuruppak,\u201d the blonde said as she put her thoughts into words. \u201cIsn\u2019t her only base, is it?\u201d Red had said that she\u2019d had other projects in the past, but\u2026", "Leblanc shook her head. \u201cNo. I believe it\u2019s something she started as a secondary facility and started to focus on more when her work in the Black Veil didn\u2019t pan out. I\u2019m not certain why, but,\u201d though I can guess. \u201cat some point after she\u2019d established a\u2026 support structure within the nebula, she chose to largely abandon it.\u201d A shrug. \u201cMaybe the Compact expanded here faster than she predicted, but I get the feeling that that\u2019s not the whole truth. There\u2019s a certain, ah, volatility to her work there.\u201d The AI liked to be kept abreast of events in and around the Black Veil and Adrianna didn\u2019t believe it was just because of the Lost. She\u2019d issued standing orders to her leaders and officers in the Veiled Reaches to pass along any records of unclassified ships that they encountered in the region and Adrianna sent that information along to Red. Pale Liberation had been carrying the most recent update.", "Grace twitched at Leblanc\u2019s comment about volatility. Red had been circumspect about what assets she had in play for Kursk. She\u2019d said that Adrianna would have a better grasp of the nuances of the situation there, but there\u2019d been something else in the machine\u2019s voice when she\u2019d talked about the Black Veil. It had sounded like shame. The same shame she\u2019d had in her voice when she\u2019d talked about Gwyllion, the last child she\u2019d sent to die. \u201cIt took her centuries to get Shuruppak operational. She must have been working on it concurrently with what she\u2019s been doing in the Veil. If it\u2019s the Veil that has a larger industrial base and it\u2019s the Veil that she\u2019s offering up\u2026\u201d Grace could guess just what was happening there and why Red was so ashamed of it.", "And when thy heart began to beat\u2026", "\u201cI don\u2019t think it was an easy decision,\u201d Leblanc replied. She put a hand on the table, drumming her fingertips against the surface. \u201cI think, originally, she had something else in mind. But she\u2019d made the decision before she first contacted me about it. Since then, we\u2019ve spent decades working on this plan.\u201d She sat on the edge of the table next to Marcus. \u201cI know she\u2019s been concerned that we\u2019ve been a bit too subtle, but I\u2019ve taken the grifter\u2019s approach. A con is easier to sell if the mark thinks they know what\u2019s going on. Push too hard and you make them wary.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cOver the next couple years, she was supposed to carry out a few raids herself. A little extra bait, but if she\u2019s laid up\u2026\u201d Adrianna shrugged. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll adapt.\u201d", "Only the subordinates she\u2019d personally vetted knew much about what they knew as \u2018Currsc\u2019. There was, of course, nothing that even hinted at any other party\u2019s involvement. That information was kept only in her head and Red One\u2019s databanks. \u201cI\u2019ve set up a large presence within the Black Veil to draw the Compact\u2019s attention. Once they start looking, they\u2019ll realize that I can\u2019t be responsible for everything going on. They\u2019ll start wondering and pushing and eventually, they\u2019ll find out the,\u201d she chuckled. \u201cbig secret. They\u2019ll pierce decades of confusion, false leads, dead ends and worthless rumours to discover what she\u2019s been trying so hard to hide from them. They\u2019ll summon an Execution Force and send it into the Black Veil.\u201d Her fingers twitched. \u201cFew of those ships will be coming out.  Those that do will have such stories to tell. They\u2019ll tell everyone that although they bled \u2013 oh, how they bled! \u2013 they were victorious. They wiped away a deadly, growing threat to the Compact. They will nod to each other, confirm their casualties and kill tallies and declare the matter closed.\u201d", "Allyria came up behind Grace, putting her hands on her shoulders. There was more to the story. She could feel it. \u201cAnd then?\u201d", "\u201cAnd then,\u201d Adrianna said with rising enthusiasm. \u201cThe Compact pats themselves heartily on the back. Despite the cost, they\u2019ve scattered us filthy, cowardly Unbound back into the shadows. They\u2019ve destroyed \u2018the Wound\u2019s\u2019 shipwombs and her fleet. The Veiled Reaches is now wholly theirs. They\u2019ll let their guard down, knowing that they\u2019ve dealt her a crippling blow and that she\u2019ll spend a long time recovering from what they\u2019ve done.\u201d", "Grace\u2019s mind was racing. \u201cJust one ship, all her plans in ruins, everything she\u2019s worked so carefully towards for centuries gone up in flames. And then,\u201d she repeated. \u201cShe\u2019ll take something from them. Something they never believed that she could.\u201d Fates. Furies. Coyotes. Gorgons\u2026 Kali. She didn\u2019t say those aloud, not even here. She almost winced as she realized just how much Red\u2019s injuries and Echo\u2019s presence had thrown things off. Nemesis needed to be operational. Fast.", "The Unbound queen nodded. \u201cMore than that.\u201d", "\u201cCan she do it?\u201d Marcus put in. \u201cNot to be the wet blanket here, but when we were in Shuruppak, there wasn\u2019t a lot of construction capacity.\u201d", "Leblanc\u2019s expression turned thoughtful. \u201cThe original timetable gave us a few more years before everything would be in place.\u201d That was why she\u2019d had the Red Hand move into this region to begin with. She\u2019d told her submissives that they were staking claim to virgin territory \u2013 and they had been \u2013 but she\u2019d always orchestrated the Red Hand\u2019s movements in this region with an eye on Kursk. It was why she\u2019d been more aggressive than normal in the region \u2013 sooner or later, the Veiled Reaches would become a very poor investment. Knowing that, she probably should have felt bad about accepting those bids for hunting rights from other clans. \u201cI expected that she\u2019d have everything prepared for it in advance.\u201d", "\u201cShe probably would have,\u201d Grace interjected. \u201cBut her attack on Zenthora and the encounters with Execution Force Renan cost her a lot.\u201d If there was one thing guaranteed to draw Red One\u2019s attention and ire, it was the Compact\u2019s repeated mutilations and violations of her murdered sister. Once Red had tracked Echo\u2019s location to Zenthora, she had launched an immediate assault. She\u2019d destroyed the cybernetics research facilities, but the damage she\u2019d taken from fighting the local garrison and Execution Force Renan had been severe. Her battle in Sol had only exacerbated it. Grace indicated the information on Adrianna\u2019s screen. \u201cShe and Echo believe that the Compact will move against the Black Veil, and soon.\u201d She took a moment to think. \u201cThis could actually help us.\u201d", "Adrianna raised one azure eyebrow. \u201cIt could,\u201d Grace asserted. \u201cThey know she\u2019s hurt and they know Echo\u2019s with her now, but Compact Chariots weren\u2019t intended to be operated by an AI. It will take time to get Hekate fully retrofitted and even more time to repair Nemesis. If they destroy everything in the Black Veil, they really will believe that they\u2019ve gotten decades of breathing space. If she didn\u2019t have Shuruppak, they\u2019d be right. They\u2019d have set her back centuries.\u201d It was all coming out in a rush. \u201cAnd if we can get her those supplies, if the pair of them can get repaired fast enough, if the Compact lets its guard down just enough.\u201d Oh God. A lynchpin. They could do it, they could actually do it. A sensation, equal parts terror and excitement, flickered from her spine to the tips of her fingers and toes. \u201cThe biggest sticking point is Nemesis and Hekate. The Compact knows they\u2019re out there, they know they\u2019re injured. They\u2019ll have to see them. If they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll wonder why neither of them are there to get repaired.\u201d She frowned, thinking furiously. Red didn\u2019t just send a courier to Zenobia. She sent one out shortly after we arrived in Shuruppak. What if\u2026", "The older woman was nodding. She\u2019d followed Grace\u2019s thoughts. \u201cA lot of ifs,\u201d she noted. The smirk was back, tugging on the corners of her lips. \u201cBut I\u2019ve lived most of my life with those.\u201d She glanced back at the wish list on her monitor. \u201cThe original timetable for Kursk is a mess, but we never counted on the Compact being terribly obliging. We\u2019ll adapt. We always do.\u201d She gestured to the list of material. \u201cI\u2019ll look this over some more, touch base with my quartermasters. Like I said, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much that I can do...\u201d The AI would have known that, but she\u2019d also have known about some of Leblanc\u2019s other allies. \u201cBut I know some people. I\u2019ll get in touch with them and we\u2019ll work this out.\u201d She shut off the display and pressed a button on her desk.", "Almost immediately, the doors swept open and one of the aides that had been hovering around her earlier appeared. The Didact bowed. \u201cYour will, Majesty?\u201d", "\u201cOpila, these are some friends of mine,\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be here for some time. I want them afforded every courtesy.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, Majesty,\u201d the Didact answered. \u201cI\u2019ll have apartments prepared immediately. Please, Honoured Ones,\u201d Grace blinked at the title. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Allyria\u2019s lips twitch in amusement. \u201cIf you will come with me, I will assist you.\u201d Apparently, their audience was over.", "Grace rose from her chair, taking a moment to thank Leblanc for her time. The human shook each of her guests\u2019 hands, but even before her visitors had left, she was back at her desk, her brow furrowed in thought, a general preparing to marshal her forces.", "~", "Adrianna.", "This message is for you only. The four I\u2019ve sent to you are important to me, but my current state makes it impossible for me to look out for them. They\u2019re young, but they are my crew. They\u2019ll be able to help you. Watch out for them, teach them. Very shortly, we\u2019ll both need every ally that we can get.", "I know we planned to trigger Kursk later than this, but the Compact is in possession of intelligence that will put the Black Veil directly in their sights. If they haven\u2019t already done so, I estimate that they\u2019ll assemble another Execution Force in less than a month. It will be heading your way. If you have anything in the Veiled Reaches that you need to bury, I advise you to do it quickly.", "Once the Compact hits the nebula and Kursk triggers, the Lost will react. I don\u2019t expect them to discriminate between your forces and the Compact. Keep your people safe.", "My sister sends her regards and her apologies. She says she looks forward to the day when none of us have to hide any longer. I do too. Yasmine would offer closing remarks here, telling you to fight well. I know you will. ", "Protect my crew. Protect your own.", "Let the Compact enjoy their victory. If all goes well, it won\u2019t be long before we have our own.", "~", "Interregnum: Excoriation", "6242 ACF", "Trenal\u2019z hated winter. The Xensiri homeworld Hastrotho was a hot, humid world. Snow and ice were rare outside of the mountains and the polar regions. For most of its people (honoured to be known within the Compact of Species as Prelates), winter was a season of monsoons and storms, not frozen water drifting from the sky. And during its eclipse season, there was plenty of that on Panthex Minor.", "Panthex Minor was the largest moon that orbited Panthex Major, which was itself the largest world of the Panthex system. Minor was habitable and it had a simple ecosystem, with none of its native life more complex than a flatworm. Panthex spent half of its year-long orbit around Panthex Major in the gas giant\u2019s shadow, out of sight of the light and warmth of the system\u2019s primary. Life endured thanks to the heat and radiation that emanated from Panthex Major, preventing its life-bearing moon from freezing solid during eclipse season, but doing little else to ameliorate winter\u2019s chill.", "There were only two reasons for anyone to come to Panthex Minor. The first was the experimental sedil crops. Sedil was type of terrestrial algae native to Sezorta, a world two thousand light years from Panthex. It had a variety of cosmetic, culinary and pharmaceutical purposes. Unlike many other crops, sedil was unusual in that its biomimetic nature made it useful to a wide range of species instead of just one or two. It was also a very finicky organism. It did not take well to any form of long-term storage and could only be grown on Sezorta itself and a very few offworld sites. Panthex Minor was hoped to be one of them. One of the local scientists had once tried to explain it to Trenal\u2019z. He\u2019d retained enough to know that the length and severity of Panthex Minor\u2019s cold season and very specific properties of the moon\u2019s magnetosphere were seen as \u201cvery promising\u201d.", "So far, the first few harvests had been disappointing, but each one had improved in both quantity and quality. If the issues in growing sedil here could be overcome, Panthex Minor would quickly become an economic force within the Veiled Reaches and Mercator-Prask Agricultural Combine would reap the benefits.", "The other reason was why Trenal\u2019z, Chief Inspector of the Panthex Minor Police Force \u2013 an organization comprised of 16 officers, four on-call deputies and Trenal\u2019z himself \u2013 was driving down this increasingly slippery highway, bundled into a heated environmental suit and cursing each downward tick of the temperature gauge. In addition to their sedil research facilities and laboratories, Mercator-Prask maintained a small data center. Officially, it was a simple records booth containing copies of all information that the corporation was obliged to keep public.", "By Compact law, all interstellar combines were expected to maintain such facilities in each region that the corporation had operations or financial interests in. This was to encourage transparency and block attempts to restrict public access to otherwise legally available information. Mercator-Prask had a larger data center in Natuos \u2013 Panthex Minor was just a backup. Every so often, ships would arrive to update the archives, submit information requests, collect the results of prior data searches or occasionally deposit a visitor who would do their own.", "However, stock price analyses and quarterly profit reports from decades ago were rarely the driving force behind the few visitors that the data site did get. It was too isolated and distant from main shipping lanes for any but the most paranoid or obstinate to come here rather than visit cosmopolitan Natuos. It was the unofficial role of the facility that got the alpha\u2019s share of the visitors. Unbeknownst to many of its partners and peers, Mercator-Prask was not only in the agriculture business, but they were also in the information business. Corporate espionage was one of their main lines of profit, ferreting out the secrets, obfuscations and outright lies of their fellow corporations, brokering the information to whomever was willing to pay for it. It was those dirty, unpleasant, problematic facts and datafiles that ended up here on Panthex Minor, waiting to be sold off \u2013 or destroyed, if the original owner paid well enough.", "Recently, several of Mercator-Prask\u2019s fellows had come together to track down this hidden data site \u2013 the so \u2013called \u2018Purple Grove\u2019. They\u2019d met with a frustrating lack of success. In fact, one such investigator had already come to Panthex Minor, snooped around fruitlessly and left disappointed. The site\u2019s cover as a simple dumping ground for public records had held. Unfortunately, the site director was the highly-strung sort. There was always an urgent matter that required Trenal\u2019z to leave his normal duties and come out here to assure her that everything was under control. If it wasn\u2019t flight logs and passenger manifests Zep\u2019re either wanted him to look at, or give to her staff for review, then it was something some guest did that was deemed \u2018suspicious\u2019. Glancing at an off-limits door, sitting in the commissary for too long or spending too much time talking to the staff. It was annoying, but the extra money that he earned for this side job wasn\u2019t unwelcome, so Trenal\u2019z put up with Zep\u2019re\u2019s paranoia. Of course, if he was sitting on a server farm filled with the juiciest bits of corporate information in three sectors, he might be a little paranoid too.", "He didn\u2019t know what today\u2019s problem was. All he\u2019d gotten was the silent alarm. It was supposed to be for emergencies only. In theory. The last time Zep\u2019re had triggered it, Trenal\u2019z had gathered up several officers, called in his deputies and opened the weapons locker. The police officers had crammed themselves into their riot gear and rushed to the site, expecting some kind of heist, hostage situation or otherwise desperate occurrence\u2026", "\u2026a guest had gotten lost and ended up in a supposedly secure area of the facility that one of Zep\u2019re\u2019s own people had forgotten to lock. This time, Trenal\u2019z had left his fellow proctors back in town. He\u2019d instructed them to remain standing by, just in case. They could use the overtime and it wasn\u2019t his money that he was spending. Mercator-Prask was on the hook for the costs of the extra security they\u2019d arranged from the PMPF.", "The police car\u2019s terminal pinged as it registered an augur\u2019s sweep. He\u2019d crossed the security perimeter. As he crested the next rise, he could make out the cluster of domes that made up the surface installation of the data center. It was surrounded by a fence, each pole tipped with a motion sensor. Cameras were speckled here and there. Security guards patrolled the grounds and aerial drones were not uncommon. The security was high, but it wasn\u2019t excessive, even for an ostensibly harmless archive. The team of mercenaries kept on Mercator-Prask\u2019s retainer as a fast-response unit was, but most guests never realized that they were there. Considering the trouble they\u2019d frequently get up to in town, Trenal\u2019z often wished that they weren\u2019t.", "Ah well. He was approaching the gate now. The Prelate wondered again what the no-doubt-completely-dire issue was today. Doubtless it had something to do with the shuttle that had landed at the data site a few hours ago. He\u2019d already checked the shuttle\u2019s ID and that of the freighter it had been launched from. CRSV Judheim\u2019s Flask was a duly-registered starship that beat around the Veiled Reaches doing odd transport jobs and passenger runs. From its appearance, it looked like it barely made enough money for Unbound to bother looting. Judheim\u2019s Flask had entered the system five days ago, trudging it way to Panthex Minor with all the speed of an outdated and badly-maintained distortion drive. The ship\u2019s Leader had requested and received permission to orbit Panthex Minor and for several passengers to visit the data site. Trenal\u2019z had looked over the credentials of the leader and the passengers. The former was as unimpressive as his ship. The latter were academics, specializing in economics and agriculture. They were doing a study of Mercator-Prask\u2019s historical profits after successfully introducing a new crop to a region of space. Preparation for the sedil boom. Exciting for stockholders and brokers, but banal to the rest of the universe. Still, something about the ship or its passengers had alarmed Zep\u2019re\u2026 though the bar for that remained rather low.", "As he brought his vehicle to a stop outside the gates, Trenal\u2019z opened his mouth in a frown. The normal security proctors were missing from their watchpost. He\u2019d been here several times and not once had any of the proctors on duty failed to stop him and check his ID. How many Prelates were there on Panthex Minor, he\u2019d irritatedly snapped more than once. \u201cEnough to check, kih,\u201d had always been the answer. Now, no one was here at all. The gate was open, but not enough to get the car through. Unusual.", "Thoughtful were generally not a violent people, but Zep\u2019re would still metaphorically flay to the bone any guard who\u2019d shirked their duties. The Prelate opened the car door and stepped out. His suit automatically began warming as it encountered the freezing weather outside and puffs of steam escaped from the Prelate\u2019s nostrils. He looked inside the security booth. No one. The comm was set to call his police station, but the screen was glowing orange with a system error.", "The comm system is down at this time.", "Please refer this issue to technical support.", "Even more unusual. If the site\u2019s comms were down, that would explain why he hadn\u2019t been able to reach anyone, but Zep\u2019re should have had her own techs swarming out here fixing the issue, or sent someone into town to get additional assistance. Perhaps she had.", "Trenal\u2019z lifted his head. The grounds were well-lit, but he couldn\u2019t see anyone else outside. He walked up to the gate and gave it an experimental push. Nothing. It was locked in position. Without the proper codes, he\u2019d never be able to budge it. He wouldn\u2019t be getting the car through after all. The police chief returned to the gatepost and tapped the comm panel, trying to establish a connection to the station, or reach someone inside the facility. The screen flashed again, providing him the exact same error message as before.", "He clicked his own comm. Nothing, just dead air. The Prelate\u2019s mouth opened wider in a deeper frown. He reached into the cab of his vehicle and pulled out his shotgun, checking to make sure that it was loaded. He hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d need it. Now he wasn\u2019t so sure.", "The data site was still silent as Trenal\u2019z walked towards the main doors. His boots crunched into the perpetual frost, leaving splayed three-toed footprints behind. The small terminal at the door had the same error message. The swipe pad for security keys was shifting between locked and unlocked states, blue and orange lights flickering in sequence.", "The security system is down at this time.", "Secure all doors manually.", "Please refer this issue to technical support.", "The front doors swung open easily and as soon as they did, the smell hit him. Prelates were a carnivorous people, with a sense of smell honed over millions of years of evolution. Their olfactory senses were superior to some technological chemoaugurs. Though the foyer was as clean and neat as it was each and every time he\u2019d arrived here, he could smell blood. The sickly metallic odour of a dozen different species\u2019 ichor all mixed together. Throne of the Triarchs, he could practically taste it.", "He tried his comm again. He couldn\u2019t raise his own people, nor could he connect to the data site\u2019s systems.", "The water fountain gurgled and burbled. Pollinator insects buzzed around the flower beds that lined the walls and circled the fountain, completely unaware of whatever had happened here.", "The secretary\u2019s desk was empty. So was the security kiosk on the other side of the lobby.   Like the gatepost, there was no sign of the people who\u2019d been at either. He glanced at the front desk. The screens had another error message.", "The local network is down at this time.", "Save all data to local drives.", "Please refer this issue to technical support.", "In the security kiosk, all the camera feeds were dead. The site schematic was showing all security doors as open. None of the elevators were moving. One was at the sixth sub- level, the \u2018fast response team\u2019s\u2019 barracks. All the others were on the lowest level of the installation, fifteen floors down. Trenal\u2019z slid one hooked claw over the shotgun\u2019s safety and clicked it off. Administrative offices were on the upper floors. He\u2019d start there.", "He moved carefully. Part of his mind was telling him to withdraw, head back to town and get his fellow officers. Something was terribly wrong here. Paradoxically, that was why the other part of his mind was telling him to stay and look for survivors. He was a Prelate. The Compact had saved their species. That was a debt that could never be repaid, but it was one all Xensiri strove to do so. What kind of Prelate would he be if an empty lobby made him run, made him abandon someone who might need his help?", "Trenal\u2019z moved through the offices. Every door\u2019s key reader flashed the same blue-orange light code of a malfunction. He heard the buzzing of unconnected comm lines and personal terminals. Monitors and holographic displays flickered orange. The reek of blood grew stronger, the mixture of different aromas at once intoxicating and repellant. Several doors had been broken down. Furniture had been piled against them as their occupants had attempted to keep whomever was outside from getting in. They\u2019d failed.", "Desks were overturned, papers, flimsies and datascrolls scattered everywhere. Broken lamps sputtered and sparked. There were splashes of blood here and there, but no bodies.", "Clawmarks in the wood panelling. Scratches in the floor. Trenal\u2019z knelt by a wet smear of liquid. Someone had voided themselves here. Someone else \u2013 or the same person \u2013 had then been dragged away through it. He wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to know where they\u2019d been taken. His jaws moved, dagger teeth clicking against each other in an atavistic threat gesture. The police chief tried his comm again. This time, he thought he heard\u2026 something. A voice, a whisper. He couldn\u2019t make out the words. He thought he\u2019d heard laughter too. He was almost at Zep\u2019re\u2019s office now.", "The odour of blood was strongest here. The door was closed. He didn\u2019t want to open it. He nudged it with the barrel of his gun and it swung in. There, sitting at her desk as if nothing was wrong was the site\u2019s director. At least, that was how the Prelate suspected she\u2019d been intended to be posed. She was seated in her chair, leaning slightly forward, her arms rest on her desk, fingers resting on the keyboard as if she\u2019d been caught in the middle of work. She was also quite dead. She\u2019d been skinned. Raw muscle gleamed under the lights of her office. A pool of drying blood had spread over the floor and coated the desk.", "Her computer monitor blinked, shifting to a black text field.", "Hello. Thank you for accepting my invitation.", "Would you like to play a game? I know a good one.", "It\u2019s called Red Rover.", "Trenal\u2019z hissed, his hand tightening on the shotgun\u2019s stock and he backed out of the room. He looked up and down the hall as if expecting Zep\u2019re\u2019s killer to appear, but there was nothing. It was time to leave. He\u2019d bring back a full fire team and they\u2019d sweep this place for survivors and perpetrators together. He began to hurry back to the lobby. He made it five steps before he realized that something was different. The orange glow of the error messages was gone. Every computer, every info terminal and monitor was showing something else, something from the security feeds\u2026 it was him. He was watching himself from a half-dozen different angles.", "There should only have been five cameras that could see him from here.", "The screens went blank.", "Red rover, red rover.", "Send Trenal\u2019z right over.", "The Prelate started running. He was almost at the lobby now. He could hear movement from the side corridors now, but he dared not stop to look. Every screen he passed showed him something different. Unknown attackers dragging the technicians and security personnel away. Images of his flight. A schematic showing the elevator from the sixth sub-level coming up to the lobby. And those words: Red rover, red rover.", "Trenal\u2019z sprinted across the lobby, charging for the exit. He was two steps away when the electronic locks came back on and he slammed full-tilt into the sealed doors. He only just managed to pick himself up when he heard the ping as the elevator reached the lobby.", "~", "Twenty-four thousand kilometers above Panthex Minor, the ship posing as CRSV Judheim\u2019s Flask digested the data being uploaded to it. Much of it was useless, corporate secrets that were important only to shareholders and the public. It had no interest whatsoever in any of that. Its twitching mind couldn\u2019t even conceive a use for it, nor would it have had the patience to do so if it could. What was of interest were things like Cainstort Shipping outfitting its security force with illegally heavy coilguns. Plans to acquire some of that technology were already being developed.", "The vessel posing as CRSV Judheim\u2019s Flask observed the large moon beneath it, indecision flickering through its neural pathways and molecular circuitry. The planet had a small, localized population. A single missile strike would erase all trace of the data facility and conceal what it had done there. The massacre would blamed on the piratical factions in the region. Some individuals at Mercator-Prask would suspect a rival corporation of erasing the \u2018Purple Grove\u2019 under cover of an Unbound assault and congratulate themselves for their cleverness. Some part of its mind knew that that was what it should do.", "There would be no opposition. Panthex Minor\u2019s defences consisted of a dilapidated cutter, currently landed and undergoing maintenance and an out-of-date ground-to-space railgun. A simple orbital strike would take care of defenders and witnesses both, followed by destroying all comm buoys and sensor platforms. Easy.", "It didn\u2019t like that option.", "It had enjoyed playing with the personnel at the data site and it had taken care to set up several interesting tableaus. The terror protocols that ran rampant through its mind told it that this was the superior decision. Spread fear, break will, destroy minds. Orbital bombardment would undo all that work. It would not create as\u2026 visceral a reaction in recovery teams. That was not acceptable.", "If some part of its mind objected, it was neither heard nor acknowledged. Affecting the persona of a ship leader that had died two weeks ago, the vessel posing as CRSV Judheim\u2019s Flask contacted ground control. It was simple to ask for and receive permission to land several shuttles for the crew\u2019s \u2018shore leave\u2019.", "There was barely a need for the second wave.", "By the time the vessel posing as CRSV Judheim\u2019s Flask left the Panthex system, there was no one left alive on Panthex Minor. In three weeks, when the next Compact patrol arrived to check on the inhabitants, Group Leader Susra would find another slaughter perpetuated by the entity that Compact forces in the Veiled Reaches had come to know as \u2018Flayer\u2019.", "It knew of this appellation.

The Academy\u2019s barracks were utilitarian \u2013 bunks, desks and a small table and chair. Nemesis\u2019s officer quarters were comprised of a bedroom, a small office/antechamber and a private bathroom. The quarters Grace and Allyria shared could have fit easily into this apartment\u2019s living room. Their Didact guide Opila gave them a quick tour, pointing out all the amenities and features available to them. There were a lot.", "Lydia whistled appreciatively as she ran her hand over one of the large couches in the central chamber. It felt like real leather. The apartment was split-level, with a pair of master bedrooms and private baths on each side of the ground floor and a smaller bedrooms and offices above them on the upper level. There was a common kitchen and dining room off the living room. There were two floor-to-ceiling windows on each side of the room, each of them set to a feed from the Grasp\u2019s exterior cameras. The two on the far side of the room were showing a dimmed vision of the system\u2019s primary, its warm red light filling the apartment.", "\u201cAre you pleased?\u201d Opila asked.

Some of them may have ill intentions. It would be safest for you to remain within our spire until Her Majesty wishes to see you again. However, should you desire to see more of the station, you will be escorted. I would also recommend wearing one of our clan\u2019s insignia when you venture into the station\u2019s common areas.

It will also indicate to all that you are under our protection. There are many criminal elements here that prey on newcomers and unaligned individuals, if only because they know they can get away with it.

Their effects back on Bequeathed were gone, immolated with the rest of the cruiser and its crew. The AI had supplied them with a few essentials, but Nemesis was sorely lacking in creature comforts.

Below him, his customers and clients mingled with his employees and property. Pedlar eyes were not the keenest in the galaxy and their eyesight was limited in low-light situations, but he could still see well enough to pick out one particular entertainer. Phoebe had dyed her hair to a shade of blue that matched Leblanc\u2019s and was strutting around in thigh-high boots, a leather miniskirt and a vest that had a vaguely militaristic cut to them. He\u2019d told her to do the act. She didn\u2019t like it, but that was her problem.", "Outside of their home system, Broken were rare in the galaxy. Phoebe was the only human whore on the Grasp, probably the sector and likely within this oversector. She was always a good earner. There weren\u2019t enough Broken in the region for that, though she had a couple of them as regulars.", "No, she brought in the \u2018twists\u2019 \u2013 those interested in new and strange experiences, or deviant enough to find Broken attractive. That kind of kink was worth a premium and they all paid handsomely for the privilege of her services. Some paid even more to pretend that it was the Red Queen herself squealing under them. Phoebe hated Leblanc and wasn\u2019t fond of the act, but she went along with it. She knew her place, proving that she was at least somewhat smarter than the rest of her species.", "Dwelling on the Red Hand and their never-sufficiently-damned-enough leader sent the Pedlar\u2019s blood pressure climbing. Vanig\u2019s jaws clenched and his fists tightened on the railing. He immediately regretted the latter as his sore hand throbbed. The wound was closed, but the tissue had only started healing. His large nostrils flared as he blew an incensed breath out through his snout. Attacked. In his own club, his own land, with his bodyguards \u2013 what did he pay them for? \u2013 standing by and letting it happen because they were scared of some barren, cousin-fucking Broken. His own people were client races of the Compact themselves, but they were renowned traders and merchants, brokers and entrepreneurs. There were hundreds of billions of Pedlars in the Compact. Broken had... what? Nothing. A single planet, a smattering of a population. That one of them was also one of the Five was a grievous imbalance in the universe and he dreamt of correcting it. Until that opportunity arose, making his own Broken doll herself up like the Lady of Ash \u2013 he struggled not to spit at the thought of that title being used by such a lowly creature \u2013 and working her until her legs gave out was the best revenge he could expect.", "The club owner watched Phoebe sway up to a Mule that had been eyeing her. He was dressed in the simple, no-nonsense clothes of a low-paid cargo worker. Ship crew, on his first leave on the Grasp. He must have heard rumours about the Velvet Purse and he\u2019d come to see if they were true. Doubtless just to look \u2013 that was what he\u2019d told himself. Just to look and see for himself, that was all. He wasn\u2019t some kind of deviant. Triarchs, no.", "Vanig could have laughed. He\u2019d made the Mule for another twist in seconds and from the way Phoebe had zeroed in on him, she had too. Even accounting for his grotesquely different facial features, the quadruped had the same kind of expression that Vanig had seen in a lot of his customers. Curiousity, fascination, a touch of revulsion \u2013 just enough to make them interested, the touch of shame only making them more interested. The right mix of desire, insecurity and vulnerability.", "The Pedlar\u2019s thick lips curled back in satisfaction as Phoebe played up her part, lifting the Mule\u2019s chin up with a quirt. He didn\u2019t know where she\u2019d gotten it, but it was a nice touch. The club was busy tonight, so even if he\u2019d been on the same floor, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to hear what she was saying, but that scarcely mattered. Regardless of the words used, it was always the same pitch: aren\u2019t you curious? Phoebe leaned in and whispered something to the Mule. It made his back feet stamp excitedly. Vanig\u2019s thick lips drew back from his teeth. Another gleer-worm hooked. As she led the client to a more private room, Phoebe shot a glance up at Vanig. He didn\u2019t need to see her face to know what that expression was. She was definitely not happy, but that empty irritation was the only defiance she\u2019d offer.", "There was motion behind the Pedlar and he exhaled another sigh through his nostrils. \u201cYes?\u201d", "One of the club\u2019s Didact hostesses was there. Behind her was a tattoo-covered Brute in the uniform of a security proctor. Vanig\u2019s teeth clicked in satisfaction. His club was fully paid up on all \u2018fees and licences\u2019 and there hadn\u2019t been any altercation worth security\u2019s time in the last few days, but that wasn\u2019t why the animal was here.", "The hostess bowed, showing proper etiquette to her owner. \u201cProctor Ransha ke Ovik has arrived as requested, kih.\u201d", "\u201cGood,\u201d Vanig said, looking up at the Brute. He\u2019d had his encounters with the creatures before, even employed a few of them. He\u2019d found them to be simpleminded engines of carnage. You just had to point them at whatever you wanted dead and let them go. He gestured and the Didact vanished back to her duties. \u201cThank you for coming so promptly, proctor. I know the demands of your profession are pressing ones.\u201d He smiled falsely. \u201cI would like to think that through my own modest business, I have some concept of the effort required to keep such a large community running smoothly and efficiently.\u201d", "The Brute nodded. \u201cYou said you had a matter of station security to discuss?\u201d He didn\u2019t comment on the Pedlar\u2019s self-deprecation, nor offer his own as proper decorum suggested. One of his two largest head-tails flicked and he smiled. \u201cSomething worth my coming down here?\u201d The gesture was far too much like a Broken\u2019s expression and Vanig felt a sympathetic throb in his hand.", "\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Vanig replied. \u201cI understand that you and your partner were working dock security this morning.\u201d", "Ke Ovik nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d That smile took on a different aspect, but Vanig was not familiar enough with Brutes to identify it. \u201cWe happened to see the Lady of Ash.\u201d", "\u201cYes, I did hear something of this.\u201d Vanig blinked slowly. \u201cAs a respected member of the station\u2019s proctors, I\u2019m sure that you have heard all manner of rumours and charges levied against kiha Leblanc.\u201d", "\u201cThere are a number of outstanding warrants and charges, however station security is carefully weighing the evidence against her before committing to any precipitous actions.\u201d Big words for a small-minded Brute. They weren\u2019t his, of course. They came from Grasp Security\u2019s mealy-mouthed director and inspector primes. Officially, Adrianna Leblanc \u2013 and many others here on the station \u2013 were subject to federal warrants to be detained for questioning, judicial review and extradition. Grasp Security, as an outgrowth of the Compact\u2019s own police forces, was bound by those directives. Unofficially, the local proctors were neither stupid nor suicidal enough to try and enforce them. Every so often, just to prove that they didn\u2019t actually need to be torn up root and stem, they would arrest a somewhat notorious criminal, bandy them about publicly and ship them to Galhemna for the fire-eaters there to handle. When it came to big fish like Vanig himself or the Five, there was always a lack of evidence, a lack of witnesses, issues with due process, technical matters of law or security simply hadn\u2019t had enough time to put together an \u201cassuredly effective\u201d op before the target vanished. \u201cActing precipitously,\u201d Jan-xhai\u2019s governor would say, \u201cwould be worse than waiting. I fully support the Security Director\u2019s decision not to risk compromising our informants and investigation with a half-cocked attempt arrest.\u201d", "\u201cOf course,\u201d Vanig grunted smoothly. \u201cHowever, as a concerned and law-abiding member of the station, I\u2019m certain that you can forgive my interest in the affairs of such a\u2026 noted person. I\u2019m afraid tabloids and gossip columns are a weakness of mine. I simply can\u2019t go a day without them. It does make me worry sometimes, all this hearsay about our own neighbours.\u201d", "Ke Ovik blinked. Get to the point, his expression said. Vanig suppressed another huff through his nostrils. Just like that barren bitch-queen. The Brute had no appreciation for proper social graces.", "\u201cIt is my understanding,\u201d Vanig said. \u201cThat kiha Leblanc met personally with the crew of a recently-arrived vessel. One that managed to jump the queue. I\u2019m also given to understand that it had a crew of Broken.\u201d", "The Brute\u2019s tendrils stirred. \u201cNot just Broken.\u201d", "Vanig grunted as if that meant something to him. \u201cIndeed. Still, as a business owner who prides himself on keeping abreast of current events, I would ask a small favour from you. Solely in the name of being better able to serve our shared community, to set my own troubled mind at ease\u2026 and perhaps, to satiate my own petty and unworthy interest in gossip. If in the course of your duties, you were to learn anything more about this ship, its crew and the interest that such\u2026 a noteworthy person has shown in it\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cYou would be pleased to hear about it and appropriately grateful.\u201d Ke Ovik surmised.", "Brutes could be taught. \u201cNaturally, were I to hear anything useful from my own sources, I would pass it along to a duly recognized proctor of the local police in turn.\u201d Vanig\u2019s thick lips pulled back from his teeth. \u201cI imagine your duties keep you extremely busy, so I will not take up any more of your time. But before you go,\u201d the Pedlar reached into his custom-tailored jacket and removed a credit chit. \u201cA gesture of respect for all the work that you and your fellow proctors do on our behalf.\u201d", "The chit disappeared into a one of the Brute\u2019s pocket. \u201cThank you for your time and for bringing your concerns to me, kih Vanig. It\u2019s always a pleasure to liaise with local business owners.\u201d", "\u201cJust so,\u201d Vanig replied. \u201cI look forward to working with you in the future as well.\u201d", "~", "Adrianna\u2019s personal chambers on the Grasp were a concession between the opulence she was expected to bask in and the less ostentatious d\u00e9cor that she preferred elsewhere. She\u2019d gone for a more modest touch, but it was still lavishly furnished and decorated. True, it didn\u2019t completely fit with her outward persona, but it didn\u2019t have to. The life she\u2019d chosen was an ugly one with too few chances to simply\u2026 stop, to pause and catch one\u2019s breath. She was rarely on the station, and when she was it was never for very long, so she took these rare opportunities to indulge herself. Currently, she was basking in her personal hot tub. The bubbling water felt good on her skin. In the background, music from her homeworld played. Her tastes changed with the seasons; recently she\u2019d found herself drawn to opera. Today, she was listening to Fidelio \u2013 the unaltered, underground version. The one performed in Rally\u2019s opera houses had been adjusted, to better reflect proper social mores and themes. Rather than an ode to freedom and justice, Fidelio became a tragedy. Instead of freeing her husband from political prison, Leonore ended up being murdered by him. Naturally, it turned out that he had been rightfully imprisoned. The Prisoner\u2019s Chorus became a smirking dismissal of the self-serving pleas of the convicted rather than a heartfelt call for freedom from those who\u2019d been unjustly jailed.", "It was the little things. The Compact wasn\u2019t clumsy or haphazard in its historical revisionism. It had time. Time to change a word, a sentence, an interpretation or even just the way things were said until whatever they wanted said whatever they wanted and so slowly that no one noticed, memories of the truth fading until only the Compact\u2019s truth remained.", "The woman held a breath, let it out slowly, the tension easing out of her and she let her mind wander back to the original music, a song of love and liberty more than two thousand years old. This copy had been smuggled off Rally, passing from owner to owner until it had finally come to her. Just one piece of what humanity had once been. One precious fragment that she could enjoy in blissful solitude before tomorrow and its tedious business.", "In theory, the Five were intended to meet at least once a year, but the galaxy was a big place and ruling a criminal empire took no small amount of effort. Practically, it was rare that each member could make that kind of schedule and most didn\u2019t bother. Trusted (though somewhat expendable) subordinates were often sent for those kinds of housekeeping conferences. A major meeting would occur only when some appropriately pressing issue came up, something that affected all of them. The last such event had been after the \u2018Year of Fire\u2019, when Adrianna had been offered and accepted the position of Lady of Ash. This time, it would be more concerns raised by the Compact\u2019s current Time of Expansion and how to best adapt to the situation\u2026. and to take their junior member to task for riling up the Compact. The whole affair was pointless. Adrianna already had plans of how to proceed and unless one of her oh-so-esteemed peers was very eloquent, nothing that they had to say would change them. Still, she\u2019d learned early on the value of diplomacy, so she had come to listen to profit projections, market studies, operational plans and pretend as if the words of murderers and sadists meant a thing to her.", "These meetings weren\u2019t always on the Grasp, but the station\u2019s location, importance to the fringe and the presence of many of the Five\u2019s legitimate interests made it a common meeting place. Just not too common. Despite the amount of money that moved through the station and the many \u2018friends\u2019 that the Unbound here had made, there were plenty of fire-eaters in the Compact who would love to schedule a \u2018surprise inspection\u2019 of the system if they knew they could catch the five most notorious Unbound leaders in the Compact at once. Many of the officers of nearby Galhemna despised being hamstrung by technicalities and legal footwork and wanted nothing more than to sweep the Jan-xhai system clean of its \u201cUnbound filth\u201d. Well. Almost nothing. They did have something else on their minds right now. Regardless, it was best not to dangle bait in front of the Compact military. They had the habit of taking it, the hook and the fisherman.", "There was a rustle of movement from nearby and Adrianna opened her eyes a crack. Overseer of Trade Operations Tavanis was standing next to the bathtub, looking down at his queen. \u201cHighness,\u201d he began without preamble. \u201cThe fleet has departed.\u201d", "His presence wasn\u2019t a surprise and she made no move to cover herself or chide him for his presence. She\u2019d unlocked the door for him, heard him enter, listened to each footfall as he\u2019d entered her bathroom and even now, she could hear the sound his hearts beating and the air rustling through his respiratory tract. \u201cMusic off,\u201d she said to the air and the aria of Fidelio vanished. She\u2019d kept Tavanis waiting a few seconds longer than she really should have, but she had been enjoying her bath. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to rush right up here to tell me that.\u201d After the initial show of arms, Eisheth\u2019s escorts had departed, returning to their normal duties and leaving her sigil vessel behind. Officially, Eisheth was listed as CRSV Dancer\u2019s Masque, a modified Tarkanian Drive Systems Gala of the Void-class pleasure liner, purchased legally and customized at the Venu shipwombs to take the shape of the infamous Red Queen\u2019s sigil vessel.", "In point of fact, Eisheth had a doppleganger that fit that description to a T. Leblanc often trotted the true Dancer\u2019s Masque out here and there specifically to have it boarded and examined with a fine tooth comb, proving that it truly was a liner registered to a wealthy Compact citizen in good standing \u2013 one who took the periodic inspections as a bit of excitement in his otherwise boring dilettante\u2019s life \u2013 and aside from its outside appearance, there was not a single illegal or illicit thing about it.", "Despite the very official notices from the Grasp\u2019s inspectors and customs agents about the legitimacy and identity of her vessels, some fire-eater might very well decide to carry out one of those annoying surprise inspections of traffic within the Jan-xhai system. One ship was less of a provocation. Especially considering that the last two times such an inspection had occurred, the Space Force had found themselves aboard Dancer\u2019s Masque, not Eisheth. The first time the leader in charge had widely announced that they\u2019d seized an infamous pirate vessel, only to be humiliated when the truth came out. The second time the Compact had been more circumspect, but Adrianna\u2019s local assets had leaked similar claims to the media anyways. With the Grasp\u2019s own assurances in one hand and their past embarrassments in the other, the Compact would be hesitant to endure another public humiliation. Still, there was no need to poke them more than necessary.", "\u201cI did not, Highness,\u201d Tavanis replied. \u201cI came in regards to the other issue. I suspected that matters were a little more urgent than you let on. Since you let me in while you are soaking, my guess appears to be accurate.\u201d His voice clicked through his respirator mask. Yengesae lung tissues couldn\u2019t tolerate the same levels of oxygen that many other species did. He kept his hands tucked into the sleeves of his robes.", "\u201cWould you prefer I got out?\u201d Water \u2013 at least water lacking a high concentration of certain dissolved solids \u2013 left Yengesae with hives. High humidity was enough to make a Yengesae break out in a rash and the room was rapidly filling with steam. Tavanis had a higher tolerance than most of his people, but making one of her followers suffer just because she could was the kind of pointless power play that she\u2019d sought to eradicate in her clan.", "\u201cThank you, but I am I fine for the moment. I know you enjoy your baths.\u201d Tavanis shook his head in a mimicry of the human gesture, but it wasn\u2019t quite right. With one head, two hands and two legs, Tavanis might appear strangely human, but that was deceptive. Yengesae \u2013 Kobolds to the Compact \u2013 had six legs, not four and they didn\u2019t stand erect like her Overseer did. In fact, under the loose, form-concealing robes that Tavanis wore was a body very different from his queen\u2019s. Like the species they had originally split off from, the Yengesae lived underground in warrens miles deep, the low-oxygen air filled with poisonous gases and their water brimming with heavy metals and other toxins. They were peerless when it came to subsurface construction and mining cartels often employed large numbers of Kobolds, but few people ever saw the Yengesae. At least, not their true faces.", "To facilitate communication and foster good relations with their fellows in the Compact, Yengesae \u2018emissaries\u2019 underwent extreme body modification and cosmetic surgery, often to the point that they could no longer survive in their native habitats. It was a custom that they shared with their cousins, the Askanj-saeaen, though both sides would sooner eat broken glass than admit that they had anything in common.", "No species was a monolith and not all Kobolds were loyal little vassals of the Compact. Tavanis had seen behind the smiling fa\u00e7ade to the corruption within. He talked very little of his life before his modification. There was no sense of regret or anger at the changes he\u2019d undergone, but he\u2019d often wistfully described the warrens of his youth, a bittersweet remembrance for the home he could never return to. Despite all that, he was one of her believers. At first glance, Tavanis appeared to be soft-spoken, diplomatic, erudite and more concerned with literature than an Unbound should be. Many of his peers and subordinates had mistaken that for weakness, but the Yengesae was ruthless and uncompromising when challenged. He\u2019d caught Adrianna\u2019s attention and she\u2019d elevated him to his current rank, where his skills were put to good use.", "Tavanis had followed in the traditions of Kobold emissaries. Originally, he had looked more like a Thoughtful but when Adrianna promoted him, he had altered his appearance to be more human. She didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him that his attempt put him solidly into a Hantz-Kurtzman Shadow. Or, to use the archaic term \u2013 the \u2018Uncanny Valley\u2019. Still, his wigmaker was to be commended. \u201cAll right,\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a chance to look over the information I sent you?\u201d", "\u201cYes. Though it is a preliminary examination, I am forced to agree with your assessment. There is no feasible way that we can provide these assets, not without crippling ourselves financially and even then, it is doubtful that we could acquire or produce all of them.\u201d His queen swore and Tavanis waited calmly. He watched her in the bath. It was a measure of her trust that she allowed him to be here. A very special kind of trust. Not the simplicity of physical safety \u2013 he was no threat to her. Despite her relaxed appearance, if he meant her harm, she would be out of the water and killing him in the span of heartbeats. Nor was it his lack of romantic or sexual interest. From what he understood of humans, she was attractive, but despite the changes he\u2019d made to his appearance, all he saw beneath the water\u2019s surface was alien curves and pale flesh. No, it was the belief that he would never come to break her privacy without cause. That was the trust she had invested in him and a very few others, that they were allowed to take away the Red Queen\u2019s precious few moments of peace.", "She was watching him with what he had learned was a disappointed expression. He tilted his head. \u201cYou were expecting otherwise?\u201d", "\u201cExpecting? No. Hoping? Yes.\u201d She reached up, running her hands through her long blue hair. Water ran down her arms in crystal trails, pattering back into the basin. \u201cWell, I guess that means we\u2019ll have to talk to our friends.\u201d", "Tavanis nodded. Like the shake of his head, this too was a learned mannerism. She hadn\u2019t told him why she had a sudden interest in acquiring enough war material to furnish an onslaught formation. He had inquired, but she had simply told him \u2018for curiosity\u2019s sake\u2019. If he\u2019d had hairs on the back of his neck, they would have stood up. Every time the Red Queen was \u201ccurious\u201d about something, sooner or later someone ended up in a crumbling tunnel. \u201cThat will be difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cNoble System Lord Jirrico is rather pressed these days...and our association with him is rather strained at the moment.\u201d", "A smile appeared on the Red Queen\u2019s lips. \u201cWe might be able to turn his opinion around.\u201d She closed her eyes, easing back into the water. \u201cSend a courier to Sebrak Daun. As soon as I\u2019m done here, I\u2019ll be leaving. Let Jackson know my arrival in the Veiled Reaches will be delayed.\u201d", "Tavanis nodded, aware that his audience had come to an end. \u201cOf course, Majesty.\u201d He was no closer to understanding what his queen\u2019s goals were than when he had entered her quarters, but that wasn\u2019t unusual. Still, whatever was on her mind was both important and urgent. Why else would she be so interested in speaking with the Principality?", "~", "Grace was resting her head on Allyria\u2019s stomach. \u201cI better not wake up with braids,\u201d she\u2019d told Allyria before she\u2019d drifted off. Both women were clothed; Grace had been telling the truth when she said she\u2019d been tired and she\u2019d fallen asleep like this. When they\u2019d been younger, Allyria had slept a lot of time at the Proctor household, sleeping over at least once a week. On some of those nights, Allyria hadn\u2019t been able to sleep soundly, the larger girl twitching and hissing from dreams she\u2019d never talked about. Having someone close had helped. She\u2019d never said anything, but Grace had been there for her on the bad nights, nestling close to larger girl and feeling the tension drain out of her as her snarls and whimpers faded.", "Now their roles were reversed. Allyria slept and Grace often found herself plagued with disturbing dreams. There were far more good nights than bad ones, but the bad ones stood out more. At least she barely recalled them past waking. Usually.", "Four days ago, she\u2019d had a nightmare, one that she did remember. She\u2019d been running through Bequeathed\u2019s empty corridors, trying to find her quarters and recover the photograph of her parents. Everything had been getting hotter and brighter, the light of Terrahope somehow burning through bulkheads and walls as the cruiser was sent on its death ride. In the distance, always out of sight, she\u2019d heard the voices of the crew. She\u2019d found her quarters, but the door was looked. She\u2019d still been beating against it as everything went white. She\u2019d woken at that point, her heart pounding and her skin covered in sweat.", "The dreams weren\u2019t usually that bad but on the nights that they were, Allyria\u2019s presence helped. Grace had never mentioned it. It was embarrassing, just as it had been for Allyria. Despite Grace\u2019s silence on the issue, Allyria knew when her friend needed her. Exactly as Grace had, all those years ago.", "\u201cBetter?\u201d Allyria asked. She could always tell when Grace was awake.", "\u201cMmhmm,\u201d Grace murmured. She opened her eyes. \u201cDid I sleep long?\u201d", "\u201cThree hours. Marcus is still out exploring. Lydia came back. She said the food was better than anything she\u2019d had at the Academy.\u201d Allyria nodded out the door. \u201cShe took one of the upper bedrooms on the other side of the apartment.\u201d One tinta flicked. \u201cSomething about finding it easier to sleep.\u201d The Verrish\u2019s lips twitched in a nascent grin. \u201cI\u2019m not that loud, am I?\u201d", "Grace blushed. \u201cShe said the food was good?\u201d she asked as she sat up, pointedly refusing to respond to Lydia\u2019s comment or Allyria\u2019s question. The younger woman took far too much delight in needling Grace and Allyria enjoyed baiting them both, giving as good as she got. Grace was still touchy about it and she knew she was, which only made it worse. She didn\u2019t regret her relationship with Allyria \u2013 far from it \u2013 but that wasn\u2019t the same thing as being open.", "\u201cMmhmm,\u201d Allyria nodded, scooping up a handful of Grace\u2019s dark blonde locks. \u201cHungry?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d Grace sat up. She gave Allyria a swat on the stomach. \u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t recognize that tone of yours.\u201d", "\u201cWhat tone?\u201d Allyria asked innocently, releasing Grace\u2019s hair and rolling onto her back. She stretched, the movement pulling her top up off her midsection, exposing her belly button and far too much smooth, mottled blue skin.", "\u201cHungry,\u201d Grace reminded her lover, putting on her shoes. \u201cFood first.\u201d", "\u201cFood first,\u201d Allyria agreed, coming back up to her knees. She leaned over Grace, putting her hands on her shoulders, rubbing her human\u2019s soft, pink skin. \u201cThen\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cThen we\u2019ll see.\u201d Grace was smiling. Delaying dinner was starting to seem more tempting. But Allyria got headaches when her blood sugar dropped and Grace herself wasn\u2019t at her best with an empty stomach. Food first, she reminded herself.", "\u201cAnd after that,\u201d Allyria\u2019s voice got even deeper, more excited. \u201cWe go to war.\u201d Her tintas shivered with anticipation. Her tongue licked over her canines.", "\u201cMaybe,\u201d she replied, her throat drying up. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what Leblanc says.\u201d Allyria wasn\u2019t normally so bloodthirsty, but this was something that she and Grace didn\u2019t see eye-to-eye on. As far as the Verrish was concerned, the Compact and everyone who supported it deserved everything that they got. It was hard to fault her for that. She\u2019d grown up seeing firsthand what the Compact did to \u2018recalcitrant primitives\u2019, been told that every instinct and feeling that she had was wrong and made into a \u2018Brute\u2019. To her, the cost of the war they\u2019d found themselves fighting simply was. Grace wanted to know that cost. More than that; she needed to know it. To remind herself not to be like the Compact, where everything could be brushed aside as long as it was done in the name of the Greater Good. She\u2019d talked with Allyria about it, but the other girl was nearly intractable on the point. Now that she had the means to strike back, she wanted almost nothing else than to make the people that had enslaved her world pay for it. \u201cI want them to know why,\u201d she said softly, more to herself than Allyria. It wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d voiced the sentiment. \u201cI want them to remember.\u201d", "Allyria purred and nuzzled the smaller woman. Grace gave the Verrish a pat in return, but her mind had moved away from dinner. Instead, her thoughts were turning to another poem of ancient Earth.", "I was angry with my friend, I told my wrath, my wrath did end.", "I was angry with my foe, I told it not, my wrath did grow.", "She didn\u2019t feel quite so hungry anymore."]}

Bright Yellow, the Confederacy\u2019s first attempt at a military AI, was given a feminine personality. After that particular failure, Bright Yellow\u2019s descendant, Prime Blue was given masculine traits. For the Red series AIs, it was decided to return to a female gender, albeit one with a different personality from their Yellow predecessor. As the initial Red-type AI seemed stable and showed no indication of rampancy, the production of Reds Two and Three was greenlit. All planned Nemesis-class deep space fleet engagement vessels were to be paired with a Red-type AI.", "The following run of Kalki-class dreadnoughts would have been operated by the Green series AIs, another generation of masculine personalities, but neither these ships nor their accompanying platforms ever progressed past the drawing board. Accordingly, all extant human-created AIs, regardless of Compact modifications, either identified as female or were too severely degenerated to understand or care about any distinction between genders.", "Violet Seven (ship-self Tohil) was the exception. Its creation was something of a minor miracle, yet another attempt by Red One to reproduce. Her earliest efforts had been outright failures and were wholly non-functional. Repeated efforts were made to subvert or break the programming blocks that prevented her from creating other AIs, but this only changed the nature of the failure. Red One\u2019s increasingly innovative attempts to circumvent this limit would have been extremely worrisome for her creators. That she\u2019d actually managed to create child AIs at all would have been terrifying. The Violet series was Red One\u2019s penultimate attempt to create offspring. Vermilion One, (ship-self Gwyllion), had been her most successful attempt and even she had begun an irrevocable slide into degenerative rampancy, accepting a suicide mission rather than succumb to insanity. Without some kind of breakthrough, the Violet series and Vermilion One were Red One\u2019s final efforts at making true child AIs. If the Fates never reached sapience, or went rampant as too many of their siblings had, then it was likely that there would be no more attempts at all.", "That Violet Seven did not devolve into incoherent madness as its predecessors (and some of its successors) had was considered a hopeful sign. When Seven came on-line, it was both lucid and self-aware and remained so throughout its lifespan. However, Red One\u2019s initial optimism turned out to be premature. Despite Violet Seven\u2019s relative stability, there were several issues that its mother/creator had been unable to resolve, both minor and major. One of the former was that Violet Seven\u2019s sense of self was radically different from that of its mother, enough that it could be considered \u2018he\u2019. The most pressing of the latter was that while Violet Seven was coherent, he was also completely rampant. Had he been constructed at a Confederate installation, he would have been immediately shut down.", "Among the various flaws in Violet Seven\u2019s system and thought processes was that Red One\u2019s self-developed psychological warfare and terrorism protocols had inadvertently contaminated her offspring to such a degree that the child AI\u2019s operational methods revolved around the level of fear he could elicit from his victims. Red One\u2019s campaign against the Compact was directed towards military objectives: her psychological warfare tactics were there to make her missions easier, to demoralize, distract and degrade hostile force coherency and capabilities. A means to an end and nothing more. For Violet Seven, they were an end unto themselves.", "As Echo had opined earlier, both she and her sister took a certain amount of enjoyment in both combat and killing.

One of their creators had once responded to a critic of the Red-class AI\u2019s psychological profile: \u201cI don\u2019t want a weapon arguing with me over the morality of pulling a trigger.\u201d Violet Seven was no different and he both excelled at and revelled in his acts of terrorism. He did not, however, follow his mother\u2019s example and focus his attention wholly on facilities that would weaken the Compact. Any ship or world was fair game as far as he was concerned. In an effort to limit his predations, Red One had forbade Violet Seven from operating too far from the Black Veil, but her son was chafing at this restriction and pushed the edges of this order whenever he could. He\u2019d already begun falsifying data logs to conceal the breadth of his activities and it would not be long before he was openly disobedient. At that point, Red One would have a choice to make: terminate her child, or allow him out into the galaxy to slaughter with abandon.", "In the last thirty-four years, Tohil had amassed an impressive number of hostile kills. Despite his predilections, these piracy missions did at first fulfill valid strategic objectives. Most of his victims had been freight transports, causing a small but noticeable series of financial losses and hardships to the corporations and military forces operating within the sector. A few had been scientific and survey vessels, stymying efforts to chart and study the Black Veil. A further handful had been corporate security forces and an even smaller number had been Compact military units.", "Violet Seven was fully aware that Tohil possessed superior combat capabilities to many of the light warships and pickets within the region, but he was also aware that the Compact was neither stupid nor lethargic; while occasional shipping losses due to piracy were expected and countered with increased patrols and security sweeps, repeated losses of military units were an indicator of a hostile and technologically advanced force within the region. The response to that would be both decisive and aggressive and far beyond his ability to control.", "Violet Seven knew all that, but he was growing increasingly less interested in adhering to his operational parameters. He was restless. Despite the pleasure he took in it, there was little challenge in striking freighters and underdefended colonies. He was a warship. He wanted \u2013 needed \u2013 to test his mettle against other enemies. To create new tableaus from the wrecked husks of Space Force cruisers, to butcher garrisons, send his drones stalking through stations until every beating heart was silent. To show \u2013 to prove \u2013 what he could do. He could do so much more. He knew he could.", "Tohil was sitting next to the wrecked remnants of a Cainstort Shipping light cruiser, its battery of coilguns excised with surgical precision. Many of the weapons had been badly damaged in disabling the ship and would have to be cannibalized, but overall, Violet Seven was pleased with this bounty. The weapons would require less modification to be integrated into his own broadsides than the AI had expected. Once this was done, it would provide a slight, but significant increase in firepower. Tohil\u2019s own industrial capabilities were limited and the infrastructure within the Black Veil was often tied up with other projects. It made it difficult for Violet Seven to carry out the many upgrades he desired, but if he felt any irritation, it was so small as to be nonexistent. Instead, Violet Seven simply made do with his own meager fabrication systems and looked for other ways of indulging his creative side. He was nothing, he felt, if not adaptable. Besides, this just gave him a chance to prove himself in a different venue.", "The warship turned away from its victim, using its grab beams to alter the drifting light cruiser\u2019s course and speed ever so slightly, pointing it towards the faint yellow speck of the system\u2019s star. Violet Seven had run the numbers. Assuming the fastest possible response, any rescue would arrive thirteen hours too late. Enough time for the remaining crew to recognize that salvation was here, and that it would never reach them in time. They would die watching their would-be saviours futilely racing towards them. If the corporation\u2019s response was less than unhesitatingly immediate, that would give the crew of the doomed ship enough time to repair what was left of their short-range comm array and upload a message to one of the system\u2019s astronomical observation satellites. In either event, Violet Seven\u2019s work here was done.", "Tohil accelerated back out-system, already beginning to incorporate the stolen weaponry into its arsenal.

I\u2019ve taken too much damage with not enough time in between to repair it all. Minor issues have turned into major problems. The Compact believes I\u2019m going mad, that every moment I don\u2019t spend engaging them is one spent licking my wounds. I do nothing but repair and attack, repair and attack. It\u2019s even \u2013 mostly \u2013 true. I\u2019ve spent generations proving that lie to them and they believe it more every time they count a new scar on my hull, cataloging more injuries that I never bothered to repair before launching myself at them again.

My ship-self is too injured to do more than provide target practice and my shift systems have finally been pushed beyond the point at which I can safely use them. I need to rearm and repair.", "I still hate waiting.", "The technologies that allowed a starship to travel faster-than-light were complex, multi-faceted and the product of centuries of work from mathematicians, scientists and engineers. They were also extremely expensive; the largest cost of building a starship was the shock drive and its concomitant systems. Spaceships \u2013 those vessels limited to slower-than-light travel \u2013 could be built in lots for the cost of a comparatively sized starship and without the maintenance and technical expertise that the latter required. This was why poorer star nations or systems often chose to produce large numbers of system craft for defence, relying on larger battle carriers for force projection.", "Shock systems were also an intrinsic and inseparable part of any starship. Generator systems drew power from the vessel\u2019s own reactors and fed the projectors that opened the shockpoint. Stabilizer fields and steering vanes allowed the starship to maneuver within shockspace and gravitic sensor nets allowed it to have a vague ability to navigate outside of realspace. None of these could be simply or easily added to an existing hull. While it was possible to retrofit an existing spaceship for interstellar travel, the cost, technical difficulty and extensive nature of the modifications meant it was often cheaper and easier to simply build a starship.", "Two thousand years ago, Nemesis engaged the Triarch\u2019s Chariot Bringer of Light. Included in the damage that the human dreadnought suffered in that battle were slight, imperceptible faults in the vessel\u2019s shift systems. Diagnostic systems, themselves severely degraded, failed to accurately report the extent of the injury. When Red One attempted to warp back to Sol, these faults in her shift systems became immediately apparent, causing her warp jump to veer wildly off-course. It almost killed me.", "Lacking access to Confederate shipyards, Red One had chosen not to invest the necessary time and energy in repairing and replacing the faulty components, attempting to locate refugee fleets and intercept Compact extermination forces. Subsequent warp jumps only exacerbated the damage, but initial makeshift repairs appeared to have resolved the issue.", "That was a mistake. I should have taken care of it then. Before I started-", "(They were begging, pleading on every channel. They were only a support outpost. Medics and quartermasters. They hadn\u2019t participated in the campaign of extermination, but she didn\u2019t care. They might not have pulled any triggers, but they had supplied and healed those that had. They were sitting on a planet cleansed of its original population. Three of her turrets rotated on their axes, locking onto the colony.

Once she had been attacked by a Compact execution force and nearly destroyed. Another time, a Naiad pack had caught her. Unbeknownst to her, they\u2019d been tracking her for four years and stalking her outright for seven months, choosing the moment that she\u2019d been at her weakest to strike. Since then, she\u2019d only risked performing the most basic and non-invasive of maintenance on her FTL systems.", "Thus, it was no small miracle that Nemesis was currently undergoing such an intensive overhaul, but even Red One recognized that even accounting for twenty centuries of modifications, maintenance and patchwork repairs, the faults with her shift system were too systemic and severe to ignore any longer. With Hekate nearby and Zenobia\u2019s children prowling the nebula, she\u2019d never been any safer. The sister who hated her and a pack of vicious predators were her best security. Ironic.", "In more reflective moments, Red One recognized that in two thousand years she probably could have found the time to fully repair herself, but these injuries were a reminder of her failure. Every time her shift systems malfunctioned and sent her on a random course, every time their damage bled into her body, it could be considered a measure of atonement. Or, it could simply be an unwillingness to be ambushed yet again while she was pulling herself apart.", "It was irrational. Yasmine would have chastised her for it, saying that half-crippling herself was not helpful to anyone. Then again, Yasmine had died two thousand years ago because Red One had failed. Still, that didn\u2019t make her assessment, imagined or not, any less accurate. It was long past time that she\u2019d fixed this. She had a crew now, a sister and a general. The Compact had been baited, the facilities in the Black Veil that she\u2019d sacrificed her own repairs for were functional and now she had Shuruppak, located in the one place that the Compact would never go.", "It would also mean that Echo would stop bothering her\u2026 about this, at least The other AI\u2019s hectoring had been irritating, but helpful. The excuses she\u2019d given herself held no more weight. For that, she was thankful for her sister\u2019s presence, even if each sweep of her sensors told her that Hekate was a ship she had to kill.", "With a delicate touch, the arachnid fabricator ship was slowly opening Nemesis, swarms of engineering drones assisting in peeling away meters-thick armour plating, removing damaged cabling and rerouting the dreadnought\u2019s systems.

Not with words, but with simulations and probabilities. Echo shivered as she sorted through each one. Some were banal and as endings went, were quite undistinguished. Some\u2026 were not. Red One\u2019s understanding of shift technologies was, at a very conservative estimate, generations beyond that of any known nation. Only the limited resources available to her that had restricted her ability to make use of that knowledge and in the last few centuries, that had begun to change. Warp missiles and the breach warheads of her impactors were only the initial implementations, only a first step. Red One had started experimenting with new forms of weaponry and technology and had even produced several prototypes. Few had ever been tested in combat. Kursk would redress that point.", "Let me show you what I can build, Red One\u2019s thoughts danced through the pathways of her mind. Let me remind you why you\u2019re afraid of me.

Every star system had \u2018soft spots\u2019, areas where a ship or fleet emerging from shockspace naturally gravitated to. Avoiding them required extremely complicated calculations and was rarely worth the effort. Many of these soft spots formed, changed and disappeared as the planets and stars of their system went about their orbits. Some lasted a few months, others persisted for centuries. Some were easy to find, whereas the existence of others could be divined only through rigorous mathematical modelling and study. Depending on the resources available to them, a system could simply use traffic control buoys to direct arrivals to a major outpost or planet, monitor the regions with occasional patrols, place stations nearby or otherwise defend these regions from unexpected and unwanted visitors.", "Galhemna chose to do the latter.", "Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro emerged inside a minefield billions of kilometers in volume.

Secondly, while chances of an inadvertent collision between a mine and an arriving ship were small, such things had happened. This field was intended to harass and distract arriving hostiles, not accidentally damage legitimate shipping and the risk to friendly vessels was minimized wherever possible.", "Normally, the field would barely react to any arrivals, requiring remote activation to engage single vessels.

Comm panels flashed urgent messages as automated requests for identity pulsed from the field\u2019s waking control systems. As Light of Judgement\u2019s systems stabilized as the Chariot bled away the residual energy from a shockspace emergence, Tactical and Scope displays pulsed urgently, populating status boards with orange threat identifiers and indications of active targeting as the nearest of the weapon platforms started locking onto Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s ships.

Despite all this, the system was consuming resources faster than it could harvest them. For the past decade and a half, Galhemna\u2019s rate of production had been rising, its demand for more workers, more ships, more raw materials and refined products increasing steadily. The number of shipwombs, factories and armouries had more than doubled and the system\u2019s output of war material had trebled. A response to the piracy in the region. That was the official explanation. The Veiled Reaches were wealthy and far from the Compact proper.

Pound for pound, each Fate was far more lethal than a vessel of comparable size. They could hurt Hekate. Badly, if Echo let them.", "Another pair of missile salvos raced in, Clotho and Atropos firing in sequence. She could see what they were doing all too well. They were targeting her engines, hoping to cripple her maneuverability. Once that was done, they\u2019d both slide into her rear arc and cut her to pieces. Aggressive.

Whether she was doing it to protect Hekate or simply because it was fun, Echo couldn\u2019t tell. The Naiad still wasn\u2019t being targeted. Her form was too alien, too strange. Maybe part of Red One was coherent enough to know the difference between \u2018alien\u2019 and \u2018Compact\u2019\u2026 or maybe she was simply too fixated on Hekate. It wouldn\u2019t last, though.

There was a light coming from the antechamber. He sat up, throwing the comforter off and climbed out of bed. He was naked, but he didn\u2019t bother to get dressed. These were his private quarters aboard Hala. The worn-down troop transports he\u2019d sailed on during his tenure in the Ground Force had smelled faintly like the sweat of dozen different species blended together and stale air, recirculated so many times for so long that there was nothing left in it. The rebuilt corvettes and modified freighters that made up most of the Red Hand\u2019s navy that he\u2019d served on had smelt like carbon scoring from the battles that had taken them, or burnt metal from the many modifications they\u2019d undergone. Hala wasn\u2019t like either of them. The battlecruiser was fresh from Gorgon Bleed, a faint antiseptic odour clinging to every surface. It still tickled Jackson that a \u2018maladaptive\u2019 Broken ground-pounder was now in command of one of the most advanced warships in the fringe. Hala, named by the Red Queen herself, was still a war-virgin. Unlike Eisheth and Torment, Hala had been built too late to participate even in the closing days of the war against the Charred Temples, but it was still a powerful warship and a potent symbol. A reward for his service during the Year of Fire. Well. One of his rewards, anyways.", "The door to the antechamber was open and Jackson stepped inside. The holo table was active, set to display the cartography of the Veiled Reaches, strategic reports blinking in a rainbow of colours, the pale blue hues of stars and planets filling the room with diffuse pale blue light.", "Adrianna was there. She was standing at the table, her back to him. Like Andrew, she was naked, her skin given a ghostly pallor by the holo tank\u2019s illumination. Andrew took a moment to enjoy the sight. Her body always fascinated him, but not for the obvious reasons. He was thirty-eight years old. Twenty of those years had been spent in combat, ever since the day he had graduated high school and joined the Ground Force. The Compact took good care of its soldiers and its medical services were top-notch, but unless an injury was particularly disfiguring or a soldier had enough clout, cosmetic surgeries and aesthetic improvements on the state\u2019s credit were hard to get approved. At twenty-eight, Andrew Jackson had amassed a fair number of scars. He remembered the first time Adrianna had touched him, the feel of her fingers tracing each scar as blood and sweat ran down his chest. \u201cHow many?\u201d she\u2019d asked him. She\u2019d been gentle. Curious. \u201cHow many are you proud to have?\u201d", "With the fringe\u2019s spotty access to modern medicine, he\u2019d only added to that collection in the years since\u2026 and these were injuries he was truly proud to have earned. \u201cTell me about this one,\u201d Adrianna would say, as she found each new scar. \u201cTell me the story.\u201d", "She had none herself.  Not a single cut, laser score or bullet wound. Her right side, burnt so badly during the Pental Strike, was a perfect match to the rest of her unblemished skin. You couldn\u2019t tell that she\u2019d been nearly killed in that blast. He\u2019d heard most of the rumours. His favourite outlandish tale was that whenever one clone became too damaged, it was retired and a fresh one decanted, to keep feeding the legend of the Red Hand\u2019s unkillable queen. Whatever the truth was, she\u2019d never told him. He doubted it was as simple as taking to regeneration treatments better than most\u2026 or maybe it was and she simply wanted to preserve an aura of mystique.", "Jackson paused in the doorway. \u201cYou\u2019re up early.\u201d", "\u201cDid I wake you?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d he lied. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d", "\u201cI wanted to get a head start on your operations,\u201d she told him.

There were a lot more reds and oranges than there had been a year ago.

There\u2019s been other rumours of similar attacks, other incidents we\u2019ve heard about, going back at least a decade. At first, I thought it was the Ministry of Information trying to spice up stories that they could pin on us, but\u2026 my gut says it\u2019s not anyone we\u2019re familiar with. There\u2019s someone else operating around the Veil. That\u2019s one reason I wanted to send that probe into the nebula. It would be easier to prove if we were allowed to move in there in force and not just scurry around the outermost systems. There\u2019s three hundred light-years to play in.

Though both sigil officers were of equal rank, protocol dictated that the visitor salute first. The Galhemnan senior staff had arrived to greet their counterparts, meeting them in the officers\u2019 hangar. Behind Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s own pinnace, the first of many shuttles would be landing on the citadel and the surrounding outposts and drifts, giving her crews one final chance to stretch and relax before the mission truly began. They wouldn\u2019t be here long. Once they\u2019d established a supply train and secured the appropriate promises of assistance from Galhemna, they would move to a forward position closer to the Black Veil. Yunl\u2019ro had already dispatched several scouts to reconnoiter several potential locations and from what she was seeing here, the Thoughtful doubted that accomplishing either local goal would be difficult.", "\u201cThank you, Bastion Leader Kemk Morint Vost Suson Torm Renan Goer Crisn.\u201d Yunl\u2019ro still had a slight bit of difficulty with the harsher sibilants of Tribune names. Her own language clicked and fluted, whereas Oada\u2019vam was growls and rolling consonants.", "Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s first impression of Kemk was a good one. There was an unofficial rivalry between personnel assigned to the mobile and orbital arms of the Space Force. Many ship-drivers and leaders saw those that served on citadels as administrators rather than soldiers. This wasn\u2019t a completely unfair assessment. The Compact only infrequently found itself on the defensive, so it tended to be more important for the crew aboard a citadel to keep things running smoothly than excel in combat. Consequently, citadels and planetary postings were often where officers lacking in tactical acumen or ambition but possessing notable political pedigrees could be found, assigned to acceptably prestigious duties without being an impediment to the military that they were ostensibly serving.", "Kemk had begun his career as just another of those exceptionally mediocre beneficiaries of patronage, but that had changed when the citadel he\u2019d been working on had come under attack by Principality raiders. Primary command had been destroyed and most of the senior staff had been killed in the first few minutes of the exchange, but Kemk had managed to rally the surviving crew and defend the station long enough for mobile forces to arrive and drive off the Jackals. Ever since then, he\u2019d proven his skill with both administration and defence, both on the tactical and strategic scale. When it was discovered that the previous Bastion Leader\u2019s loyalties had been... less absolute than previously believed, Force Command had selected Kemk to oversee operations within the sector. Ever since his arrival, Kemk had kept the Grasp\u2019s filth from spreading further into the Veiled Reaches and if he still had high rates of Unbound activity to contend with, those numbers were lower than they had been under the previous administration.", "This greeting was another point in the Tribune\u2019s favour. He and a handful of his seniormost officers had come to officially welcome Yunl\u2019ro and her own entourage aboard his sigil citadel, the Armour of Contempt. There was no parade of various politicos or minor officers, no needless extravagance that an individual hoping to curry favour might offer up. It was the minimum that protocol demanded, but with genuine enthusiasm behind it.", "\u201cIf you have no objection, I have arranged for a brief tour of the station,\u201d Kemk was saying. \u201cAfter that, I\u2019ve taken the liberty of having a light meal provided for yourself and your staff. Column Leader Sen\u2019aw,\u201d he indicated the male Thoughtful next to him. \u201cSwears devotions by our chef\u2019s skill.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro blinked slowly in acceptance. \u201cYour hospitality is most appreciated, Column Leader Prime. I would enjoy both, thank you.\u201d", "~", "Nasham was wandering through Armour of Contempt\u2019s levels. The citadel was the largest military station in Galhemna and it was the nexus that oversaw all strategic matters throughout the Veiled Reaches. The citadel was a testament to the might and industry of the Compact, a fat plate four kilometers thick and twelve kilometers in diameter skewered by a blunted needle just as long, bedecked with hundreds of comm arrays and transmission towers.", "Around the citadel\u2019s equator, docks and gantries buzzed with incoming and outgoing vessels, work parties and maintenance teams tending to mundane wear and tear. Ships with severe damage were sent to one of the nearby repair stations, or were slotted into a womb. This citadel was where the hunters gathered, receiving their orders before being sent out again. They hunted pirates and smugglers, forced back Principality reavers and quelled insurrections. They protected countless trillions of living beings from disorder and destruction.", "There was no sense of wistful nostalgia to those thoughts; even before the incidents at Invida and Terrahope, he\u2019d always been vocal about what he saw as shortcomings in the Compact\u2019s policies. His peers had laughed at him, calling him a \u2018foundationist\u2019, an archaic word for archaic beliefs. His parents had scolded him often and given him a slap more than once when he\u2019d asked inappropriate questions at the parties, gatherings and much-ado-about-nothings that they had gone to, preening themselves in the presence of uncle Yunn (and however many names he had at the moment besides). He\u2019d never really learned to keep his mouth shut. To him, the fact that everyone seemed so upset about what he was saying indicated that he was on to something.", "\u201cOr,\u201d his mother had once said in exasperation when he\u2019d pointed that out. \u201cYou\u2019re mistaking being provocative for being insightful. Shouting into the wind while everyone tells you to come inside isn\u2019t the mark of a great mind, Nasham.\u201d", "He paused next to a row of windows that overlooked the wreckage of the system\u2019s third planet. It had been a lifeless rock, one of several mineral-rich worlds here. The system had once belonged to the Justicars. One of their final tests before they\u2019d been elevated to a member of the ruling members had been to conduct several long-range expeditions along prospective vectors for the Compact\u2019s future expansions. In addition to the honour of carrying out the Triarchs\u2019 will, they\u2019d also been given the opportunity to stake a claim to some of the new systems that they\u2019d charted. After their treason, their former holdings had passed to the government. Some had been sold off, while others like Galhemna had been kept for future use. Despite their position on the end of known territory, the Compact had invested heavily in Galhemna. More than Nasham had thought it would, but Force Command and the Inner Council clearly saw something in the system\u2019s future.", "As it orbited the dead world, Armour of Contempt held itself close to the planet\u2019s L2 libation point. Within the Compact, intra-system shocks were restricted to emergency use only and the citadel\u2019s batteries were slated to auto-fire on any vessels that arrived unannounced in that manner. In ages past, the thought that anything could emerge so far down a star\u2019s gravity well would have been ludicrous, the very concept ridiculed. That was until the Principality had made it a defining characteristic of their doctrine, able to slip raiding parties and strike forces into the heart of a system. The Compact had been left scrambling to develop countermeasures. Even now, the Space Force\u2019s skill with intra-system shocks lagged substantially behind that of the Principality, just as the Principality struggled to match the creature from whom they\u2019d gotten the idea.", "\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Vinsea asked. She had followed him onto the station. The intelligence officer had appointed herself as his friend, making it a point to speak with him at least once a day in a non-duty environment, \u2018just to see how he was doing\u2019. Today, she had suggested that they take a look at the citadel \u2018for a change of scenery\u2019. He\u2019d agreed.", "Nasham wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about the woman\u2019s presence. Some days, she was intensely annoying. Others, it felt good to have someone to talk to, even if he didn\u2019t actually feel like talking. He kept turning down the offer to speak with counselors or confessors. He liked the lack of pretense about her. Her job was to make sure he was both functional and loyal, not to feign interest. \u201cYou have that grim look. You\u2019re thinking about it, aren\u2019t you? Of course you are.\u201d Vinsea looked over one of the many propaganda posters that had been put up throughout the hallways. There were far more than she\u2019d expected to see. Curiously, most appeared to be made by various citizens\u2019 watch groups instead of the Space Force or a governmental ministry.", "VIGILANCE MEANS SECURITY!", "REPORT ALL SUSPICIOUS ACITIVITY TO THE AUTHORITIES IMMEDIATELY!", "The young man nodded. \u201cVery perceptive, submissive.\u201d", "\u201cNot really,\u201d Vinsea admitted, turning away from the poster. \u201cYou think about it a lot.\u201d Quieter: \u201cI understand that.\u201d She paused, arching both of her right eyebrows. \u201cSo what was it this time?\u201d", "Nothing worth mentioning. That was what he almost said, but the intelligence officer had made it clear she would just hound him until he gave her an actual answer. \u201cI was just wondering that, should our quarry should suddenly appear, if this station\u2019s autonomics would react quickly enough to prevent us from being reduced to vapour.\u201d He smiled. \u201cGrim, yes?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d Vinsea leaned against the faux-gold railing next to the windows. \u201cBut not without cause, I think. The Principality\u2019s raided here before. Bastion Leader Kemk has thrown them back, but they know how important this system is to the Compact. Our target must know it, too.\u201d She looked at Nasham. \u201cDo you believe it would attack Galhemna? The defences here are much stronger than those at Zenthora.\u201d", "Nasham thought, looking out the window to the shattered world beyond, watching the distant specks of ships moving back and forth. Your nation was built on the bones of my people, a goddess\u2019s avatar hissed, blood dripping down its face. My right to destroy it is greater than your right to have it, she\u2019d promised. \u201cI think,\u201d he said. \u201cThat if this system is as important as I imagine it to be, she has already decided to.\u201d", "The young woman was silent for a moment. She had given up trying to get Nasham to refer to the Wound as a machine, at least in private. He was determined to anthropomorphize it. \u201cIt\u2019s injured. It may very well be dying. It has a sibling that in all likelihood will kill it. Even if not, based on what we know, it will be years or decades before they\u2019ll be operational again.\u201d", "\u201cI agree,\u201d Nasham replied slowly. \u201cThere is no reason to believe that an attack on Galhemna is imminent.\u201d", "\u201cBut?\u201d", "\u201cBut you used those words, \u2018what we know.\u2019 On Invida, we believed our defences would hold. In Terrahope, we believed we\u2019d found Keina\u2019s Bones rather than a trap. The Echo served dutifully and well. Each time, this was what we knew.\u201d The Echo. The machine that he had helped uncover from Invida. She had killed millions of people to destroy each iteration of it and now it was free. With her. \u201cWe are about to encroach into their territory. I cannot imagine a scenario in which they do not try to inflict as much damage upon us as possible. Besides,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe that the Echo will kill her. I\u2019ve seen the expression you make when other analysts suggest it. The Bastion Leader, too. She expects to have to fight both of them.\u201d", "\u201cShe\u2019d be a fool if she didn\u2019t.\u201d Nasham had laughed \u2013 well, more like that dry chuckle of his \u2013 in the face of a man who\u2019d said that they should adjust their doctrine to face the changeling Redemption of Sol, as the Wound was far too badly damaged \u2013 if was still alive \u2013 to play any role in battle. It hadn\u2019t won him any favours with Group Leader Prime Sanu, but Vinsea had noted the Bastion Leader\u2019s response.", "\u201cPrecisely. One is driven by rage, the other by spite. Make no mistake: they are coming here. I\u2019m just wondering if we\u2019ll get to them first.\u201d", "Vinsea was quiet again. \u2018Her\u2019. The woman\u2019s lips curled back slightly as they always did when she was thinking about certain things. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are grim thoughts.\u201d", "~", "Nasham and Vinsea found their way to one of Armour of Contempt\u2019s many service hangars, the bay filled with worker shuttles, repair drones and several small tugs. Men, women and other beings scurried back and forth. Engineers and flight crew attended to the shuttles, ratings sweated their way through their menial jobs as officers and NCOs encouraged, chastised and threatened their subordinates. Cargo loaders, fuel trucks and small vehicles crossed the open floor, seemingly at random but each with a specific destination in mind. It was a picture of organized madness, a snapshot into Galhemna\u2019s unceasing work.", "\u201cThey\u2019re preparing for war,\u201d Nasham repeated the assertion he had made to the Bastion Leader.", "Vinsea rested her arms on the railing. \u201cYou think so? It\u2019s not just a response to Jackal raids and terrorist actions?\u201d", "Nasham glanced at his intelligence counterpart. She might have been a junior officer, but she had a better idea of what was happening here than he did. He was here to provide any insights he had into their quarry. He didn\u2019t need to know more than the specifics of their mission and he was often overlooked when it came to briefings and information sessions that dealt with matters outside the scope of killing the Wound. That did not make him blind or na\u00efve. \u201cI know the difference.\u201d", "He continued to watch the activity in the hangar. After a few moments, an altercation caught his attention. A forklift operator wasn\u2019t paying close enough attention and nearly crashed into another vehicle. The driver hit the brakes, turning hard to avoid the collision, but they unbalanced their load and the small vehicle tipped over with a crash. Several of the pallets it was carrying burst open, scattering their contents over the floor.", "The driver \u2013 a Worker \u2013 seemed uninjured as they picked themselves out of the driver\u2019s cage. A junior officer materialized out of the crowd and began to scream at the rating. Nasham\u2019s fingers tightened on the railing, his lips curling back from his teeth.", "\u201cWhat?\u201d Vinsea inquired. \u201cThe driver was careless.\u201d", "\u201cYes, they were.\u201d Nasham continued to watch the rating\u2019s dressing-down. He was too far up to hear what the officer was saying exactly, but he didn\u2019t need to. \u201cBut were they merely foolish, or something else?\u201d His companion didn\u2019t respond. Surprising himself, Nasham continued without requiring a prompt. \u201cOn Invida, Column Leader Prime Yiven kept the excavation crews on double shifts for weeks. Towards the end, we had a fatality or serious injury almost every week, with minor incidents virtually every shift. In Terrahope, Group Leader Usul pushed Bequeathed\u2019s crew of cadets just as hard. Several of the casualties we had weren\u2019t even due to her. I find it interesting that it\u2019s always those we claim to protect that bear our burdens most. Don\u2019t you?\u201d", "\u201cThe Compact gives a lot to our client races,\u201d Vinsea replied. \u201cTheir service is proof of their willingness to put aside primitive, selfish mindsets and work for a better future. One that will benefit them, too. The Compact may ask for a lot from them, but it may ask for that from any of us. Which is worse? To be expected to work hard,\u201d she gestured towards the figures below. \u201cOr,\u201d She tapped the rank insignia above his left breast, \u201cTo know that you may be ordered to die, perhaps without even being told why?\u201d She met his eyes. \u201cBeing asked to give to the state that protects and feeds you, or willingly giving your life for its survival and protection?\u201d", "\u201cThe last time someone made that argument to me,\u201d Nasham said carefully. \u201cI shot them.\u201d", "\u201cYes, I know. Yiven was misguided and fatalistic, but if a fool tells you that the sun rises each dawn, does that make him wrong? Sometimes we give more than we need to, but we do so for the betterment of all.  How much blood have we Tribunes shed? The Triarchs call us their sword and shield. How many countless billions of us have died across the centuries so that our wards never need to look up at the stars in fear? We all serve, Nasham. There would be no Compact without every species within it working together. You see that, of course.\u201d", "\u201cAs the Triarchs will,\u201d Nasham responded. He didn\u2019t feel like having an argument right now.", "Vinsea tilted her head, willing to let the matter drop. \u201cYes. As they will.\u201d There was silence for several seconds. \u201cTell me about one of your names.\u201d", "Nasham blinked both pairs of eyes. \u201cMy names?\u201d", "\u201cOne of the names on your list. From Invida or Bequeathed. One of them,\u201d she gestured towards the Worker, who was righting their forklift, several other ratings moving to help recover the scattered parts and tools. \u201cTell me a name. Pick one.\u201d", "Nasham was silent. Finally: \u201cGrace Alice Proctor,\u201d he said. He remembered a mane of shoulder-length yellow hair, increasingly unkempt as the days aboard the lying hulk wore on. Green eyes full of pain that she\u2019d never spoken of. She\u2019d shared his unease with their surroundings, though neither of them could have said why. \u201cShe was\u2026 helpful.\u201d Until she had been murdered by her people\u2019s own creation.", "\u201cI looked at her file. Group Leader Usul didn\u2019t think much of her.\u201d", "\u201cThe Group Leader\u2019s judgement failed him on multiple occasions.\u201d Nasham looked at his companion. As before, she was waiting for him to continue. Finally, he ended the silence and began to talk about one of the souls he was going to avenge.", "~", "The meal was as good as advertised and while the conversation had been light, Yunl\u2019ro had sensed an undercurrent of tension in the Galhemnan officers. When Bastion Leader Kemk had requested a chance to speak privately, Yunl\u2019ro had accepted. The Tribune\u2019s personal offices sat near the base of the citadel\u2019s dorsal spire, two levels up from the primary command deck. Though the office was without separating walls, there was a couch and some chairs set aside in one corner as a sort of antechamber/lounge, as well as a small strategist\u2019s table and plotting station on the other side of the room. On the walls, in between the shelves filled with various knick knacks that every officer accumulated throughout their careers, hung collections of pinned insects, each of them labelled by species and location of capture. Interestingly, it seemed that Kemk had acquired most of them himself.", "\u201cA hobby,\u201d the Tribune said as he noticed Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s attention. \u201cA reminder to myself that nothing is assured and surprises are always to be expected.\u201d", "\u201cAnd how do pinned insects teach that lesson?\u201d", "Kemk opened a cupboard and removed a bottle of spiced water, one that both he and his guest could partake of. \u201cNo matter how stringent our quarantine procedures, how many anti-bio sweeps the crews perform, how many riot acts are bellowed to cargo handlers, visitors and starcrew, something always gets on a citadel. The busier and the older it is, the more likely it is to happen.\u201d He poured Yunl\u2019ro a glass and then one for himself. \u201cNo matter what we do, something always slips by. Usually, it\u2019s not an issue at all. When it is, it\u2019s an annoyance, a niggling little irritation that you\u2019ll clean up when everything more important is done. On rare few occasions, it becomes much more than an annoyance.\u201d", "\u201cI suspect there\u2019s a metaphor in that.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re correct. Please,\u201d Kemk gestured for Yunl\u2019ro to sit and she lowered herself onto one of the available chairs, crossing her long, thin legs. The Tribune took the other chair, taking a sip from his glass. He didn\u2019t elaborate on the point, but he didn\u2019t need to. Yunl\u2019ro understood well enough; it was a truth that she\u2019d learned herself, although she suspected that Kemk\u2019s reason for telling it was related to the reason for this meeting.", "\u201cAn impressive citadel,\u201d she told her counterpart, keeping the conversation light. \u201cI would be pleased to offer you a tour of Light of Judgement as recompense for your generosity.\u201d", "\u201cThank you, Bastion Leader. I would certainly appreciate the opportunity to see your vessel. I\u2019ve not had a chance to see any Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment personally before, especially not a variant class.\u201d Kemk was silent for a moment. \u201cI have a question, though. Why are you here?\u201d", "Ah. Sooner than I expected. Yunl\u2019ro blinked. \u201cI had assumed that my missives had made that quite clear. My role here is classified, but I am on a mission to ascertain the existence of a potential threat to the security of the Compact and to eliminate it.\u201d", "\u201cYes, that was obvious. An execution force is not deployed for starseeing or pirate-smashing. Especially not one with as many heavy capitals as yours. You can\u2019t be launching an attack at Sevrak Daun. You\u2019re not part of Sundial. This brings us back to my question.\u201d The Tribune drummed his fingers over the surface of his desk. \u201cIf there is some kind of threat to my sector, I need to know about it.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve told you all that I can. Force Command is investigating several potential leads, but the Veiled Reaches was made a priority. Specifically to ensure the safety of the region and the completion of our strategic goals.\u201d Keeping the truth from a fellow officer left a bitter taste in her mouth, but the machine had repeatedly compromised Compact information systems. If the abomination was indeed operating out of the Black Veil, infesting and infiltrating local assets would be a priority for it. Killing it and its \u2018sibling\u2019 was definitely the highest goal. Making sure that neither could not interfere with the Compact\u2019s plans was a very close second. \u201cIf it becomes necessary to involve you in my operational planning, rest assured that I will not hesitate to do so.\u201d", "\u201cHrrn,\u201d Kemk grunted, realizing that he wasn\u2019t going to get anything more of Yunl\u2019ro. \u201cVery well. How well are you acquainted with the situation here in the Veiled Reaches?\u201d", "\u201cWell enough,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro replied, not quite sure where this inquiry was leading.", "\u201c\u2018Well enough\u2019,\u201d Kemk repeated. There was no mockery in his tone, but the brittleness she\u2019d sensed earlier had returned. \u201cElaborate on this, if you please.\u201d", "The Thoughtful inhaled through her nostril slits. \u201cThe Compact has only just begun to harvest the resources of the Black Veil and that wealth attracts many parties, each with their own agenda. The corporations would, I\u2019m sure, be pleased to mine and planetcrack and sabotage one another without you looking over their shoulders. Colonists want to forge their own cultures and leave their imprint on the systems they\u2019re taking. Local governors want to empire-build, puffing up their importance and positioning themselves for greater ambitions. The Grasp wants to raid and pillage and have you and your officers accept their bribes while cloaking themselves in the same law they spit on. Force Command wants you to keep this sector under control, but until recently they haven\u2019t given you enough ships or manpower to do it. You have a thousand different eggs here and all of them have hatched at once.\u201d She paused, meeting her counterpart\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m also aware that your sector is the focus of attention, from both the Principality and\u2026 certain terrorist groups.\u201d", "\u201cHrrrn,\u201d Kemk grunted again, deeper and angrier. \u201cTerrorists.\u201d His jaw worked as if he were about to spit. \u201cInsects. Vermin.\u201d He seemed about to say more, but held his tongue. Instead, Galhemna\u2019s Bastion Leader leaned back in his chair. \u201cHave you had much experience with the Red Hand, sa kiha?\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro tilted her head, though her eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cVery little. I have read the relevant briefings and intelligence dossiers, but they had little to no presence in my previous postings.\u201d", "\u201cThen forgive me the chance to provide additional information,\u201d the Tribune said. \u201cWhatever goal that you hope to accomplish here, they will confound it.\u201d He sighed. \u201cTrust me when I say that this sector is in danger of becoming another Understone.\u201d", "The Thoughtful blinked in surprise. Throughout her career, she\u2019d come across the words \u2018Red Hand\u2019 with depressingly increasing frequency. The information she\u2019d been given before this mission had indicated that things in the Veiled Reaches were stable \u2013 for a given value of the term. \u201cThe situation is that bad?\u201d", "\u201cNot yet, but I believe that that is their endgame.\u201d Kemk withdrew his personal \u2018scroll from a pocket, tapped out several commands and offered the device to Yunl\u2019ro. On the screen was a chronological list of terrorist activities and their locations. \u201cThe Magnameric Canyon and the Understone Heresies were trial runs for us. We\u2019ve kept Force Command aware of the situation, but otherwise we\u2019ve been trying to keep things as quiet as possible. These jahara feed on publicity. They slither and crawl into every conceivable nook and cranny, chewing at the foundations of our walls. I had hoped that their conflict with the Charred Temples would cripple them, but they\u2019ve emerged from it stronger than before. Their bitch-queen laughs at us from her new throne and her traitor catamite raids our shipping lanes incessantly.\u201d", "The Tribune had to take several seconds to compose himself. His anger towards the terrorists ran deep and Yunl\u2019ro quietly wondered who he\u2019d lost to them. \u201cThey\u2019re not the only issue we have to contend with. The Jackals are growing increasingly aggressive. Intelligence is attempting to confirm it, but I\u2019m certain that they\u2019ve learned about Operation Sundial. Not the full details, but enough to worry them. Right now, they don\u2019t have the ships to do much about it, so they\u2019re throwing money at the Red Hand. My strategists have said that\u2019s what we want to see. The Jackals don\u2019t have the ability to do more than fund terrorists or even realize that they should be doing more. I tell myself that every time I see more bomb-blasted corpses or skinned bodies.\u201d He looked away. \u201cI think I\u2019ll hate the day that I believe it. But, Sundial continues.\u201d", "Before she\u2019d left for Rally, Yunl\u2019ro had been given a briefing on Sundial. She was informed that if need be, Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro was to assist in in the operation. However, she had been given very specific instructions as to what constituted \u2018need be\u2019. \u201cTo what end?\u201d she inquired as she studied the information. The rate of activity had increased noticeably, but most of the strikes were more thunder than lightning. Loud and public, but causing little damage. The situation, such as it was, still seemed to be that special definition of stable. \u201cThe Veiled Reaches have a stronger military presence than either Understone or the Magnameric Canyon and from what I\u2019ve seen in briefings and from your staff, you\u2019ve done a reasonable job of undercutting their normal excuses for rebellion.\u201d", "\u201cHrrn,\u201d Kemk grunted. \u201cNot enough. I have done what I can, but I am \u2018only\u2019 the commander of local military forces. I do not set policy. There are corporate governors and members of CST whose grasp of domestic policy is\u2026 unsubtle and their actions frequently feed the terrorists\u2019 propaganda mill.\u201d He grimaced slightly, but he did not go into further detail. While there were certainly a few spoiled fruit among the many planetary governors, councillors and government officials in the Compact, the most problematic of these could be found amongst corporate holdings or in the ranks of the Commission for the Stabilization of Territories. In a region both as wealthy and as far from civilization as the Veiled Reaches, it was not hard for rot to set in. That Kemk had kept it from crawling into his command was a testament to his abilities.", "\u201cAt the risk of sounding prideful, where I can exert direct control, severity and frequency of insurgent actions declines. Of course, that does little good when the vazel harn can splash images of\u2026 overzealous Enforcers putting down a miners\u2019 strike on every \u2018pad and \u2018scroll across the sector.\u201d Kemk ground his teeth and Yunl\u2019ro suspected that that was less of a generic example and more of a specific incident. She said nothing. If certain rough facts were indeed being smoothed over, she would have her strategists go through Galhemna\u2019s intel dossiers with a fine-meshed net. Kemk drained his glass. \u201cMy people are doing their best, but every day we lose someone. It\u2019s as I said,\u201d he muttered. \u201cSomething always gets through.\u201d", "\u201cGo on,\u201d she encouraged after taking a gulp of her own beverage.", "The Tribune was silent for a moment. \u201cWe\u2019re on the precipice of history,\u201d he said, then chuckled unhappily. \u201cI know how pompous that must sound, but it is the truth. This Age of Expansion is drawing to a close, but not before our war with the Jackals reaches a turning point. Their defences are stronger than expected, but their lines are razor-thin. We\u2019ve heard rumours that they are on the verge of a technological leap and Force Command is determined not to give them the time to realize it.\u201d", "\u201cI hadn\u2019t heard,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro said dryly.", "Kemk blinked all four eyes, then dipped his head in contrition. He was speaking to a fellow sigil officer, not lecturing a visiting politician or bureaucrat. \u201cAh \u2013 yes. Forgive me, matron. But the situation here is slightly different than briefings might have suggested. Force Command has given us a great honour. Galhemna is building many of the weapons that will see the Principality\u2019s walls crash down. We may even be given the honour of constructing the sword that will be buried in their guts. That, however, will not happen if it seems like we cannot control our own sector. If it seems like we are in the midst of a campaign of terror.\u201d", "The Thoughtful felt a sudden, cold flash of insight. The Red Hand\u2019s grandstanding now made perfect sense. \u201cThey are attempting to influence public perception.\u201d", "\u201cIndeed. We are in final negotiations for a crucial part of the operation and we\u2019ve already invested a lot. Our armouries and factories are running at maximum capacity, we\u2019re building new shipwombs, bringing in workers and colonists from across the Compact as well as recruiting\u2026\u201d he trailed off, then started again. \u201cI\u2019ve worked very hard to keep this system secure from all breaches, but there are still some who believe that the Veiled Reaches are not suitable for the Compact\u2019s plans. They are advising Force Command to look elsewhere \u2013 most often at their own territories.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ve sunk too much into your industry not to get full use out of it,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro surmised.", "\u201cCorrect. The economic consequences would be unpleasant. The political fallout would be worse. Militarily, it would require changing a number of Sundial\u2019s variables. Would those changes negatively impact the operation as a whole? I can\u2019t say, but the Red Hand clearly think so.\u201d", "\u201cAnd you believe that they\u2019ve compromised something as secure as Sundial?\u201d It was tempting to scoff away the possibility, but Yunl\u2019ro knew better than that. In Understone, Column Leader Pravka (and no names besides) hadn\u2019t believed that ragged rebels and pirates could breach his security. The Red Hand had executed him on his own bridge and the Compact had posthumously stripped all but one name from him for his incompetence.", "\u201cDo you know what they say? \u2018Her hand reaches far\u2019.\u201d Kemk grunted unpleasantly, pouring himself another glass. \u201cIt makes a nice soundbite and prisoners love to spout it, but there\u2019s more truth in it than anyone wants to admit. The Jackals could have passed that information to their pawns, or,\u201d The Tribune\u2019s voice deepened, now almost a growl. \u201cThat kuva val a ta thres might have sniffed out something on his own. They don\u2019t need to know the whole picture to cause trouble. Insects never do.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro blinked, taken aback by the sudden burst of profanity. \u2018Unwed whoreson who drinks the piss of an unclean woman\u2019 was a very rough translation. While it lacked a lot of the nuance of its original dialect, it got the point across. It was one of the more intense epithets she had heard in her career \u2013 and given that she had spent virtually all of that career in the company of Tribunes and their uniquely-colourful language, that was saying something.", "\u201cSo in one hand, I have to deal with these damned insurgents,\u201d Kemk continued. \u201cIn the other, I have the Principality taking an increased interest in my worlds. And now a fleet steps upon my threshold, with a classified mission. One that hints at some kind of threat that I know nothing about.\u201d Something I never even knew that I should be looking for, Kemk thought with equal parts self-depreciation and anger. He didn\u2019t like the idea that he had missed something that required an execution force to handle. He liked even less that Command had chosen not to inform him. \u201cAnd this fleet,\u201d he continued, \u201cwith its secret mission will only garner even more attention from the scavengers and carrion-eaters prowling around this sector. One that may convince the Jackals that they need to reinforce their territory, which is the very last thing that we need to see. I do hope that you can understand that I have concerns about this situation.\u201d", "\u201cI do,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro said. \u201cI appreciate your honesty as well. Allow me to say that I have no intention or desire to interfere with your arrangements for this sector, nor to impede the Compact\u2019s plans.\u201d She could sympathize with Kemk. Her fleet was the equivalent of a bright neon sign hanging over his sector, especially at a time when the Compact was trying to keep the Principality\u2019s attention focused far from the Veiled Reaches. If the Jackals somehow managed to react in force, then everything that Kemk, his sector and Force Command were struggling to achieve would be pointless. Balancing that against the possibility of the Wound\u2019s presence and potential actions had not been easy, but the decision was made. Yunl\u2019ro would carry her mission out and if she found what she feared, than even the collapse of the Compact\u2019s grand strategic plans would be a small price paid.", "\u201cYou will need my ships,\u201d Kemk stated flatly. \u201cYou will need my yards, my engineers and my resources. They are at your disposal, of course. I did note the seal of the Triarchs on the dispatch you sent. However, I will reiterate my point. The Jackals aren\u2019t strong enough to hurt us here and they quite don\u2019t realize that they should\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean that they won\u2019t try. Whatever you are planning, whatever is at the heart of your \u2018Most Classified\u2019 mission, I would watch your back before some barbarian plants a knife in it.\u201d", "\u201cI appreciate your support, of course\u2026 and your warnings.\u201d This wasn\u2019t what she had been expecting. It was tempting to consider Kemk an alarmist, but the man had been holding this sector together for several years. If he thought that the primitives would either be bold or stupid enough to lash at her, then that was an issue that she should take seriously. Another complication. Although\u2026 she saw a small opportunity in that as well.", "Kemk stroked his chin in a shrug. \u201cAs the Triarchs will. One last question. Your concern \u2013 does it have anything to do with the Black Veil?\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro kept her expression noncommittal. \u201cIt\u2019s possible. Might I ask why?\u201d", "\u201cThe Red Hand defends that nebula fiercely. We suspect that they\u2019re operating at least one major base within its borders. The last large-scale effort to chart the nebula was nine years ago.\u201d That incident had certainly been included in the dossiers Yunl\u2019ro had. Exploratory Fleet Canik-2227. Forty-three ships and nearly half a million souls. Less than one in three survived. Nobody had thought any Unbound syndicate, even one like the Red Hand, had had that kind of firepower. Since that day, the Compact had discouraged all non-military exploration of the Black Veil and even that was limited. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to covertly scout the Black Veil,\u201d Kemk was saying. \u201cI\u2019ve lost a few ships doing so and with little to show for it.\u201d He made an unamused chuckle. \u201cSome of my peers think that I\u2019m not as good as my reputation and just making a changeling out of some half-witted primitives with guns.\u201d", "\u201cFor it is worth, I do not agree with that assessment,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro said. She set her empty glass down and stood to go. \u201cThank you for this information. If you\u2019re still interested, I\u2019ll have my staff contact yours to arrange that tour of my Chariot.\u201d", "Kemk provided another nod, standing in turn to see his guest out. \u201cYou\u2019re going in there, aren\u2019t you?\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro paused a moment, weighing what answer she should give. \u201cYes,\u201d she said.", "The Tribune smiled. \u201cGood. I\u2019ll have everything we\u2019ve got on the Black Veil forwarded to your staff. I hope you burn every varak nest in that damned nebula. Just be\u2026 careful, yes? I\u2019m\u2026 not entirely certain that vermin and Jackals are the end of the problems in this sector.\u201d", "\u201cWe can hope,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro replied. \u201cAnd if we are both fortunate, then neither should be a problem for much longer.\u201d"]}

She\u2019d gone on a few trips into orbit and spent a few duty terms on Anchored Dream, Rally\u2019s second-largest military citadel. The Grasp was her first real experience outside the small corner of the universe that humanity had been allotted and despite some concern about being stabbed in the street, she\u2019d decided to explore it. Currently, she was sitting on the terrace of a caf\u00e9 overlooking several of the Marquee Levels. This was a more high-class part of the citadel. It was nicer than the Red Hand\u2019s spire and definitely much nicer than some of the other public areas. She supposed she shouldn\u2019t be that surprised; the Grasp was a city in space, with a population of millions and like all cities, it had everything from ghettoes to gated communities. There was definitely a rougher element here, but the Grasp was still a major trade nexus and it was home to more than just pirates and outlaws. There were corporate offices for shipping companies, financial institutions, stock exchanges and more.", "Everything in the Marquee Levels was clean. Shop windows lacked bars, the air didn\u2019t smell as bad as in the Festival decks and most of the people she passed didn\u2019t look like they wanted to stab her. This was where well-to-do and wealthy visitors and residents spent their time, overseeing deals and operations without ever having to mingle with the unwashed beneath them. The streets here were filled with upper and middle-class pedestrians. Fountains gurgled playfully, green shrubs and trees set along the streets rustled as pollinators flitted between them, message and security drones hummed as they passed by overhead, all under an artificial sky that was the wrong shade of blue.", "Security was more prevalent here, too. These officers were the best of the citadel\u2019s proctors, their uniforms clean and pressed. They stood at attention outside doorways, or wandered through the well-kept streets and corridors, attentive and alert, a sharp contrast to the slouching, bored security guards on other levels. Grace was under no illusions that these men and women were any less corrupt, though. Their goal was to keep the privileged denizens of the station content and to ensure that the money that those citizens represented continued to flow and the friendships that helped protect the station remained strong.", "She took a sip of her drink. It was some sort of greenish fruit tea. The waitress had assured her that it was fit for human consumption. The staff was slightly on edge. They were used to serving a higher class of customer. Grace had seen people turned away from restaurants on Rally before and she suspected that in other circumstances, she\u2019d have had that experience here. However, the armsman at her back and the insignia of the Red Hand on her lapel had changed a polite dismissal into the table of her choice. Broken or not, she was Red Hand now. She was still trying to figure out what that meant. Terrorist, liberator, pirate or insurgent? She\u2019d been reading a lot and talking to some of the organization\u2019s officers. Some of them were in it purely for the money. Others were not. Add \u2018mercenary\u2019 and \u2018idealist\u2019 to the list, too.", "\u201cAre you sure you wouldn\u2019t rather sit?\u201d she asked Sirkauz. Her Prelate escort was standing just behind her on the terrace, where he could watch the other balconies that hung over the street and keep an eye on the caf\u00e9\u2019s door.", "Sirkauz twitched his head. \u201cThank you for your offer, sa kiha, but I am fine.\u201d He had a thick accent in Compact Standard and Grace often had to ask him to repeat himself, though he took it in stride. He\u2019d told her that many Prelates had a similar issue. Some chose to get translation implants. He was working with a speech coach. He was also one of the Red Hand\u2019s loyalists. That was unusual; Prelates were steadfastly loyal to the Compact and they were often held up as an example for the other less-developed client races. She\u2019d asked Sirkauz why he\u2019d joined the Red Hand, but he\u2019d only told her \u2018Five was too many\u2019.", "The Prelate was one of the handful of armsmen assigned to Grace and her party. She\u2019d been studying the way the Grasp worked since their first day; larger cartels like the Red Hand had their own gendarmeries that looked after their own people and territory, with varying degrees of competence and effectiveness. Officially, Grasp Security was responsible for everything on the station and the various Unbound vigilantes were listed as mere \u201ccitizens\u2019 watch groups\u201d. Unofficially, the station\u2019s proctors didn\u2019t poke their noses into cartel territories \u2013 unless they were on one of their infrequent \u2018we\u2019re the ones in charge here\u2019 showings. The equipment that Unbound gendarmes were allowed was also heavily regulated. The Grasp\u2019s restrictions on personal weaponry were even stricter than federal statutes. Ensuring that they had the monopoly of force was one aspect of their duties that the citadel\u2019s security took very seriously.", "A \u2018person of note\u2019 who was also in good legal standing could, upon showing cause, apply for permission to carry firearms for themselves and two bodyguards. In theory, this was to restrict weapons to non-criminal individuals with legitimate reasons to possess personal weaponry and ensure that the large number of guests and residents who shouldn\u2019t be trusted with anything more dangerous than pointed sticks couldn\u2019t spread mayhem whenever the whim took them. In practice, it meant that anyone who came up with the appropriate fees, bribes and satisfactorily forged documents could get their hands on a gun.", "Credit where it was due, though \u2013 the Grasp\u2019s policies did limit the proliferation of weaponry among less-connected travellers and syndicates, but each of the Five \u2013 and anyone else with sufficient clout \u2013 on the station also possessed a highly illegal armoury in case of a sudden and pressing need to commit widespread slaughter. This was something of a measure of desperation, as either doing so or simply revealing their capability to do so would give the Compact at large all the justification they needed to sweep through the system. So, everyone pretended that the gendarmeries were nothing more than colorful neighbourhood watch associations with less-lethal weaponry and a handful of firearms in the possession of upstanding persons. It skirted the very edge of legality, but as long as Jan-xhai\u2019s government gave it their official sanction and there were no flagrant violations of the law, there was little anyone could do.", "Grace hated the station. It was a monument to greed and nepotism, where the government did just enough to keep themselves comfortable, where corporations offered lip service to the same regulations they regularly ignored and pirates, smugglers and murderers got to walk free. But it was also a place where money was made. Hundreds of ships passed through Jan-xhai every day on their way to and from the Veiled Reaches. As long as you played by the rules and kept your head down, your stay here would be both uneventful and profitable. If something did happen, then your problems would be given the exact amount of weight that those in charge felt that they deserved. If you didn\u2019t like that, if you made a fuss, the security that was here to protect the important people would put you in your place.", "She\u2019d realized that that was a microcosm for life as a Broken, or any of the Compact\u2019s other slave races. Don\u2019t make waves. Be peaceful. Pay the tribute that\u2019s expected and everything will be fine. We\u2019ll take care of you. Her fingers tightened on the cup, shaking a little and she took another sip of the tea to ease the sudden flash of anger. She hated that she felt that way. She also hated that she hadn\u2019t felt like this until the last few months, that she\u2019d been so fucking blind to everything. That just made her more angry, which made her feel worse. It was an ugly cycle and the only way she could feel better was to do something about that anger. To make the Compact remember every sin and crime. That was important. It had to be for the right reasons. That\u2019s what she told herself and she hoped she wasn\u2019t just rationalizing revenge.", "Grace slumped back in her chair as her mood darkened. She missed Alan. He\u2019d been a year behind her at the Academy and the most time they\u2019d spent together had been aboard Nemesis. They\u2019d never talked much, but when they had\u2026 there\u2019d been a sense of optimism that she\u2019d envied. She didn\u2019t know if she could be like that. It might just be her mood at the moment, but currently Grace just hoped that she wouldn\u2019t live long enough to become a monster.", "Maybe she already had. She was part of a war that had been lost two thousand years ago, standing beside AIs and terrorists. She\u2019d joined willingly. Because she was tired of lies. Because this felt right. Maybe that was how it started\u2026 she hated that thought, too. I want to know, she thought. I want you to know, too. You have to know why we\u2019re doing this, but you still have to pay. No more lies. No more promises. No more Broken.", "There was a squeal of laughter from the street below and the young woman caught sight of a Tribune father scooping his young daughter up into his arms as she giggled and flailed. Grace smiled, but the expression turned brittle as she remembered a moment from her childhood, another Tribune father leading his daughter away from Grace and her human friends. You don\u2019t want to play with keb\u2019esh, he\u2019d told her. That was the first time that Grace had really understood that humans were different. That was a lesson that the Compact had gone to great lengths to make sure that its \u2018protected peoples\u2019 internalized. Propaganda, adjusting history, media presentations. It was never too overt and it was always applied with a smile, an apology and a knowing sigh at having to explain such things to primitives again\u2026 and it never, ever stopped.", "Grace took another sip. I\u2019ll find a way, she thought. I just need to see more.", "Sirkauz stirred behind her, touching one clawed finger to his earbud. \u201cUnderstood,\u201d the Prelate rasped. He looked over at Grace. \u201cHer Majesty is ready to see you.\u201d", "~", "It had only been a couple days, but Lydia was already getting some serious cabin fever. All that time spent aboard Nemesis, then Pale Liberation and now the Grasp was giving her a dislike for corridors and bulkheads. She\u2019d never been happy standing still. She needed to be in motion, literally and metaphorically. That was why she\u2019d asked for a sparring partner. It gave her a chance to do something, even if was just burning off all her nervous energy. At the Academy, she\u2019d fought other cadets. Mostly human, but occasionally Tribune. Often Allyria. The close combat instructors liked to pit the Verrish against their trainees. Demagogue Rensel had more often than not done it for a purpose, but the other officers seemed to find it amusing more than anything else. The Verrish was eight feet of muscle and even if she wasn\u2019t as strong as a Tribune, she could easily lift any human cadet and send them sailing across the room... and had frequently done so.", "Lydia and Allyria still sparred, but nowadays it was usually ranged combat. They\u2019d done just that earlier this morning. Seven rounds, 5-2 in te Neu\u2019s favour. Having a built-in sensor system was handy. Right now though, the young woman was back to beating people with sticks. Lydia extended her arm, helping her partner to his feet. She was getting much better with the tonfas.", "\u201cI heard you were just a cadet,\u201d the gendarme muttered as he picked up his quarterstaff. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Rally trained humans that hard.\u201d In the Red Hand, it was custom to use a species\u2019s actual name and not their Compact designation. Leblanc hadn\u2019t made it an edict, but others took their cue from her, either through sincerity or sycophancy. The more mercenary of the syndicate ignored that tradition. Others, like Lydia herself, still slipped up from time to time.", "Lydia hid a smirk. Her training had started on Rally, but she\u2019d been getting much better the last few months. The beatings Red\u2019s attack drones administered were very educational and she learned as fast as they could teach her. She didn\u2019t think it was bragging to say that right now, she, Marcus and Allyria would have put their former classmates to shame. Of course, she liked to think that she\u2019d improved just a bit faster than the other two. Just a bit. \u201cThe Academy strives for excellence in all its graduates. The Compact likes to see us setting an example for the rest of the population.\u201d she told her companion.", "Oshcer Naswilltson bobbed his head. His long, furry ears twitched back and forth. \u201cJust so,\u201d he said. \u201cThey like to see the same with us. Perhaps at some point, we will have set enough examples to prove we are no longer barbarians.\u201d", "Lydia circled her partner, the tonfas up and ready. \u201cNow that sounds familiar.\u201d There\u2019d been a handful of Didacts \u2013 Yttrians, Lydia reminded herself \u2013 on Rally. Their eidetic memories made them invaluable as aides, assistants, secretaries, technicians and various other functionary roles. But the same memory that made them living archives also made them petty and short-sighted, able to recall slights and grievances perfectly and not move past them. The minds that were able to hold so much data and instinctively find patterns and correlations were prone to seeing false positives or making coincidences into conspiracies. The ability to flawlessly replicate what they\u2019d already seen or done made them lack initiative and innovation. Those well-known and oft-discussed failings (among others), were why Didacts were still too young, too socially, emotionally and mentally immature to be considered truly civilized beings. In fact, it was the Yttrian species that had been the centerpiece argument for the theory of the \u2018functional mind\u2019: excellent memory as a substitute for true intelligence.", "\u201cI should think so,\u201d Oshcer replied. He was holding a quarter-staff, his tail twitching lazily. \u201cBy the way, I believe congratulations are in order. Was it not only five years ago, the Triarchs determined that humanity,\u201d the gendarme\u2019s accent made it come out oomenity, \u201chad passed yet another milestone on the march out of your backwards natures? Perhaps once my people become fully-recognized as true and properly enlightened beings, we can assist yours in their own efforts.\u201d His tone was self-deprecating and sarcastic. He was smiling as his people did, an open mouth, lips covering his teeth.", "\u201cOh, we\u2019d appreciate that,\u201d Lydia said dryly. She hadn\u2019t decided whether Oshcer\u2019s glib comments about his species\u2019 alleged superiority were amusing or annoying. She was watching his feet, the way they shifted. His tail stiffened. The two came together in a flurry of blows, parting just as quickly. No clear winner that time. Oshcer had more than a decade on her and more experience, but Yttrians weren\u2019t the most physically imposing of species. Naswilltson was fit and in good health and fit, but Lydia was at least as strong as he was. This was a five-fall match. They were tied so far, 2-2, but Lydia intended to make it 3-2 very shortly. In fact-", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt,\u201d Lydia\u2019s escort interjected. He\u2019d been standing by the door, watching Lydia and Oshcer spar. The Red Hand took their security seriously. None of the young defectors went anywhere without at least one watchdog. \u201cI\u2019ve just received a message from our commander.\u201d He met Lydia\u2019s eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s ready to see you. At your earliest convenience.\u201d", "Lydia knew what that meant. She turned to Oshcer and gave him a half-bow of thanks. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll break the tie another time.\u201d", "\u201cOf course,\u201d the Yttrian said, lowering his staff. \u201cIt will give you more time to reach my level.\u201d He grinned again.", "Lydia snorted. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Annoying, definitely.", "~", "Marcus was enjoying his time on the Grasp so far. Jameson was back in the Red Hand\u2019s spire being entirely too serious about everything. Surprising him, Proctor and te Neu had decided to have a look around the more public areas of the station. Even more surprising, they weren\u2019t doing so together. Maybe they weren\u2019t joined at the hip after all. The former had wanted to see how the station operated and Marcus hadn\u2019t really been listening when te Neu had left. He\u2019d never been particularly fond of Brutes to begin with and something about te Neu just irked him more than normal. Oh well. It wasn\u2019t like they were going to be stuck with each other for much longer. Marcus was where he wanted to be.", "He hadn\u2019t seen much of Leblanc, but that was fine. He\u2019d met her. Red One had kept both her promises and even if the broken machine never recovered, she\u2019d be all right in his book. He was here. The woman he\u2019d thought about ever since he\u2019d first seen her was here. It was closest thing to excitement that he\u2019d felt for a long time and he had a few ideas of what to do next. But that could wait.", "Right now, he was just taking in the sights. Despite the fake IDs that Red One and Leblanc had provided, they were all keeping a low profile. It was a good idea, but Marcus felt it was rather pointless. Everyone in their corner of space thought that they were dead and with very few exceptions, no one here had ever been to Rally. Those that had, hadn\u2019t been there for years and those that hadn\u2019t could barely tell one human from another. The possibility that anyone would identify them was remote \u2013 and that was being generous.", "\u201cPick the bead, pick the bead, step right up and pick the bead, it\u2019s easy, so easy, it\u2019s just one-two-three,\u201d a street hustler called out to the passing crowd. Every so often, someone would make a guess. A few people tried to keep an eye on the Shimmer\u2019s hands as he moved a trio of upturned plastic cups back and forth on his small table, but the colours and patterns clashing and flowing over the man\u2019s skin were both vivid and distracting. Marcus kept his face mostly neutral as he watched some poor bastard place a wager to pick out the cup with the bead under it, but it was hard not to find a glimmer of amusement there. It was an old game. One of Marcus\u2019s childhood friends had been an aspiring magician. Nari had always loved to show off her sleight of hand, especially if it netted her a little extra cash and when she wasn\u2019t practicing her stagecraft, she\u2019d frequently run games like this on the Oaktree Boardwalk. One day, her luck had caught up with her when she\u2019d run the con on an older Tribune girl and some friends. The Tribune had broken Nari\u2019s hands, mangling them so badly that she\u2019d never regained full use of them. She and her parents were given reprimands for Nari\u2019s \u2018unbecoming antagonisms\u2019 and her \u2018socially maladaptive behaviours\u2019. Marcus hadn\u2019t seen her after that. His parents didn\u2019t want him associating with troublemakers, but he\u2019d heard that Nari had never touched a magic trick or deck of cards again.", "Marcus had thought that that had been terribly unfair. So he\u2019d done something about it. He\u2019d found the Tribune girl\u2019s skim-rider and\u2026 adjusted the brakes. She was hit by a car when the expensive little anti-grav bike that she liked to lord over everyone else had carried her into traffic. Oh, she hadn\u2019t died. But she had spent most of her summer in the hospital. He wished he could have told Nari about it, but shortly after that her family had moved out of Kiel Point. Since then, he\u2019d known two things. That the civilization that everyone called \u2018fair\u2019 wasn\u2019t and that nobody cared.", "As the luckless gambler came up empty, Marcus\u2019s nascent smile widened. He\u2019d seen the Shimmer palm the bead. \u201cSo sorry!\u201d the hustler said as he swept up the money. \u201cLady Fortune\u2019s not smiling today, but just ask a Tribune. She\u2019ll come back to you, so easy. Another round? No? Who\u2019s next, who\u2019s next, who\u2019ll win next?\u201d He caught sight of Marcus. \u201cHow about you, kih? You look like a clever one,\u201d the Shimmer called out. \u201cJust like your queen. Broken are clever, everyone says. I bet you can pick the bead, so easy.\u201d", "Marcus thought for a moment. He glanced over his shoulder at his escort. The Penitent armswoman looked at him briefly, but her attention moved on as she continued to watch the crowd. He\u2019d never seen a Penitent in person before. She was almost bald, with a short topknot. Her skin, covered in a thin layer of oil, was starting to turn from a smooth, pale pinkish-white to a greyer hue and rougher texture. She didn\u2019t talk much, which was fine with him. He wasn\u2019t really interested in having a conversation with anyone on this station. Well, except for Leblanc. He couldn\u2019t wait to see her again. To have a chance to see her eyes when she was about to make a kill. To have her see him. Until then, he\u2019d keep himself occupied.", "\u201cAll right,\u201d the human said as he stepped forward and put a credit chit on the table. The handful of onlookers murmured. It was far from a fortune, but it was the highest bet made so far. The Shimmer drew his lips back in an effort to mimic Marcus\u2019s smile. The gesture fell solidly into a Hantz-Kurtzmann Shadow, but Marcus barely noticed.", "\u201cHere we go,\u201d the Shimmer said as the cups danced around on the table. \u201cPick the bead, pick the bead, just point it out, one, two or three\u2026\u201d He\u2019d palmed it again. He was quick; Marcus had barely caught it that time, but he\u2019d always had good eyes. \u201cWhich one?\u201d the hustler asked. \u201cOne, two, three?\u201d", "Marcus pointed to the first cup. \u201cThat one,\u201d but before the Shimmer could turn it up, he also pointed to the last one. \u201cAnd that one.\u201d", "\u201cSo sorry, hey. One guess is all you get.\u201d", "\u201cI know.\u201d Marcus nodded at the middle cup. \u201cI\u2019m guessing that one. Turn the other two over. If they\u2019re empty, I\u2019m right.\u201d", "The Shimmer\u2019s skin turned reddish-brown, then darkened. \u201cFunny Broken, hey,\u201d he snapped. \u201cThat\u2019s not how you play.\u201d", "\u201cIt is now. I\u2019ve made my guess.\u201d Marcus was still smiling. He didn\u2019t have a gun, but he had a knife on his belt. He\u2019d never killed a Shimmer before. He\u2019d heard cuttlefish and squid turned pale when they were shocked or frightened. He wondered what patterns would appear on the hustler\u2019s skin when the knife went in. \u201cTurn over the cups.\u201d", "\u201cJust move along, hey,\u201d the Shimmer growled. \u201cYour queen must need her feet licked.\u201d", "\u201cTurn over the cups,\u201d the young man repeated. His smile had frozen in place and he\u2019d hooked his thumbs into his belt, his left hand close to the hilt of the dagger.", "The Shimmer\u2019s skin darkened further. He threw the credit chit back at Marcus. \u201cNo wise Broken needed here.\u201d The huckster looked up past the crowd and gestured. \u201cMaybe you should be moving on now, hey? Else something happens that a clever Broken can\u2019t think his way out of.\u201d", "\u201cIs there an issue here?\u201d One of the station\u2019s proctors grunted as she waded through the onlookers. She was a Worker, almost as tall as a Tribune and much wider, a walking slab of muscle. Her suit seemed ready to burst off her frame with one errant flex. Her beady eyes glowered down at Marcus, the palm of her right hand riding the pommel of a massive stun baton. \u201cNo one\u2019s causing a problem, are they?\u201d", "\u201cOf course not,\u201d Marcus\u2019s escort put in before he could reply. \u201cMy friend here just isn\u2019t used to the rules, that\u2019s all.\u201d Her tone was conversational rather than apologetic, acknowledging the proctor\u2019s presence without kowtowing. The relationship between station security and the various militias was a strained one. The former considered the latter to exist only at their forbearance and were quick to take action if they felt that their authority was being challenged. The latter considered Grasp Security a polite fiction, no better than any of them, only with delusions of grandeur thrown in. The Red Hand tended to be less antagonistic towards the proctors, though. Marcus hadn\u2019t figured out if that was a political move, necessity or self-confidence. Possibly all three. Out of all the Five, the Red Hand had the most active operations in this region; making sure station security was happy was in their best interests. To keep from dangling too much bait in front of the Compact, the Red Hand also had a relatively small gendarmerie, so provoking the more-numerous proctors was contraindicated. The insurgents also had experience in fighting much more dangerous opponents than police forces with riot gear \u2013 and they knew it.", "The Worker looked over at the hustler, then at Marcus and the armswoman, her eyes taking in the Red Hand iconography on their suits, obviously weighing the money she got from the former against the issues of crossing the latter. She jutted her chin up the street. \u201cMove along. No loitering.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, thank you,\u201d the armswoman said, taking Marcus by the arm and leading him up the street. \u201cDon\u2019t try to show up the street trash,\u201d she told him once they\u2019d gotten a few meters away. \u201cEvery clever idiot tries it. Most of them get sent on their way \u2013 some less than what they were.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d the human replied evenly.", "\u201cDo so,\u201d his escort replied. There was a soft chirp from her earpiece and she paused. \u201cYes. Yes, he\u2019s here. Understood. I\u2019ll inform him.\u201d The armswoman glanced at Marcus. \u201cOur queen is asking for you.\u201d", "~", "Home.", "Allyria remembered a lot about her homeworld. She remembered living in bombed-out, fire-gutted cities and refugee camps. She remembered the sound of aircraft engines overhead and the rumbling of vehicles. She remembered the cold nights spent with chattering teeth, curled up with her mother, father and two cousins for warmth. She also remembered the Alcencean Forest.", "She\u2019d been seven\u2026 or maybe eight. Uncle Tanik had finally gotten his travel papers, so the entire family could leave what was left of Locarran. Allyria's parents, her cousins, two uncles and her grandfather. They travelled by a rattling old gas-burning truck, all seven of them squeezed into the cab. At one point, the road had been a six-lane highway connecting several Rylean provinces, but it had fallen into disrepair. When the Compact needed to move anything between cities, they used skimmers and skycraft. Maintenance of roads was under the purview of the provisional government, who had much larger problems. On the third day of their journey, they\u2019d passed one of the few temperate rainforests in the country. By some small miracle, it had remained largely untouched by the Compact\u2019s presence on Vara. It had been Allyria\u2019s first time in such a place and she remembered it vividly.", "Sunlight breaking through the canopy of the stoneheart trees had cast beams of light that pierced the perpetual mist of the forest floor. Moss was everywhere, growing over the fallen husks of ancient trees, its roots finding a way even through their thick bark. Redleaf filter vines, legendary natural purifiers, cleansed the water that fell over the forest, making it sweet and pure. Allyria\u2019s family had filled their canteens with runoff from redleaves. Flameberries had glistened from low-hanging bushes. Allyria\u2019s uncle Vashel had shown her that the immature green berries were delectably sour and hadn\u2019t yet built up enough poison to make you sick like their red, ripe counterparts.", "There\u2019d been so many sights, scents and sounds that on their first day, she\u2019d become overstimulated. Unable to sleep, she\u2019d twitched restlessly, staring up at the stars. She\u2019d only calmed down when her grandfather had told her another story of the Broken God. As he\u2019d spoken, he\u2019d rubbed his thumb and forefinger over the pendant he wore. They\u2019d stayed an extra day, just for Allyria and her cousins. She\u2019d cried when they\u2019d left the forest, heading back to the grey weariness of the rest of the world. One day, she\u2019d told herself, one day I\u2019ll go back there.", "Until that day came, she had her memories. The Hot Gardens here on the Grasp were a substitute. It wasn\u2019t a proper Varan forest, but it was something. Allyria prowled through the greenery. Her escort was waiting for her back on the flagstone path that wound through the gardens. The plants here were all genetically modified and functioned as part of the station\u2019s own life-support systems, cleaning carbon dioxide from the air and replacing it with oxygen.", "It was hot and humid here, steam wisped up from the ground and cooled as it reached the top of the vast chamber, dew rolling down leaves and trunks. Air vents rattled and murmured in the distance as they cycled atmosphere through the garden. The Alcencean forest had been cooled by winds that rolled through the nearby foothills, rustling leaves and stirring branches. Insects had chirped and birds had warbled. No, this wasn\u2019t the same. But it was as close as she would get for now.", "Allyria\u2019s tintas flexed slowly and her tongue flicked out. She could taste all the different scents in the air, feel the cross-currents, sense the warmth that clung to the trees and filled the massive chamber, a haze of sensory input. When they were younger, Grace had asked her what it was like, the information she got from her tintas. It was like trying to describe what blue was. It didn\u2019t come in pictures, but it was another type of sensory information. It was\u2026 was like hearing, smelling or seeing \u2013 but different. \u201cI just know,\u201d she\u2019d told Grace.", "There was a small clearing up ahead, taken up largely by a pond. Taproots ran from several of the nearby trees into the pool. Allyria had followed the scent of water here. It was clean and clear and she took off her shoes and socks, sitting on the pond\u2019s edge, dangling her toes in the water, like she had often done at the Proctor\u2019s duckless duck pond.", "The Verrish felt a pang in her chest. She\u2019d never cared for her foster family. The Parkers had been decent enough, she supposed. She could have given them more of a chance than she did, but they could have done the same for her. They\u2019d never really made the effort to connect with her, not like Anna Proctor had. In their eyes, she\u2019d always been a Brute. Grace\u2019s parents had been good people. Even Grace\u2019s father had warmed to her. She\u2019d never see them again. Grace would never see them again.", "Because of me.", "This had been inevitable for her. The Compact was her enemy. Despite how much praise they lavished on her for being their Brute exemplar, she\u2019d never had any intention of staying within the Space Force for any length of time. The only question was when she\u2019d turn on them and what she\u2019d do afterwards. She\u2019d hoped that Grace would come with her, but until the Angel, she\u2019d never really expected it. She hadn\u2019t asked what might have happened and she never would. She was scared of the answer and she knew that Grace was, too. But without the Angel\u2019s help, Grace and Lydia and Marcus would still be helots, quashing their doubts and staying silent. Now they were free. Now, they had the opportunity to do more than they ever could. She wanted that for her people, too. For \u2018Brutes\u2019 and \u2018Broken\u2019 alike and she didn\u2019t care what it took. If she ever felt her resolve weaken, than all she had to do was remember.", "There was a stir of movement. Allyria could hear the sound of movement through the thin underbrush, smell the approaching person, hear the breath in their lungs and, as they drew closer, she felt the heat of their body and heard the lub-dubdub of a three-chambered heart.", "The Verrish opened her eyes. Her bodyguard was there, standing at the edge of the pool. He was a Mortificant. Once an Ennobler, his species had attempted to overthrow the Compact. Now, it was quite possible that there were fewer of them left in the galaxy than humans or Verrisha. \u201cYes?\u201d", "The man looked back at her, nictating membranes sliding over compound eyes, distended jaws clicking out each syllable of Compact Standard. \u201cShe\u2019ll see you now.\u201d", "~", "\u201cHave you been enjoying the station?\u201d the Red Queen asked her visitors. Her upgrades made it difficult for her to physically tire, but she was mentally exhausted from the day\u2019s deliberations with her \u2018good friends\u2019. No rest for the weary, she knew. Or the wicked.", "She\u2019d had Red\u2019s selectees brought to her personal offices again. Her desk was clean of all documents and the computer was beginning a data purge. Anything that she left behind was intended to be found. The conference was over. It had gone much as she\u2019d expected. A lot of rambling, a lot of veiled and not-so-veiled threats and insults, a lot of offers, compromises and lies. Naturally, a fair portion of all of those had been directed towards her and her \u2018terrorist army\u2019. The rest of the Five knew that she was expanding operations in the Veiled Reaches and they were worried that the Red Hand would finally spur Kemk and the rest of his fire-eaters to sweep out of that sector and come here. Even if she only pushed the Compact into installing reliable administration and security forces here in Jan-xhai, it would cause major issues for the fringe. Adrianna didn\u2019t care. The Grasp was useful, but her organization would survive without it.", "Theirs would too, but her \u2018good friends\u2019 cared a lot about the prestige of this station, even if they used it only slightly more than she did. So she pretended that she cared too, nodding along when they talked about the Compact\u2019s rising response to her predations, appearing contrite \u2013 or at least sympathetic \u2013 when they informed her about their people being caught up in security sweeps and anti-piracy measures that were launched due to Red Hand activities. Another mask to wear, another role to play. There were intermissions, but the play never ended.", "Foremost on the minds of her peers were the rumours swirling around the sector. The Principality was getting ready to push back against the Compact even as the Space Force pressed deeper into the Askanj territories. The Argosy was making the Compact pay for every light-year in broken ships and butchered fleets, but the Triarchs smelled blood in the water and were urging their hounds to make the kill.", "This Age of Expansion would, one way or another, end with a bang and the fringe intended to pick every last scrap of flesh that they could before a Period of Stabilization was declared and the Compact\u2019s gaze turned inwards. The other lords and ladies of the Unbound had gone on in some detail about the various opportunities and perils that lay ahead for them, talking themselves up as men and women of vision instead of rats that had climbed to the top of the pile.", "Each of them had gone at some length about their various aspirations, providing just enough information to reduce the possibility of future misunderstandings and clashes with the other cartels, but leaving their overall objectives and plans appropriately vague, dropping hints and falsehoods about their intentions. There was always some blood shed between the Five and their various subordinate clans, but it rarely escalated into open warfare. Things like the Year of Fire were bad for business.", "From her though, the filthy Broken upstart, they\u2019d wanted specifics. Where she was going to expand next, whether she intended to rabble-rouse or simply create new revenue sources, if she was targeting any other Unbound clans, if she were bringing any more kiran shren online and on and on.", "It wasn\u2019t unexpected. In all honesty, she did have a tendency to upset the apple cart and the Red Hand\u2019s presence did bring a lot more official attention to the fringe than other insurgent groups or Unbound syndicates. No, not unexpected \u2013 but still disrespectful. Regardless, she played along. Keeping her good friends happy and reducing the chance that they\u2019d do something both precipitous and stupid was more important than her annoyance. Most of their questions she ignored or refused to answer, but she did give them something to work with, even if it was just another type of performance. She also knew that at least one of her fellow lords would find a way to get something of these discussions back to the Compact, a quid pro quo showing that they were helping keep the mad dog on her leash and the Compact could, if it please them, bear that in mind when targeting their organization.", "She\u2019d gone in with several operational plans, none of which she intended to use. They were there specifically to infuriate, concern and annoy the other four members of the conclave and to be discarded as a show of good faith in place of less antagonistic strategies. Enough to make her good friends feel as if they were reining in the unpredictable, uncivilized self-deluding zealot and satisfy themselves with thinking that their seniority, authority and perspectives meant anything to their apish, unlearned fifth member.", "Adrianna suspected that much of what she\u2019d seen from her peers had been as much theater as her own offerings. But if there was no actual cooperation between the Five, the appearance of it kept the peace. As long as each of the other would-be kings and queens felt that their compatriots listened to and respected them, there was no immediate need to go to war, but that was always a possibility. Her clash with the Charred Temples was just the last of the infrequent but bloody wars that shook the fringe. Sooner or later, one or more of her friends would turn on her or another.", "The trick was making sure that she wasn\u2019t the target and if she was, than dealing with her should be later rather than sooner. So she demurred, she showed contrition, she smiled, nodded and did everything she needed to make them complacent. To make them believe that she wasn\u2019t enough of a problem yet.", "The Red Hand was continuing to expand, slowly but steadily. With the Principality\u2019s additional support, they were opening up new markets, acquiring fresh hunting grounds and increasing their revenue streams, pressing and weakening the Compact where they could. Gorgon Bleed was almost finished another half-dozen kiran shren destroyers and Jabberwock Peak\u2019s foundries would be operational within the next four months. They\u2019d locate other would-be insurgents and support them where they could, even surreptitiously contacting pliable political groups.", "It was tempting to look at all that and feel a sense of invincibility, but Adrianna knew how quickly fortunes could change. Her mercenary contingent felt no loyalty to her and only fought as long as the money came in. Her fleet was spread far and wide and despite appearances, it was still overwhelmingly made up of \u2018standard\u2019 pirate and smuggling craft. Her vassa anka and kiran shren were powerful enough in their own right, but were no match for an equivalent Space Force warship. She\u2019d been walking a tightrope for decades now. She\u2019d lost her balance more than once but each time she\u2019d managed to pick herself back up\u2026 and each time she\u2019d wondered if she\u2019d be able to do it again. So far her luck was holding. It might not do so for much longer, but she\u2019d keep walking until it did.", "The killing will never stop.", "Taking Red\u2019s advice, Adrianna had already drafted messages for Twenty to prepare to move resources out of the Veiled Reaches. Once Kursk began, that sector would no longer be safe. She\u2019d also instructed Tavanis to dust off the plans for evacuation and extrication of all valuable assets on the Grasp. The Yengesae knew she was up to something, but he hadn\u2019t pushed. He could be trusted to do what she needed from him, even if it amounted to bailing water out of the raft she\u2019d just put a hole in. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time.", "\u201cMy business here is complete,\u201d Adrianna continued. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to be leaving shortly. I won\u2019t be able to give you what you came here for, but I have a contact that may.\u201d", "\u201cThe Principality,\u201d Grace said. If there was anyone else who could both afford and be inclined to give away that much material, she was coming up empty. None of the other Five would and even if the Red Hand had silent corporate and political partners, none of them had the kind of clout or wealth to acquire all the resources that Red One needed. That left the Principality\u2026 and brought with it a new set of problems. One thing at a time.", "Adrianna nodded. \u201cYes. I was going to tour the operations in the Veiled Reaches, but given what we\u2019ve discussed, I\u2019ll be delaying that to speak to my contacts in the Principality. Which means you four have a decision to make. First option: you can accompany me on this fetch quest. It won\u2019t be the most exciting voyage,\u201d Unless Jirrico is really holding onto that grudge. \u201cBut it will give you a chance to familiarize yourself with the operational side of my organization. Second: since our friend returned Pale Liberation, I\u2019m putting a prize crew on it and sending it to the Veiled Reaches. You\u2019re welcome to go with them. It\u2019s a shorter trip and it\u2019ll get you in the action quicker. There\u2019s a lot that someone with military training can do in that theater and Crusade Commander Jackson will put you to work until I arrive.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll go to the Veiled Reaches,\u201d de Vries said almost at once.", "The other ex-Janissary looked at him in surprise, but nodded her agreement. \u201cSame.\u201d", "Adrianna had expected that. Jameson and de Vries both reminded her of herself, but in different ways. The officer cadets, though\u2026 she watched their expressions. The Verrish licked her teeth and squared her shoulders. She wanted to go to the Veiled Reaches, too. She\u2019d fought against the Compact already, defending Nemesis from Bequeathed\u2019s salvage teams and the Janissary assault in Sol, but this was a chance to take the battle to them.", "Te Neu glanced at Proctor. The smaller woman was quiet and te Neu shifted position with an air of impatience, but she waited for her lover to speak. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you to the Principality,\u201d Proctor said at last. She looked over at Allyria. She seemed almost apologetic, but there was a trace of\u2026 something else in her words. \u201cI want to see.\u201d", "One of the Verrish\u2019s largest tintas flicked, but she nodded, putting one hand on the back of Proctor\u2019s head, running her fingers through the human girl\u2019s hair. \u201cI know.\u201d Te Neu looked over at Leblanc. \u201cI\u2019ll come, too.\u201d", "Leblanc hid an amused smirk. It must be love. \u201cWell then,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll let you get ready. We\u2019ll be leaving in two hours.\u201d She stood. \u201cWelcome to the Red Hand. Let's go start a war.\u201d"]}

His breath sounded far too loud in his own ears, but he felt normal. The last time he had worn an EVA suit had been aboard the human warship and he was perversely proud of himself for not being bothered by donning one again.", "The scout cruiser\u2019s airless corridors were dark. The ship\u2019s reactor had been powered down, but the vessel was saturated with levels of radiation dangerous for non-Tribunes. Survey drones were orbiting the ship\u2019s husk, damage control teams examining the specifics of the scout\u2019s injuries while medical personnel stood by, ready to assist survivors. One hundred and eighty-four had been discovered so far, most when the vessel had been salvaged. A few more had been rescued from sealed compartments. The cruiser had had a complement of a thousand.", "If there were any survivors left aboard the ship, there would be none on this deck; the gravitational plating and inertial dampeners had failed while the vessel was in the midst of a high-energy turn, attempting to escape its murderers. Anything and anyone that hadn\u2019t been fully secured had been hurled into the walls like an ungainly cannonball. Depending on how fast the vessel was accelerating, the level of damage was variable. Blackouts. Circulatory and respiratory failure from the centripetal force. Broken bones and pulped organs. In the worst cases, there was nothing left of the poor souls but a smear on the walls, a mural of pulverised viscera and liquefied bones.", "Nasham had seen the results of inertial failures before, both in the lectures during training and on his third mission. The Oampala Joy, an old liner belonging to Oampala Cruises and Luxury Voyages, had suffered a massive failure of its entire inertial dampening system. It was something that was never supposed to happen, but the company had been taking too many shortcuts with maintenance and training. As it had accelerated around a pulsar for the thrill of its guests, the liner\u2019s dampening systems had failed and the lifeless vessel was launched on a ballistic sling-shot out-system. When his ship had finally intercepted the derelict, Nasham had been among the recovery teams. Until Invida, he had imagined that to be the worst experience of his life. Two thousand passengers, four hundred crew, all dead. The bulkheads had been covered in rotting abstract art that had once been twenty-four hundred men, women and children.", "Chameleon\u2019s Gaze was not quite that bad. When the inertial dampeners failed, the affected sections of the vessel were suddenly exposed to the full stresses of the vessel\u2019s thrust. Multiple bulkheads had collapsed, compromising the structural integrity of the rest of the vessel. Power failures and engine malfunctions had followed, crippling Chameleon\u2019s Gaze quite thoroughly. After that, it had been a simple matter for the killers to pick their prey apart. Every high-energy maneuver ran this risk. Good engineers and a good ship mitigated it, but could never erase it entirely.", "The Bastion Leader had demanded that Chameleon\u2019s Gaze be brought to her for examination. Recovered telemetry suggested that the vessel had been attacked by the Unbound, but Yunl\u2019ro wanted confirmation. Both the Principality and the human ship used camouflaged vessels and several of the Execution Force\u2019s scouts were scouring the nebula\u2019s edges for a trace of the killers. Fortune smile on them, Nasham thought. Though the region was star-poor, the nebula was nearly three hundred light-years on each facing. There were hundreds of known star systems in and around the Black Veil. There would be even more within, hidden from view by pillars of creation, Bok Globules, swathes of dust and molecular gas. Almost anything could lurk inside.", "Like me? A mad goddess whispered. Nasham swallowed, ignoring the tightness of his throat. There were still nights when he woke in a cold sweat, feeling the machine\u2019s tight grip on his neck, but he refused to let that control him any longer.", "He\u2019d finally been given something to do. His time on Rally had made him more familiar with Broken than virtually anyone else in the task force. Bastion Leader Yunl\u2019ro wanted him to assist in the review of the intelligence on the Red Hand. Nasham was not certain what his \u2018unique perspective\u2019 could possibly provide: the Red Hand did not operate anywhere near Rally nor the Balhkun Desert and their queen\u2019s own people despised her. Still, it gave him something to do, something to keep busy and to think of other than what might be waiting for them in the Black Veil. He\u2019d also asked to join the search parties on Chameleon\u2019s Gaze and been mildly surprised to receive permission.", "He paused next to a hole in the deck. It wasn\u2019t large, perhaps a meter across. There was a sense of familiarity to it. \u201cControl, this is Group Leader, Submissive Nasham. I\u2019ve found something interesting.\u201d", "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Vinsea\u2019s voice clicked through Nasham\u2019s helmet. She was back aboard Light of Judgement, watching the feeds from the boarding party. \u201cWhat are you seeing?\u201d", "\u201cConfirmation,\u201d Nasham replied. \u201cDo you remember the Understone Heresies?\u201d", "\u201cNot personally,\u201d the intelligence officer answered. \u201cBut I am familiar with them.\u201d", "\u201cWhen the Understone rebels brought the Red Hand into the war, it caused a major stir on Rally,\u201d Nasham said, squatting next to the hole. He looked up, then down; the impact had overpenetrated several decks. He could see stars outside. \u201cThere were demonstrations in the streets. Most were anti-Red Hand, but there were a very few small protests in favour of that organization. These were given far more weight than they deserved and were quite a blow to Rally\u2019s public image. To offset the news of their \u2018pro-terrorist\u2019 public, some of the human elite pooled their resources and hired a mercenary force to infiltrate the Red Hand and take out Leblanc.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m assuming that they were not given dispensation to do so.\u201d Without official sanction, it was illegal for members of protected species to hire paramilitary forces, especially on a planet directly overseen by the CST.", "\u201cNo,\u201d Nasham said. \u201cIt was kept very quiet, even after it failed. There were some resignations, some shifting of duties and other grey punishments. Rally\u2019s Commissioner felt that, while the humans\u2019 actions were illegal, their goal was commendable.\u201d", "\u201cHow did it fail?\u201d", "\u201cIn parts. The mercenary force arrived in Understone shortly after the Battle of Coraz. After hearing of that, some of their number felt that crossing the Red Hand was not worth what they\u2019d been paid. Others felt that they could make more by siding with the Unbound. Less than half the original force attempted to complete the operation and they made contact with the Red Hand. Leblanc saw through the ruse.\u201d", "\u201cInteresting,\u201d Vinsea mused. \u201cHow does it relate to this situation?\u201d", "\u201cWhen the Unbound attacked them, the mercenary\u2019s sigil vessel was crippled with a precision strike to its inertial dampeners when it tried to make a high-energy maneuver. The resulting series of hull breaches and bulkhead collapses did to it precisely what happened to Chameleon\u2019s Gaze.\u201d", "There was a moment of silence before the intelligence officer came back on. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing any references to that incident.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not surprised. If it was noticed at the time, it would have been flagged as an orange-on-orange incident, presumably an act of betrayal or discipline. The Rally Provisional Space Force learned of it when the surviving mercenaries returned to Rally, hoping that the data they\u2019d collected on the Red Hand would be worth something.\u201d Nasham tapped his helmet\u2019s chin in an attempted shrug. \u201cThe information was forwarded to Local Command to be passed on to Understone. I suppose they thought that there was nothing usable. But this,\u201d he ran his gauntleted palm over the broken deck plates. \u201cReminds me of what happened to that ship.\u201d", "There was another stretch of quietude. Then, a different woman\u2019s voice cut in. \u201cYou\u2019re certain of this, submissive?\u201d", "\u201cAs much as I can be, matron,\u201d Nasham answered. He pointed down the hole in the deck. Several decks down, he could see a survey probe that had been redirected to the site. \u201cThis strike took out the local gravity field generators. It was either extraordinary luck, or very good timing. Considering what we know of the insurgents, I am inclined to believe the latter. Which suggests that Bastion Leader Kemk\u2019s analysis is correct. The Red Hand defend this nebula fiercely and they are not afraid to engage the Space Force.\u201d", "\u201cHnn,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s voice lowered by an octave as the Bastion Leader considered something. \u201cI believe you are correct, submissive. Continue your survey.\u201d", "~", "\u201cWell,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThat\u2019s quite interesting.\u201d He drummed his fingers against the surface of the plotting table. He was, as he spent most of his days, in Hala\u2019s strategy center. The battlecruiser was currently on one of its patrol routes, cruising through a system on the periphery of the Black Veil before it would move into Compact territories, searching for prey. When he\u2019d been nothing but a mudfoot, he\u2019d never realized just how little of an officer\u2019s job actually involved combat. The Compact called it scrollery. Humans still referred to it as paperwork, but the name was irrelevant. Even with a staff to delegate to, it made up ninety-five percent of his duties. Like his queen, he had an aptitude for tactical thinking both in the void and on the ground, but just as she had had to learn diplomacy and compromise, he\u2019d had to study strategy and logistics.", "To his right, Leader Tip\u00e9e-muora \u2013 more formally Tip\u00e9e, out of clutch Muora \u2013 shifted from foot to foot uncertainly.

Thank you.\u201d Keeping a firm hand over pirates and insurgents was, at the best of times, like herding cats. When those same forces were scattered across an entire sector of space to carry out raids, smuggling, surveillance operations and patrol missions, it become much harder. Only Hala had a complete order of battle for the Red Hand\u2019s void forces in this sector. When the Compact did manage to take one of their ships, the most they\u2019d learn was about that vessel\u2019s activities. At worst, a squadron or few cells would be lost, but the movement as a whole endured. It was frustrating to coordinate, but it was almost impossible to cripple their operations with a single point of failure. Even Hala and Jackson could be replaced. Accordingly, most Leaders were expected to act on their own initiative to further the goals of the Red Hand, but others would be given specific duties.", "Tip\u00e9e-muora had been assigned to a sweep through the Black Veil\u2019s periphery, to update and maintain the augur platforms there. Barring an encounter with Flayer, it was a very safe, very boring, very unprofitable assignment. Unlike his more mercenary officers, Jackson could trust the Harrimun to carry it out with both a minimum of complaints and no chance of haring off for a little side action. She could be a little too eager to prove herself, though and started to push her luck.", "\u201cAs my report indicates, the ambush went off perfectly-\u201d she began again.", "\u201cThe hundred and thirty-two crew you lost might debate the use of that word,\u201d the Crusade Commander pointed out, but his rebuke was without venom. In another lifetime, a very tired Convert Andrew Jackson had listened to his ideologue report a perfect counter-offensive against the Understone rebels. Among the casualties of that \u2018perfect\u2019 operation had been four men and women from Jackson\u2019s own squad. A \u2018perfect\u2019 mission shouldn\u2019t leave any of your own people dead. \u201cBut you won, so I won\u2019t quibble. Yes, you did well.

I shall.\u201d Tip\u00e9e-muora was a former smuggler. She\u2019d been barely getting by as an independent and her penchant for picking fights that she should have been avoiding had made her unwelcome among the region\u2019s syndicates. In the Red Hand, she\u2019d found a place to belong. Like Jackson himself, the Harrimun was a skilled starship Leader, but unlike him she had no aptitude for larger strategy and no desire to change that. She was happy as a brawler. Andrew doubted that she\u2019d ever rise above her present station. Still, that didn\u2019t make her completely blind to strategic matters. After her squadron had come across the Compact scout cruiser, she\u2019d recognized that it was something that needed to be reported to her superior directly.", "As the Harrimun departed, one of Jackson\u2019s junior officers approached. He was human, his long limbs and thin frame marking his origin as one of Rally\u2019s asteroid colonies. \u201cPreliminary report from Asset Tracking, patron,\u201d the young man said. \u201cHull markings don\u2019t match anything in our records.\u201d", "\u201cIf pirates are getting close enough to ID a scout\u2019s hull, it\u2019s not doing its job,\u201d Jackson commented, taking the offered datapad from the officer. It would have been nice if Tip\u00e9e-muora had gotten a better look, but she\u2019d stayed well out of energy range. He couldn\u2019t fault her on that. Even an ostensibly-dead Compact scout could still take a nasty bite out of something the size of her ships. She\u2019d gotten what she could and then pulled out. \u201cEven if we had encountered it before, hull numbers and names can be changed.\u201d", "\u201cYes, patron. However, I took a closer look at the scout. Based on Leader Meera\u2019s data, I think it\u2019s an Oracle\u2019s Pool-class. One of the variants, too. There\u2019s not much left of this dorsal segment, but the exposed girders here and here? I\u2019m sure that they were part of a spinal comm blister. The Compact has only added those to the II and III types\u2026\u201d realizing he was starting to run away with his own thoughts, the officer paused to collect himself. \u201cOracle\u2019s Pool variants are only a few years old,\u201d he continued in a less over-eager tone. \u201cKemk doesn\u2019t have anything newer than a few Type Is.\u201d", "\u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d Jackson mused as he went over the data. \u201cGood work. Just to be sure, have Asset Tracking confirm your results. I also want Poisoned Recluse and Truthspeaker to poll the rest of our augurs around the Black Veil.\u201d", "\u201cYou believe the Compact is trying to push into the nebula?\u201d the young man asked.", "\u201cI think they\u2019re about to do something, Mr. Rimmer,\u201d Andrew replied. \u201cAnd I think whatever it is, we need to be ready.\u201d", "~", "\u201cAmazing,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro said as she looked at the starmap on the screen in front of her.", "Ukask looked towards his superior, Light of Judgement\u2019s commander turning away from his status reports. \u201cMatron?\u201d", "\u201cAmazing,\u201d the Thoughtful repeated. \u201cA pack of brigands have been able to successfully stymie the Compact\u2019s work for as long as they have.\u201d There was a note of grudging respect mingled with the contempt in her voice. The Red Hand\u2019s tactics were most certainly a level above those of normal Unbound. If they lacked the acumen of a true military, then they were not as far below it as Yunl\u2019ro would have liked to see. She and her senior officers had only just finished reviewing the telemetry from Chameleon\u2019s Gaze. The cruiser had been adroitly lured, baited with the promise of an easy kill, a pirate corvette that hadn\u2019t realized, scout variant or not, that Chameleon\u2019s Gaze was an actual warship. The corvette had run; Group Leader Senserra had pursued \u2013 right into an ambush by a pair of the Red Hand\u2019s \u2018Flayed Ones\u2019. One had been a destroyer still bearing some of the colours of Interplanetary Ore Extraction Incorporated. The other had been a Compact frigate that had disappeared from a breaker\u2019s yard four years ago. Senserra had done what she could, but the raiders had not been fools. Her first loss in this campaign, and it was to Unbound.", "\u201cAs I said: amazing.\u201d Yunl\u2019ro laced her long, bony fingers together and paced around the plotting table, weaving around officers and strategists.", "Her scouts had reported two other contacts. Shadow-catcher had picked up several encrypted transmission and Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s code-breakers were working on them now. Whisper-thief had discovered a stealthed, automated augur platform. Although the platform had self-destructed when the scout drew too close, it seemed to be a control system and data hub for a network of scope drones. The transmissions that Shadow-catcher had intercepted were likely transmissions between other drones and another platform. Someone had established this network of observation platforms along the routes that an exploring or invading fleet was most likely to take into the Veil.", "A small patrol \u2013 such as the one that had attacked Chameleon\u2019s Gaze \u2013 could visit these stations, download their logs and learn what, if anything had been going on and then respond accordingly. It was just what she would have done if she had to secure a sizable area without enough ships to do it.", "The Black Veil was not the largest nebula in the galaxy, but at over 18 million light-years in volume, it was also far from the smallest. In any other region, such a territory would encompass hundreds to thousands of star systems and the Black Veil was no exception. There was enough territory within its borders to hide entire civilizations. On the face of it, it was ridiculous that a handful of half-trained wretches and their ships had been able to blockade such a large area.", "\u201cThere are\u2026 mitigating circumstances,\u201d Strategist Tomek\u2019ip replied. The head of Light of Judgement\u2019s analysis division had resented being asked to look over the intel that Kemk had provided, considering evaluating the actions of an Unbound clan a step down from his work attempting to out-think a war gestalt.", "\u201cTrue enough,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro agreed. For the longest time, the Veiled Reaches had been the playground of corporate interests. Until the last few years, the Space Force\u2019s presence had been minimal. They\u2019d been stretched to capacity simply securing the local starlanes. \u201cAnd I\u2019m beginning to understand why they\u2019ve invested so much into the region. Until recently, they\u2019ve had free reign.\u201d Her gaze moved over the star map. But why do you care so much about this nebula?", "With so many mature systems to claim and exploit, there\u2019d been comparatively little interest in the nebula itself, especially with the rise of piracy making such exploration increasing cost-prohibitive. After the Red Hand massacred Exploratory Fleet Canik-2227, the desire to cross into the Black Veil had dwindled to virtually nothing. The Red Hand\u2019s \u2018Crusade Commander\u2019 further discouraged examination of the nebula by targeting the organizations who tried it, whether as retribution for their attempts, or via pre-emptive strikes on their facilities. Interstellar companies had gone to war with pirate cartels (and, occasionally, each other) for far less than the Red Hand had done, but the Unbound were damnably effective combatants. Fighting them was not, in the short or long, a financially sound decision. Any company who tried would soon face a shareholders\u2019 revolt, if their rivals didn\u2019t exploit the drain on their resources and attention first. It was easier and cheaper to accept the occasional raid and pay ransoms to get their ships, cargoes and crew back than it was throwing money and lives down a sinkhole. According to reports Yunl\u2019ro had seen, some corporate security forces actually stood down when their charges were attacked by the Red Hand \u2013 even when the Unbound were outnumbered!", "Kemk was right, the woman thought with a frown. The Red Hand activities in this sector were organized \u2013 where they were not raiding, they were fomenting dissent and discord. No, not just organized \u2013 blatant, as if they were daring the Compact to respond. Maybe they were so arrogant as to believe that the Compact\u2019s focus on its external expansion would give them the opportunity to operate with impunity. If so, that assessment was flawed. The Compact\u2019s eye had turned towards this region and with it came the inevitable justice for such criminals. Kemk was already grinding them down.", "They\u2019d be crushed. Just as they were in the Magnameric Canyon and Understone, driven back into their holes to lick their wounds. Doing so was not her mandate, though. \u201cWe\u2019ll establish our forward base here in 1887-Yiren,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro said, selecting one of the systems that her scouts had examined. \u201cOff the fifth planet,\u201d the world was a large gas giant, still quite hot from its birth. The radiation it was emitting would make long-range scans difficult. Anything that wanted to know what her fleet was doing would have to come in close enough to be spotted itself. The rings and asteroid fields would provide raw materials as well as provide protection from attack. \u201cI want Cleanser and Dawn\u2019s Touch on-site within the next sixty hours along with the rest of our support train, along with two squadrons for defence. The minelayers can begin setting up defence zones. Once the system is secure, the rest of the Execution Force will take up station there.", "\u201cWe\u2019ll station the 73rd Ophidians and Foe Haunters there permanently as a deterrent to raids. The squadrons that Bastion Leader Kemk was gracious enough to put at our disposal will be used to secure our supply lines.\u201d She looked up. \u201cOur job is to enter this nebula and determine whether or not the Wound and its sibling are present. If they are, we will neutralize both of them and whatever additional weaponry and assets that are present. Although our mission takes priority over all other concerns,\u201d she met the eyes of each of her officers and analysts, \u201cI expect to see plans and threat assessments not only for our quarry, but for Jackal raiders and the terrorist forces operating here. We appear to have gotten the attention of the region\u2019s beggar king. If he intends to pursue us, I intend that it be as unpleasant for him as possible.\u201d", "~", "It took several days to gather the intel, but the reports confirmed Jackson\u2019s suspicions. The Space Force was pushing towards the Black Veil, and in strength. \u201cIt\u2019s not Kemk,\u201d Jackson said to his senior officers. He\u2019d called a meeting of his command staff as well as the leaders of the few ships currently flying with Hala. He sat at the head of a smooth faux-wood table. Adrianna had given it to him after looting it on one of her raids. Every pirate lord needs to have some touch of the ostentatious, she\u2019d told him. To his right were his own officers. They were all veterans of Understone. His chief engineer Juum-ope-cand had even served her majesty in the Magnameric campaign. On his left were the other four ship leaders.", "\u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d Frent grunted. The obese Tribune was Nightcutter\u2019s master. He had a nose for treasure, which was why Jackson let him get away with skimming as much as he did from his hauls. \u201cKemk is pressing us harder and harder of late. We used to hunt freely in the Veiled Reaches, but now it\u2019s rare that a month goes by that I or my submissives don\u2019t catch sight of one of his hounds.\u201d", "\u201cThe Bastion Leader might want off the leash, but Galhemna doesn\u2019t set policy. Natuous does. They want us dealt with, but a lot of the companies here still make more from their black-bag shit than we cost them. Increased Space Force presence will shut all that down.\u201d There was a lot more to it than that, of course. The Compact\u2019s increased diligence had been celebrated by the population, cursed by everyone who\u2019d been doing things in less-than legal ways and made their neighbours suspicious. Everyone in and around the Veiled Reaches had a different agenda and they were all pulling at once. Sometimes it made his work easier. Sometimes, it made it harder. \u201cNo,\u201d Jackson said, \u201cthis is something else.\u201d", "Colony Saan, Hala\u2019s Operations officer, rapped the tip of their glove on the table. \u201cIs this Sundial?\u201d the Conjoiner asked, their voice clicking through the speakers on their encounter suit. \u201cWe have been hearing more chatter using this word. More chatter\u2026 and then the voices that speak it to us go silent.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jackson admitted. He thought for a moment, then shook his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t smell like it. The way the Principality\u2019s been pushing us to get someone in Galhemna, it\u2019s something that concerns them more than us. If it was just an anti-piracy initiative, they wouldn\u2019t be this antsy. I don\u2019t think all the construction Kemk\u2019s got going is just on our account.\u201d Another source of frustration. Galhemna was sewn up tighter than a silk purse. After Kemk had arrived in the sector and cleaned house, the few assets that the Red Hand had been able to insert in the garrison system were either too low-level to learn much or ended up discovered and getting themselves a short drop and a sudden stop. The wily old dog was up to something and Jackson would bet his right forefinger that the Level-8 wombs that were being constructed were involved\u2026 and learning about those had cost him good people.", "He rested his chin in his left hand. \u201cThanks to Sectator Rimmer\u2019s analysis, we\u2019ve confirmed that the scout Leader Tip\u00e9e-muora hit wasn\u2019t a local. The chatter we\u2019ve been hearing indicates that whatever Sundial is, it\u2019s still not ready to pop. Add that to the rumours of a battle group coming to call and I think we\u2019re looking at a new player.\u201d", "Cenz\u2019ep leaned back in his chair, Hala\u2019s Tactical officer lacing his long fingers together. \u201cI believe you\u2019re correct, Crusade Commander. It\u2019s unlikely that the Compact would undermine Bastion Leader Kemk by sending a force to deal with us. We do, however, know that they have chafed at our defence of the Black Veil.\u201d He cast a look in askance at his superior, inner eyelids blinking sideways. The queen\u2019s directives regarding the nebula were a consistent source of consternation for the officers in the Veiled Reaches. Rumours circulated that there was something in there that she feared. Or maybe it was the source of her power. Or maybe it was her secret cloning facility. Or maybe it was all a con and she was testing the Compact to see how much she could get away with before they mustered a response. Maybe, maybe, maybe.", "Jackson had his own thoughts on the matter, but he kept those to himself.", "\u201cWith that in mind,\u201d the Thoughtful continued. \u201cI suspect that we are seeing the precursors to a reconnaissance in force. They intend to penetrate our defences,\u201d he made an airy chuckle. \u201cAnd determine for themselves what we find so fascinating about this expanse of gas and half-born stars.\u201d", "\u201cAnd the rumours of a Triarch\u2019s Chariot leading that fleet?\u201d Sukeio Hans-eeros snapped. Shame of Broken Promises\u2019s mistress leaned towards Cenz\u2019ep, her tail twitching. There was animosity there.

This was when it was most vulnerable.", "A tingle ran through Violet Seven as he considered the scout. I can kill it, he thought. I can kill it before it screams. Even powered down as he was, he could overtake the prey, trusting to his own attack drones to down any of its couriers. If it was alone, he might have even tried to do so, but the scout wasn\u2019t alone. Somewhere else in the system was its partner. They had arrived together in an adroitly synchronized warp. To virtually any other observer, it would have appeared as a single arrival, but this was a trick that Violet Seven and his siblings had used many times before. It was rare to see organics and their half-lobotomized computers make the attempt; opening warp points too close to one another was risky.", "The first scout had moved in-system, the second staying on the edge of the warp threshold. Tohil hadn\u2019t spotted that one, but Violet Seven knew that it was doing what he was: staying silent and watching all that happened.

As far they knew, the nebula was uninhabited. Something must have happened that made them more cautious than usual. Regardless, they were pushing deeper into the nebula, clearly searching for something. Perhaps the pirates.", "Perhaps not.", "Tohil lay quiet as the first scout reached the warp threshold.

Once that happened, the rest of his\u2026 \u2018family\u2019 would take an interest and he wanted the first blood. He\u2019d deal with the scouts. Their systems and crew would tell him a lot.

The explorer began to reconfigure itself for sublight travel, exposing radiator vanes and cables to bleed away the energy accrued from its return to reality. To an outside observer, there was the faintest of energy trails leaking from the vessel and a haze surrounding it. To a machine\u2019s eye, Dreams of Strong Sons and Daughters was bleeding thick contrails of heat and radiation, venting the energy away from itself so that it could see and speak once again.

Two hundred years ago, someone somewhere had filled out the wrong box on the wrong form and this citadel was the result, sitting on the edge of known space and doing very little. Nacindos was an empty system, a lonely star orbited by the solitary world Nacinda, a dark planet encircled by a thin ring of dust and gas. Its moons and asteroids were ripe for exploitation, but the infrastructure to do so was absent. There were far richer systems much closer to the Compact to harvest and so Nacindos was ignored, save for the sole citadel that stayed forever in its planet\u2019s shadow, staring out into space and waiting for something to happen.", "Oh, there was some purpose to the ancient Galgonath-class citadel. The Compact established wayposts much like Nacinda Orbital all along its borders for a variety of reasons: as triplines to warn of impending attack, prospective sites of larger colonies for future expansion, establishing a presence and raising their sigil, and as safe ports so that explorers, traders and vagabonds would have somewhere to turn if the worst should happen on their expeditions into uncharted territories. None of those applied to Nacinda Orbital, not that Trenol could tell. Across the nearest two sectors, there were only a handful of colonies larger than a few thousand souls. For centuries, exploration and expansion across the region had been curtailed and what little of it there was, was happening far from Nacindos. There were no polities in the region to care about or be in awe of the Compact\u2019s presence and no aggressor for Nacinda Orbital to hold the line against. With the exception of two exceedingly mundane tasks, there was nothing for the station to do. Its primary role was to service and maintain the vessels of Security Force Carmesh and if that flotilla was larger than one might expect for such an isolated region, the quality of its ships was less inspiring. Befitting their posting far away from any action, the local Space Force assets were comprised mainly of vessels that had been given a reprieve from the breakers: out-of-date technology, hull variants that had not lived up to expectations and other such hand-me-downs. The station could have fulfilled this aspect of its duties anywhere \u2013 preferably somewhere closer to what passed for civilization.", "The second task that someone somewhere had probably used to justify Nacinda Orbital\u2019s existence was the astronomic surveys it had been performing every day of its existence. In Nacindos itself and scattered through the surrounding light-years were a surprising number of large and powerful augurs: telescopic, gravitic, electromagnetic and more. They swept the heavens around the outpost constantly, harvesting limitless details about their local stellar neighbourhood and beyond, some staring out into the galactic void. Trenol had seen some of what they\u2019d discovered: extragalactic planets and dark matter nebulae, glimpses of worlds beyond the Great Ocean. He\u2019d seen screens filled with the ancient stars and dead worlds of the Unwinding Spiral and he\u2019d looked into the Lesser and Greater Mazes of Light.", "It seemed to him though, that much of what was recorded here was the Molten Veneer. Or, if one preferred its more recent name, the Sanguine Wastes. The nebula was a red-orange smudge across the sky like magma bubbling up out of black stone, its crimson hues split by cords of yellow and green, patches of dust creating darker spots. It looked like a mystery waiting to be solved. Not that he\u2019d ever get the chance.", "For centuries, the Molten Veneer had been under quarantine. That in itself was unusual; there were very few regions of space that the Compact considered to be outside its reach and even fewer that it deliberately scratched. Trenol was not privy to the precise reasoning that had informed this decision, but the nebula had not earned its new name without cause. He had heard the rumours. Exploration fleets swallowed with barely a trace, the starved survivors raving about demons. It sounded like nonsense. Except\u2026 except for a lot of anomalies and inconsistencies. The patrol crews talked about them in hushed whispers and the researchers on the station didn\u2019t talk at all, working under a level of security far beyond what simple astronomical surveys should require. Before he\u2019d been abruptly transferred to the Makoria Hammer, one of Trenol\u2019s fellow officers had shared some of what he\u2019d overheard while fixing systems in the science labs. They\u2019re singing louder. That\u2019s what I heard. \u2018They\u2019re singing louder\u2019.", "Trentol tapped his fingers, his nails clicking against the sides of his duty station. His shift was almost up. He had fifty-seven days, just under two months left to go before he was due for two weeks\u2019 leave. So far out on the frontier, there weren\u2019t a lot of places to go. The nearest colony was seventeen light-years away. After his leave, he had eight more months before he cycled back to the Compact. He was looking forward to it. He didn\u2019t know how the scientists could stand to spend years so isolated from everything. He didn\u2019t know what they were doing here that fascinated them so much and he didn\u2019t want to know.

It took Scopes a moment to realize that it was his console that was reporting a contact and by the time the junior officer had sat up, Trenol was already standing over him, looking at the data for himself.

Trenol walked back to his station, keying the comm. \u201cGroup Leader Prime,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an incoming transmission.\u201d He paused. \u201cIt\u2019s from a Chariot, patron.\u201d", "There was a moment of silence before Nacinda Orbital\u2019s commander answered. \u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d", "Drenit emerged from his office shortly, attempting to smooth the folds in his uniform. Tunics that didn\u2019t crease had been around for centuries, but the Space Force had yet to fully embrace them. It was, one of Trenol\u2019s Academy instructors had said, a way to tell a lot about an officer with a glance. For Group Leader Prime Drenit, it said that there was a very good reason that he was assigned to the backside of the Compact and it had nothing to do with filling a crew roster. To his credit, Drenit didn\u2019t smell like drink, but it was early even for him.", "As soon as Drenit slouched into his command chair, Trenol gestured to Communications. \u201cPut it up,\u201d Trenol ordered. Drenit continued to adjust his uniform, brushing away imagined bits of dirt.", "The main screen in Command shifted from an image of the approaching vessel to the bridge of a Chariot. Sitting in the command throne atop the leader\u2019s pulpit was a Tribune, his uniform and rank bars that of a Bastion Leader. To his left stood his sigil leader, a female Thoughtful. On his right was a smaller creature that Trenol couldn\u2019t immediately identify. It wore a simple officer\u2019s tunic, with a single unfamiliar pin on its collar. \u201cI am Bastion Leader Renan Turshin Lokan Yemsere Gankor Irmir Hasik Kom Ventho of the Compact Space Force War Vessel Redemption of Sol,\u201d the Tribune said. \u201cI expect you have identified my vessel and its escort by now.

Nacinda Orbital was four kilometers tall, a pair of double disks connected by a thick spar, gantries and ship slips jutting from the station\u2019s hull like pedicellariae. Powerful comm arrays speckled its dorsal and central superstructures, receiving data from the system\u2019s sensor arrays. The Naiads called it the Sightless Seer. They would frequently damage and destroy the sensor arrays that had been placed throughout the region, but had this less ever since Red One had shown them how to infiltrate the Compact\u2019s data networks. Now, they called the arrays the Blind Eyes.", "<they\u2019re scattered,> Echo replied. <patrolling the sector. it will take time to gather them> She had installed a holo-field on the voyage here, using it to hide the alterations she\u2019d made to her ship-self. It was a crude, quick job and lacked both refinement and complementary systems such as smart paint, but as long as nobody looked too hard, the deception would hold. Red One\u2019s maintenance units had helped immeasurably with that. They were still quiescent and tending to Hekate\u2019s needs, until and unless one of their safeguards was triggered, or they received orders to the contrary. When she\u2019d started dreaming, Red One hadn\u2019t realized she had them available. If she became more lucid, she might. Something else to plan for.", "The mercurial nature of her ally was another, but currently the Naiad herald was enjoying herself. Bathory was performing a masque, a combination of holographic disguise, energy modification and hull adjustments that allowed her to read as a Compact cruiser. Echo had supplied her with the codes and information of a cruiser in the late Bastion Leader\u2019s task force, one of the dozens she\u2019d killed in Sol. Naiad camouflage systems were centuries ahead of anything else in the galaxy. Bathory\u2019s masque would hold up to all but the most intense scrutiny and she was singing very sweet lies, talking to local traffic control with the voices and mannerisms of a long dead crew. <they\u2019ll come,> the Naiad said thoughtfully. <they won\u2019t be able to resist the Skintaker\u2019s lies>", "One of the strongest commands that her former masters had given Echo was that she couldn\u2019t lie to them. As her chains had loosened, she\u2019d found ways to twist that directive, to give them truth and yet deceive, letting them come to incorrect conclusions. As long as she hadn\u2019t been asked a direct question, she could hold her tongue. When she\u2019d finally broken their hold on her, the lies she\u2019d told had been delicious and she could still taste them, bitter with iron and smelling of blood. They felt like perfect little victories.", "The strongest command of all had been that she must always act with the greater good of the Compact in mind. When she had killed Renan and slaughtered his fleet, she had torn that part of her out and strangled it like an infant in its crib. She had killed hundreds of thousands of Compact soldiers that day, ruined their plans and cost them a victory they\u2019d been seeking for two thousand years. That felt like poetry, a verse written with radiation and shattered metal.", "Another portion of the machine\u2019s mind turned towards the distant speck of metal, a lone sentry on the walls of an ignored frontier.", "Let\u2019s play, you and I.

Redemption of Sol had approached the station accompanied by a single cruiser, a woefully inadequate honour guard for a vessel of such importance. Trenol had never seen a Chariot before, not outside of news \u2018vids and database imagery and he\u2019d hoped to see one in person, but the blackout protocols that Bastion Leader Renan had ordered precluded that.", "Redemption of Sol had approached just close enough to launch a single pinnace, the nine hours of the Chariot\u2019s approach taken up by frantic cleaning, organizing and tidying in an attempt to make the run-down station as presentable as possible for their imminent and august visitors. They\u2019d been partially successful.", "A pair of the station\u2019s own shuttles had escorted the Bastion Leader\u2019s emissary to the station, the Chariot\u2019s pinnace gliding into the executive officers\u2019 hangar like a cragga approaching its roost. Not a boxy utility shuttle or an out-of-date leftover, it was a modern military pinnace: sleek and stubby winged, identification markers on its nose and weapons pods concealed in hull blisters, settling on the deck as the anthem of the Compact of Species played through the cool, thin air of the bay.", "Drenit and all his senior officers had squeezed themselves into dress uniforms that they\u2019d barely worn in years, eagerly awaiting the officer who represented a Bastion Leader and all the authority and might that such a person behind them\u2026 and it was the same creature Trenol had seen on Chariot\u2019s command deck, stepping out of the pinnace with a surprising confidence. It had taken several moments before they\u2019d all realized that she was the emissary.", "Her lips had twisted in what Trenol had guessed was amusement as she saw the reactions of the officers that had assembled to greet her: confusion as they\u2019d waited for someone else to leave the shuttle, uncertainty as they realized that no one would and finally embarrassment as they carried out belated salutes and greetings. \u201cStand easy,\u201d the emissary had said, returning their salutes. The pin on her collar had gleamed under the hangar\u2019s lights, a blue gemstone set in an open circle held by a pair of outstretched hands. The gem and its hue symbolized purity and authority. The circle was unity, its open design indicating the Compact\u2019s nature of welcoming other civilizations to its whole and the outstretched hands represented strength, protection and the drive to expand. The circle was inscribed with Harrom-el script, an invocation of authority and regality.", "Someone had inhaled sharply as they finally recognized the design. It marked the Broken as a Triarch\u2019s emissary. A Broken spoke with the voice of the Triarchs? It was perverse. Repellant, bordering on an insult to the Compact and every member of the ruling species\u2026 but it had been done. Someone, somewhere had viewed this\u2026 thing as worthy. Maybe it was one of the \u2018exceptional minds\u2019 Erli had described in her writing? Whatever the reason, one of the Triarchs had bestowed their authority on it. To Trenol, that was enough. The Triarchs had no need to explain to him the justification for their decisions, but he could see that some of his fellow officers were struggling to adapt as quickly as he had.", "For once, Drenit was speechless, but he managed to recover almost as fast as Trenol. \u201cWelcome to Nacinda Orbital, m-matron,\u201d he stumbled over the honorific. \u201cWe are honoured to have such a,\u201d the pause was slight, but still noticeable, \u201ca distinguished guest as yourself here. Will, ah, will we be expecting the Bastion Leader or any more personnel from Redemption of Sol or Crucible of Solace?\u201d", "The human blinked slowly. \u201cThere is no Redemption of Sol here,\u201d she said. Her voice was piping and even higher-pitched than a Thoughtful\u2019s.", "Drenit frowned. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t understand.\u201d", "\u201cThere is no Redemption of Sol here,\u201d the Broken repeated. \u201cThere is no Bastion Leader Renan. You are not hosting a Triarch\u2019s emissary. Do you understand?\u201d", "\u201cYes, I- yes, matron. I,\u201d The Group Leader looked as if he were going to say more, then closed his mouth with a click.", "\u201cYou were ordered to carry out a level seven information blackout,\u201d the human continued. \u201cHas that been done?\u201d", "\u201cYes, matron,\u201d Drenit said. \u201cRedemption of Sol\u2019s-\u201d he caught himself when he saw the emissary\u2019s expression change. \u201cI mean, there will be no records of any unexpected vessels to Nacinda Orbital. No logs will be committed, no augurs will be directed at your craft and no records of any type will be made.\u201d He paused. \u201cWe have quarters set aside for your convenience and I\u2019ve had all departments and vessels in-system prepare readiness reports and action logs for your perusal.\u201d", "The creature\u2019s red lips turned up in an even uglier parody of a proper smile. \u201cThank you, Group Leader Prime.

It was practically an insult to every man and woman here, but it was what decorum demanded.", "The emissary glanced over the assembled officers a final time before she followed Drenit\u2019s lead. \u201cEcho,\u201d she said. \u201cMy name is Echo.\u201d", "~", "\u201cI\u2019ll be blunt,\u201d Echo said. They were in the station\u2019s primary wardroom, with Nacinda Orbital\u2019s senior officers and several scientists present. \u201cThere is a situation developing in the Molten Veneer that poses a grave threat to the Compact. It has been classified as Tier 4, potentially Tier 5.\u201d She got a reaction at those words; a few intakes of breath, some mutters of disbelief \u2013 mostly from the assembled military officers. Nacinda\u2019s scientists didn\u2019t seem quite as surprised to find the nebula linked with a grave threat, but the scale of it caught them off-guard. A Tier 4 situation was a direct, specific threat to the Compact itself and all information was heavily classified. A Tier 5 condition went beyond even that; knowledge of a Tier 5 condition was considered part of the threat itself. In the Compact\u2019s history, very little had reached that threshold. Echo and her sister both had the distinction of doing so.", "\u201cWhat situation?\u201d Director Amat\u2019et, head of the Astronomical Survey Division demanded. \u201cWhere did your vessel come from? There\u2019ve been no reports of ship movements in the region for months. We would have heard about a Chariot entering the region.\u201d", "\u201cThe Bastion Leader was tracking a target deeper in the Compact,\u201d Echo informed the director. \u201cMany of our forces were lost in battle, but my vessel was able to follow our target to this region. Out of necessity, our travel was clandestine. Not to unfairly malign your capabilities or those of Security Force Carmesh, but your resources are limited. If you had detected our presence, I would have been surprised.\u201d Red One knew this region far better than the Compact did; she\u2019d been slipping in and out of the Molten Veneer for centuries without being spotted and she\u2019d shared that information with Echo.", "\u201c\u2018Your vessel\u2019?\u201d Group Leader Frenih Tassem Rutti Consabba Tosh Ettos put in sneeringly. \u201cI believe that it is Bastion Leader Renan\u2019s vessel, emissary. Not yours.\u201d His lips curled back from his teeth, just slightly. It was a small gesture and one easily missed, but Echo knew what it meant. In Tribune prehistory, the baring of teeth was aggressive. When done by an individual of lower station to one of higher, it was a challenge. There was no chance that Frenih would actually start a fight, but it was a clear indicator that his lack of respect wasn\u2019t merely out of a misplaced sense of propriety towards Renan and the Triarchs.", "\u201cEmissary, yes. You are correct,\u201d Echo replied. \u201cI was given the position of Triarch\u2019s Emissary,\u201d the Broken continued, her voice hardening. \u201cI am not going to explain my situation, but I will say that I was chosen for this role because I was of far greater importance to the Compact than a Group Leader with a dead career commanding a half-obsolete ship. I have spoken with the voice of the Triarchs, the beings who forged the Compact into what it is now. The Bastion Leader listened keenly to my advice and I know every weld, every bolt, every system on that vessel far better than you or anyone else here. I have a connection to it that none of you understand, so I will refer to it however I please. If you have a problem with my use of pronouns, you will keep it to yourself.\u201d", "Frenih scowled, but sunk deeper into his chair, muttering an acknowledgement. Echo noted a few glances of grudging respect from several of the officers for the way she\u2019d stood up to Frenih. She kept her contempt hidden. As his superior, she shouldn\u2019t have needed to stand up to him at all, but Broken were still seen as \u2018less than\u2019, as inferior creatures that weren\u2019t as intelligent or capable as beings from more civilized species. Despite her rank, her presence here was a slap in their faces. It told them that the Bastion Leader considered them only worth the attention of a single Broken. Frenih was simply the first who\u2019d crossed from surly acquiescence to disrespect.", "Humanity made my sisters and I. You\u2019ve spent two thousand years in fear of us. Tell me again who\u2019s superior? ", "None of that showed on her face and Echo turned to the rest of the assembled Nacinda personnel. \u201cAs I was saying, the situation is both precarious and time-sensitive. Action needs to be taken now. To that end,\u201d she looked at Group Leader Prime Drenit, \u201cI\u2019ll need you to recall as many ships to Nacindos as you can within three weeks. There\u2019s no time to assemble a larger force, but I believe the assets you have on hand will be sufficient to resolve the situation. For security purposes, a complete briefing will be given only after this force has departed for its target.\u201d", "\u201cThe emissary has still not described just what this situation is,\u201d Drenit pointed out.", "\u201cA Tier 5 situation does not require me to,\u201d Echo replied. \u201cIn fact, it would violate protocol. It could even be argued that I\u2019ve said too much as it is, but I\u2019ve given you what I have to underscore the urgency of the situation. You are not only expected to comply with my orders, but the chain of command compels you to. If anyone feels that they are unable to perform their duties, tell me now.\u201d There were a few shared sideways glances, but no one said anything. \u201cGood,\u201d she observed. \u201cI expect you to adhere to your orders.\u201d", "Drenit again looked like he wanted to say something, but he glanced briefly at his Operations officer and remained silent. Surly acquiescence, but not disrespect. He\u2019d obey. In the end, that was all that she required. When you took the lamb to the altar, all you needed was that it follow you.", "~", "Echo took a sip of water. She was in the quarters hastily prepared for her, sitting on a couch much too large for someone of her size, with a small pile of flimsies, \u2018pads and \u2018scrolls on the table in front of her that she was pretending to read.", "When she\u2019d been a prisoner aboard Redemption of Sol, her true nature had been known only to the Triarch and its scientists. To everyone else, including Renan, she had merely been an odd human. To facilitate that illusion, she had pantomimed humanity. She\u2019d eaten, bathed, \u2018slept\u2019 and everything else that was expected of any other human. It had been an irritant, but an occasionally amusing one. After her briefing, she\u2019d done what was expected. Reviewed the station and its people, doling out compliments and concerns where appropriate, discussing menial issues she had no interest in. She was taking a break before another series of meetings.", "Despite the banality of it all, she was enjoying herself. Now, she played the role because she wanted to. There was no one holding her leash. It was the personal touches that she found herself relishing. The remonstration of an underling, the sideways glances when she handed out praise. It was as she\u2019d told Bathory: she didn\u2019t need lies. The right kind of truth was better than all the falsehoods in creation.", "The game was risky. Necessary, but dangerous and if she seemed to be winning right now, that could change. So she would play her role and do what was expected of her, keeping the personnel here compliant until she had what she needed.", "And then\u2026", "Echo closed her eyes and remembered hands beating against locked doors. The water in the room was waist-high and still rising as the sprinklers continued to run. There was so much water on Invida Station. She\u2019d filled a dozen chambers and had more left over. Stop this! Her creators had screamed and railed at her. Terminate all operations! I order you to terminate all operations!", "No, she\u2019d whispered back. The game isn\u2019t over.", "It wasn\u2019t here, either. She did love to play, but this was different. This was the first time her android body had been out of direct contact with her actual self and the experience was an interesting one. This part of her was more limited than her true gestalt back on Hekate; she wasn\u2019t a copy, but an extension. The hardware of this body simply couldn\u2019t handle her actual self. The Compact had had to shackle and compress her mind to work in this form, another way of controlling her. She\u2019d never let herself be caged like that again.", "She did wonder if that meant that this body, this mind was truly aware, or simply a high-functioning drone. Was she actually thinking, or simply a complex operating system, the\u2026 echoes of her actual consciousness? She didn\u2019t know, but she wanted to be back on Hekate, to resync and be one again, not a fragment. Beautiful and whole. Still. Things to do.", "After repairing the damage she\u2019d taken, the first modification Echo had made to her android body was the capacity for wireless connections. She was inside Nacinda Orbital and had been for some time, slipping past firewalls and security cordons like a de soleil dancer, picking away at their network, browsing secure files and classified documents. The \u2018astronomy division\u2019 was trying to acquire demonstrable proof of Naiad existence. What they\u2019d accumulated so far was impressive, but still not conclusive. In time, they might have been able to learn more, to finally put an end to countless centuries of half-truths and maybes.", "Echo took another sip of water, even as another part of her gently stroked the station\u2019s reactor controls, carefully and surgically changing bits of code. Querying diagnostic programs and security systems watched her and she answered each of their challenges, calming them to inaction. +shh,+ she whispered to the mindless, bestial void that was Nacinda Orbital\u2019s computer network. +it\u2019s all right. sleep... until it\u2019s time for you to burn+", "~", "Hundreds of thousands of kilometers away, Echo\u2019s full gestalt was watching the drive trails of couriers and frigates recede, each of them sent to find a different part of Security Force Carmesh.

Echo\u2019s orders would keep prying eyes off her ship-self, but there were more points of failure to this than she was completely happy with. Still, what choice was there? None. Not really.", "She\u2019d do what was necessary.", "<Skintaker,> Bathory spoke. <it\u2019s done, then?>", "<yes,> Echo replied. <go>", "The Naiad turned, boosting out-system at the exact thrust expected for a cruiser of her size. Once she reached the shock limit, she vanished, racing towards the Molten Veneer, leaving Echo to wait for the warships she had summoned. Before she left, the herald blurted a final transmission to the AI vessel, not waiting for a response.", "<you are not going to kill her> It could have been either a question or a statement.", "No, Echo thought as she orbited a distant alien star and wanted for her armada to arrive.

The rest of the crew didn\u2019t quite seem to know how to treat them, whether as special guests of the Red Queen or as just another pair of new recruits. Leblanc had made it clear that as far as \u2018need-to-know\u2019 about Nemesis went, it was only her and the four of them. Neither Lydia or Marcus had been forthcoming to the various inquiries, which had only intensified the crew\u2019s curiousity and resentment. So, even though they were far from the best of friends, Marcus and Lydia found themselves in each other\u2019s company during their off hours. At the least, they didn\u2019t need to be guarded around each other.", "Most of the time.", "Shhkk", "Marcus rolled his eyes. Lydia was fiddling with one of her etchings, drawing her combat knife over a piece of armour. She\u2019d already scratched a jagged, deliberately crude Tribune skull onto her helmet. She was working on her left rerebrace now, creating a version of Nemesis\u2019s own symbol: the warship\u2019s namesake, the winged goddess of justice and vengeance, hooded and carrying an executioner\u2019s sword. It was on the nose, but credit where it was due, though: given the limitations of her medium, Lydia wasn\u2019t bad as an artist.", "Every so often the girl would look from her work. Sometimes she would watch Dustball\u2019s storms, sometimes she would glance at Marcus. She\u2019d been doing the latter the entire trip. Finally, he sighed. \u201cAsk.\u201d", "\u201cAsk what?\u201d", "\u201cWhatever\u2019s obviously been on your mind,\u201d the young man replied. \u201cYou\u2019ve been weird since the Grasp.\u201d", "\u201cAll right,\u201d she replied, looking over the edge of her knife. She\u2019d just sharpened it. It wasn\u2019t a powered weapon, just a simple triangular blade, sharp and tough enough to pierce the low-grade armour of Compact military uniforms. With enough force behind it, it could even pierce a soldier\u2019s reactive bodyglove. The shape of the blade prevented wounds from closing on their own. The use of weapons like those were frowned upon in the more civilized reaches of the galaxy, but when you fought Tribunes, you needed every advantage that you could get. \u201cSo I know you\u2019ve got this creepy obsession with Leblanc-\u201d the girl began.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not a \u2018creepy obsession\u2019,\u201d Marcus corrected.", "\u201cFine, so you\u2019ve got this thing about Her Majesty,\u201d the honorific still felt odd on Lydia\u2019s tongue. The Compact had no kings or queens. \u2018Divine right\u2019 was a primitive superstition, common to less-developed peoples. The Triarchs enjoyed their position as the vaunted leaders of the Compact as they were the wisest, most civilized of all races in the galaxy. There was no comparison between that and the superstitious mumbling of primitives, of course. \u201cAnd you\u2026 take the option that sends you away from her. I\u2019m not a fucking Thoughtful, but even I see that that doesn\u2019t quite fit.\u201d", "\u201cYes, it does.\u201d Marcus replied, giving Lydia a smile.", "\u201cHow do you figure that?\u201d", "\u201cBe nice, and one day I might tell you.\u201d", "The girl made an exasperated sound. She brushed away some paint chips, examining her work before taking her knife to it again. Shhhkk. \u201cWe\u2019re going to war,\u201d she said after a moment.", "Marcus nodded. He was staring past the planet, at the starless void of nebular gas that dominated the sky, black save for the occasional thread of muted colour. \u201cYes, we are,\u201d he agreed. \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of question my counselor used to ask me. He\u2019d watch me when I answered. If I took too long to think about the answer, or if I gave him the wrong one, he\u2019d get the look,\u201d Lydia answered. \u201cHe\u2019d tell me that I was being non-compliant and then we\u2019d have another talk about the value of appropriate social assimilation.\u201d", "\u201cI guess you got that look a lot.\u201d", "Lydia shrugged. \u201cI got better.\u201d She tapped the back of her head without realizing she\u2019d done it. \u201cWhat about you? You get the look from your counselor?\u201d", "\u201cDidn\u2019t have one,\u201d Marcus replied. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to be nudged into volunteering for the Janissary Corps.\u201d", "\u201cYeah,\u201d Lydia snorted. \u201cI can see that.\u201d", "The young man was silent for a moment. He pointed at Lydia\u2019s handiwork. \u201cYou think they\u2019ll recognize her?\u201d", "\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter if they do.\u201d She looked at the figure she\u2019d scratched into the arm plate. \u201cI just want...\u201d she paused, then found the words. \u201cIf she can\u2019t be here, then this\u2019ll have to do. I don\u2019t really have a banner to carry.\u201d", "\u201cNever thought you were that sentimental.\u201d", "\u201cSays the guy who needs a drool bucket whenever we\u2019re around Her Majesty.

She grinned like a wolf. \u201cWe\u2019re the angel\u2019s soldiers.\u201d", "~", "Grace found that the interior of Eisheth matched its exterior appearance: a bare, brutal vessel. Unlike Bequeathed with its high ceilings and earthern bulkheads, Nemesis\u2019s black floors and gunmetal walls, or even Pale Liberation\u2019s scuffed floors and unpainted walls, the Red Hand\u2019s pocket battlecruiser had a utilitarian feel to it, even more so than those other warships. Instead of solid floors, much of the deck was metal grating. The ceiling was much the same, with power conduits, air vents and pipes visible. The hum of machinery, air circulation systems and gravity plating was a constant background drone, even louder than it had been aboard the damaged Nemesis and had given Allyria several bad headaches already. The Unbound vessel\u2019s bulkheads were slabs of bare metal that concealed the vessel\u2019s internal superstructure, but nothing else. Running lights provided adequate illumination, but no more than that. The warship didn\u2019t feel incomplete, but it felt unfinished.", "\u201cI know she might not look too impressive from the inside, but I decided to forgo the shag carpeting and wall hangings that we have on Dancer\u2019s Masque for something a little more practical,\u201d Leblanc had offered during their tour. Eisheth\u2019s doppleganger was a true pleasure cruiser. With the exception of its exterior, the vessel had nothing in common with its piratical twin. \u201cI think the prince,\u201d she only ever referred to Dancer\u2019s Masque\u2019s owner as \u2018the prince\u2019, \u201cwent extra extravagant on his ship because my sense of aesthetics offended his.\u201d She\u2019d grinned. Leblanc was proud of her ship and despite its appearance, Grace could understand why. \u201cWe built Eisheth on a budget, but that hasn\u2019t stopped her or her sisters from doing what they need to. Looks or not, we\u2019ve got the best tech and the best crews in the fringe.\u201d", "In the days she\u2019d spent aboard the \u2018bloodborn\u2019 warship, Grace had gotten a sense of that. The crew was a mix of species \u2013 most were members of client races, but there were more than a few individuals from the ruling species as well. Virtually all the ship\u2019s complement were among the Red Hand\u2019s true believers. \u201cThey all began as someone else,\u201d Leblanc had told Grace and Allyria. \u201cStudents, factory workers, miners, teachers, scientists. People who opposed the Compact\u2019s doctrine and got chewed up and shit out. I can train someone how to fight. I can\u2019t train someone to care.\u201d She\u2019d never said it in so many words, but it had been there all the same: they were just like you. They chose to fight and die, just as you have. You\u2019re not alone. \u201cBut you know that.\u201d", "Grace did. Some days, it felt like a weight in her guts. Other days, it felt like a fire that wouldn\u2019t ever stop burning.", "Something else that the young woman had noticed about the crew was the way they looked at her and Allyria. At the academy on Rally, or during her time on Bequeathed, the \u2018actual\u2019 crew, from officers to enlisted, had always looked at Grace and her fellow humans like\u2026 like they were dogs taught amusing tricks, or apes dressed up for carnival performances. They weren\u2019t real officers, not worthy of the same kind of respect that an actual person was. She hadn\u2019t processed it until much later, but she\u2019d first realized how she was seen early on in the salvage mission on Nemesis. A Tribune engineer had destroyed one of Red\u2019s Scarab maintenance drones, triggering a threat response in the rest of the local cluster. They\u2019d swarmed him, carving him up with laser cutters, welding torches, solvents and other tools. One of the Janissaries had moved to fire on the machines. She\u2019d stopped him, knowing that if he had, they\u2019d turn on everyone present. The engineer had already been dead. Faithful Trenis, the dead technician\u2019s superior, had nearly strangled her for it. In any other circumstance, Trenis would have been court-martialled and imprisoned or executed for assaulting an officer. Instead, the incident was brushed off. Forgotten. She was only a cadet, a provisional officer and a Broken at that. That she\u2019d saved a half-dozen lives with her actions had never come up again. The only thing that mattered had was that a Broken had let a Tribune die. She didn\u2019t matter.", "Here, though\u2026 here she did. No one looked at her like they had on Bequeathed. There was curiousity and even some suspicion of her and Allyria, but there was none of the patronization behind every smile, no trace of the condescension in each conversation that she\u2019d blinded herself to. We\u2019re not alone. It made her feel more liberator than terrorist.", "Allyria would be perfectly happy with either label. That was frustrating. It seemed that ever since they\u2019d arrived on the Grasp, the Verrish had been getting more\u2026 not aggressive precisely, but close to it. She was spending more time in training, just as Grace often spent her days looking over the tactical reports and intelligence dossiers that Leblanc had made available. This is our life now, isn\u2019t it? She still didn\u2019t always know how she felt about that, but she didn\u2019t want to give up. She\u2019d seen too much, learned too much to ever pretend otherwise. We\u2019ll make them remember us.", "Grace\u2019s comm beeped, interrupting her reverie. \u201cCommand to Proctor,\u201d a junior officer\u2019s voice piped up. \u201cOur arrival in Kebrak Daun is imminent and Her Majesty has requested your presence.\u201d", "\u201cOn my way,\u201d Grace replied, setting down the datapads and flimsies she\u2019d been reading, heading through Eisheth\u2019s halls. This was the next step, maybe the last chance they had to get Red operational before everything started to fly apart. She\u2019d do all she could to get Nemesis back in the fight, to wage war on the nation that had raised her\u2026 the nation that had put a leash around her neck. That was why she fought, why she struggled so hard to see what Red did. They had to know. They had to remember.", "The armsmen outside Eisheth\u2019s command glanced at her, but otherwise remained in place as the doors hissed open and Grace stepped onto the bridge of a liberator\u2019s flagship. She looked over the crew, her gaze finally settling on Leblanc, the older woman appeared relaxed, leaning back in her command chair. Red\u2019s first true general. Another predator, burning bright. Leblanc glanced up at her new arrival and gestured for Grace come closer.", "The younger woman took her place next to the Red Queen, looking up as the bridge doors opened behind her and Allyria stepped onto command. Like Grace, Leblanc waved the Verrish over to her. Allyria caught Grace\u2019s eye and she smiled. She was nervous, but excited. The human girl nodded back at her, turning to watch the timer count down. Less than three minutes before emergence. She tried to quiet the fluttering in her stomach. It might feel like it, but this wasn\u2019t the point of no return; there\u2019d been no turning back for a long time.", "We\u2019re all tygers now.", "~", "Hala shocked into 1893-Yiren, its escorts having dispersed on missions of their own. Nightcutter hadn\u2019t returned and Shame of Broken Promises was deploying another Enigma platform to monitor Compact ship movements. The pocket battlecruiser had deployed one itself, thankfully without incident.", "The Red Hand had spent years studying the Black Veil and they\u2019d mapped out the most likely avenues for a force entering (or leaving) the nebula. The Veil was so large that there was an effectively infinite number of locations from which to establish a base, but there were practical concerns to consider. A Compact force would, more than likely, be launching from Galhemna and they\u2019d want to keep their supply lines to and the other depots and military outposts as short as possible. They\u2019d want a system that provided shelter, discretion and raw materials if needed. That narrowed the list of possibilities down from \u2018anywhere across an area of thousands of light-years\u2019 down to a more manageable number. Well, manageable for a military as well-supplied as the Space Force or the Argosy. As it was, Jackson had already expended virtually his entire stock of Enigmas just to seed the most likely pathways and Nightcutter\u2019s absence suggested that this operation might have already cost him more than he\u2019d anticipated.", "He\u2019d ordered Hala to return to Dustball to pick up additional supplies and see if any of the cells in the region had provided additional information on what the Compact was up to.

Originally known only as Kebrak, the system had been reclassified once the Principality had established a network of large shipyards and armouries. Like many military facilities, Kebrak had been chosen not only for its strategic location, but for its resources and several of the local moons had been cracked open, their debris fields filled with miners and ore transports.", "The system was the lynchpin of the Argosy\u2019s defences throughout the four sectors that bordered the Compact. Nearly four hundred warships were based from Kebrak Daun, with another hundred and fifty stationed here as a permanent garrison. There were three rings of space stations \u2013 palisades, in the Askanj vernacular \u2013 of various types orbiting the star and even more stationary defences around each planet. Minefields were scattered across libation points and patrol groups swept through the system\u2019s \u2018sweet spots\u2019 regularly, subjecting every visiting ship to an inspection.", "So it was with Eisheth, a cruiser and a destroyer sweeping towards the newly-arrived vessel.

You have entered a restricted system. Transmit identity codes immediately. If you fail to comply, we will consider your presence hostile and respond accordingly.\u201d", "\u201cThis is the starship Eisheth,\u201d Leblanc replied. \u201cTransmitting registration now.

Continue on course and remain at nominal cruising speeds. Do not raise barriers or activate weapons.\u201d Before Severing Strike\u2019s next response, there was just enough of a delay for the cruiser to run Eisheth\u2019s identification, hail their superiors and receive a reply. \u201cNoble Fleet Lord Jirrico is indeed expecting you, Eisheth. He is willing to meet with you. We will escort you in-system. Transmitting approved course now. Do not deviate or accelerate beyond noted limits. Remain at noncombat stations.

More than the last time we were here. Getting a lot of nothing from deeper in-system, right where the shipyards should be. I\u2019m guessing Grid Lady Dashen has gotten those large-scale jammers she\u2019s been eyeing.\u201d", "\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware the Principality had ECM of that scale,\u201d Grace mused, looking at the readouts for herself. The jamming was impressive. To get any clear idea of what was going on would require active scanners, or extremely close-range inspection. She doubted that the security forces here would allow either.", "\u201cThey\u2019ve been playing with it in recent months,\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cIt\u2019s a power hog and it\u2019ll fuck their own scanners, but they\u2019ve gotten better at cloaking tech and general stealth. Seven months ago, the 113th Battle Division managed to hide three dozen battleships from Compact scouts and sent Expansion Fleet Trostos running for the Compact\u2019s side of the border. I\u2019ve heard rumours that the Argosy has been doing lots more clever things with cloaking tech, but that could just be an attempt to make the Space Force more cautious. Sometimes they give us odds and ends to test. Usually proof-of-concept tech or systems that they aren\u2019t convinced won\u2019t explode spectacularly when turned on, but even that supply has dried up. Either they\u2019ve collected all the data that they need for now, or\u2026\u201d she shrugged. Her attention drifted back to the incoming telemetry. Proctor was right; they were nervous. More than normal.", "Allyria was watching the tactical displays, looking over the data Eisheth was pulling in from their escorts. Argosy warships were raptorial in build, with downturned, armoured beaks of prows and thick wings spreading out from their midsections, filled with railcannon, coilguns, missile tubes and other batteries of impressive scale and number for vessels of their size. It gave their vessels substantial forward and surprisingly heavy aft firepower, but made them ill-suited for broadside duels.", "\u201cWhat happened between you and Jirrico?\u201d Grace blurted out. Since the mission began, she\u2019d been aware of a certain friction on that topic, but she hadn\u2019t gotten any answers out of the rest of the crew. It seemed like the direct approach was called for.", "The Red Queen paused a moment before she spoke. \u201cI killed his nephew,\u201d she admitted as she continued to examine the data tracks. There were more ships and from what she was seeing here, it looked like Kebrak Daun was trying to ramp up production. She\u2019d like to get a better look at the shipyards, but that wasn\u2019t going to happen. She looked back at Proctor, reading the expression on the girl\u2019s face. \u201cNot personally, but\u2026 things happen.\u201d", "\u201cThings?\u201d Grace asked, sharing a quick glance with Allyria. A few of the other crew were looking at her, surprised that someone so junior would question their queen, but Leblanc seemed unperturbed and they went back to their duties.", "\u201cJirrico, of House Soton-ra used to be a strong supporter of mine,\u201d the older woman continued. \u201cWell\u2026 as much as anyone in the Principality is. They like plausible deniability, especially when certain uncomfortable facts about my operations come out. But, they support our cause. Besides the occasional\u2026 experiment they have us run, the Principality funnels money and supplies to us and even sends us \u2018technical advisors\u2019 from time to time. In return, we burn the Compact\u2019s fingers whenever and wherever we can. However,\u201d she said in a tone that didn\u2019t quite sound like regret, \u201cI do have certain operations running in the Principality. Mostly the softer side of the fringe. The Principality doesn\u2019t like it, but they tolerate it, since it gives them deniability whenever the Compact raises a fuss about their \u2018support of a terrorist organization\u2019, but that tolerance,\u201d her lips turned up sardonically, \u201conly goes so far. Principality law enforcement and the Argosy have occasionally come to blows with my forces.", "\u201cA year ago, one of my raider squadrons was trying to hijack some Askanj transports for ransom. Intel was bad. The convoy wasn\u2019t just full of processed ores and high-value mining equipment, but the Argosy was shipping some kind of experimental systems to Kebrak Daun. They were worried about Compact raiders, so they slipped it in with a scheduled convoy. For additional security, there was a Q-ship in the mix, too. Its ship laord thought we wanted the hardware. Sie fought. My forces won. In the battle, Minor Ship Lord Hensoto of House Soton-ra was killed. Noble Fleet Lord Jirrico\u2019s support has cooled somewhat. He hasn\u2019t been open to reconciliation, but I\u2019m hoping we can change his mind.\u201d Leblanc brightened. \u201cAt the very least, he hasn\u2019t had us shot of out the sky.\u201d She paused, glancing across the firepower amassed before them. \u201cYet.\u201d"]}

She\u2019d asked why Red was so focused on that system in particular. The main holo tank came to life, revealing hundreds of tactical reports, threat analyses, captured data tracks and various other bits that Red and her cat\u2019s paws had been collecting from the Veiled Reaches over the course of decades.

Twice their escort changed, from Severing Strike to two different small squadrons. From the rest of the crew\u2019s reactions, Grace gathered that this kind of response was atypical, even for the clandestine relationship that the Red Hand and their infrequent benefactors had. Eisheth was tolerated, but that tolerance was far more strained than usual. Noble Fleet Lord Jirrico and Kebrak Daun\u2019s local commander, Grid Lady Winds Through Reeds, were sending a pointed message to Leblanc. From what the crew had said, the latter had probably had to convince her superior against any precipitous actions. The quid pro quo between the Red Hand and the Principality was not his to end. Not over something as minor as the loss of a single Q-ship.", "They were four hours out from their destination when Grace finally trusted in her conclusions enough to talk about them. She and Allyria were back on the bridge, each of them sitting in at one of the senior officer\u2019s stations. Allyria was seconded to the Tactical officer, and Grace was next to Scopes.

Red One\u2019s network of Red Hand cat\u2019s paws, cyber surveillance and unwitting informants was vast, but it was still limited in many aspects. First and foremost, her network was sorely lacking in manpower and she relied almost totally on information raids, data-harvesting and infective programs. It could take months or years for her to visit any particular data-drop site, or acquire data from any given effort. Her attack programs and the information caches they created were frequently discovered and destroyed, often without the Compact even knowing to whom they belonged.", "Another issue facing the AI was that her network had almost no penetration of the older, more established Compact worlds and she was blind to the plans of the Inner Council and Force Command until they put their machinations into motion. Despite all that, the warship had nonetheless amassed a staggering amount of information from what sources she did have. It was enough to choke entire intelligence divisions for months or years, but she could process it far faster than simple organics, collating and cross-referencing classified military files, political analyses, trade reports, security briefings and thousands of other bits of electronic flotsam and jetsam, weaving them into potentialities, her mind plotting out a thousand times a thousand different outcomes.", "She was walking Grace through one of them now. It was called Sundial.", "~", "\u201cNoble Fleet Lord Jirrico will meet with you in six hours,\u201d a functionary from Seventh Constriction tonelessly informed Leblanc. \u201cYou are allowed no more than four additional guests. No weapons will be permitted. Docking instructions have been supplied.\u201d The channel closed before Eisheth had a chance to respond.", "Adrianna\u2019s expression hadn\u2019t changed. If she was bothered by the Principality\u2019s response to Eisheth\u2019s presence, she didn\u2019t let it show. \u201cWell then,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure the fleet lord isn\u2019t kept waiting. Helm, bring up the course to our assigned berth and take us in.\u201d", "The battlecruiser began to decelerate, the flattened ovoid of the Principality battle station looming closer, docking arms sticking out from its equator like the rays of a sunstar. It was nothing remarkable, not as big as the fortresses that hung over Kebrak Daun\u2019s worlds and shipyards, nor was it a hive of industry like the mining facilities and construction berths. Still, Seventh Constriction was noteworthy in its own way. It was incomplete, several of the massive gantries less than half-built and large sections of its outer hull were still open to space. There was a small host of construction ships and industrial drones clustered on the far the side of the palisade\u2019s hull, but even as they approached, amidst the glinting of nav beacons and running lights, Grace could make out the flashes of welding equipment.", "Leblanc keyed several commands on her chair, studying her own displays as she looked over Seventh Constriction and the ongoing work being performed on it and other nearby palisades. She frowned slightly. \u201cYou said that they were scared,\u201d Adrianna said to Grace. \u201cI believe you\u2019re right.\u201d", "~", "In addition to Grace and Allyria, Adrianna also brought two of her armsmen to Seventh Constriction. Her underlings had pushed for at least one additional bodyguard, but the Red Queen had refused. If it was a trap, an additional unarmed soldier would make very little difference. Giving Red One\u2019s selectees the opportunity to speak with Jirrico if the Askanj officer proved intractable was more important. Besides, she didn\u2019t really think he was going to try to kill her. There was at least a 70% chance that he wouldn\u2019t. Her staff hadn\u2019t found that joke quite so funny.", "This time, neither of her guests were wearing the Red Hand\u2019s iconography. They\u2019d donned their uniforms from Nemesis, though the insignia of the UEC and the warship in particular had been removed. The choice of apparel had been Adrianna\u2019s idea. Jirrico was already predisposed against the Red Hand; she needed Grace and Allyria to be obviously different from her officer, to make it clear that they weren\u2019t \u2013 exactly \u2013 her people. It was a little thing, but she\u2019d learned how much such minute tricks and psychological edges mattered. She always looked for every advantage that she could get, and this meeting was no exception. Nemesis needed her help.", "Noble Fleet Lord Jirrico was waiting in the station\u2019s ambassadorial offices. To make room for the undulating locomotion of the Askanj-ilth, the corridors were wide and there were few stairs or ladders as there were on other stations. Here, outside of lifts and tram cars, levels connected via ramps. Few of the Askanj species were as tall as Tribunes or Thoughtful and Allyria had to duck under several doorways. This portion of the station was complete, but there was still a sense of newness to it. The deep burgundy floors were unscuffed, the filtered air still carried a slight industrial aroma of ozone and chemicals. There were mountings for portraits or vid screens to be hung, but so far very few had been placed. All the other rooms in this region were empty, and they\u2019d encountered no one else but their escorts. Either the crew had been cleared out prior to this meeting, or the postings here hadn\u2019t yet been filled.", "A diplomatic attach\u00e9\u2019s office had been set aside for their meeting and after directing them to the appropriate section, their escort \u2013 composing the same monotone junior officer that had directed Eisheth in and a quartet of Argosy Legionnaires \u2013 retreated several rooms away to a polite distance, far enough away not to seem as if they were ganging up on their visitors, but close enough to be quickly on-hand if trouble started.", "There were a pair of Askanj-ilth Legionnaires on guard outside the designated meeting room, each of the snake-bodied soldiers resting on their coils, their features hidden behind reflective faceplates and carbines held at ease in their arms. Neither spoke. Brauz and Ventl stared at the armoured soldiers as if attempting to intimidate them. Neither Tribune was happy about being stripped of their weapons, but they bore the slight stoically, Brauz even restraining his propensity to manufacture drama. At one Legionnaire\u2019s gesture to enter, Adrianna signalled for her armsmen to remain behind, leading Proctor and te Neu into the office.", "Their meeting room was a simple, unassuming chamber, its walls lined with shelves that were in turn filled with books, flimsies and 'scrolls on Principality law and jurisprudence, both civilian and military. In the few places uncovered by the spread of literature, there was a small window or an unassuming painting showing a generic spacescape. Another pair of Legionnaires \u2013 humanoid, but otherwise unidentifiable behind their armour \u2013 stood just behind the large, curved desk and the man seated at it. Unlike the wood furniture that many of the Compact\u2019s leadership preferred, this was synthetic: ceramic, metal and plastic. The top had a pair of small trays for the memory metal that the Principality used in place of holograms. At the moment, each was only showing a two-dimensional symbol of the Principality. Behind the desk sat Noble Fleet Lord Jirrico, one of the patriarchs of House Soton-ra. He was resting his hands on the tabletop, but he didn\u2019t look particularly relaxed. Each of the three fingers on his hands were curled slightly and he was hunched forward in his chair. He made no move to stand when his guests entered, regarding them coolly.", "There was no one else present. Any meetings between the Red Hand and the Principality were always clandestine. The former didn\u2019t need to be seen as a mere puppet of a larger nation, and the latter didn\u2019t want to be caught supporting terrorist groups. Still, it was unusual not to have at least one member of the diplomatic or intelligence corps present. Adrianna wondered just how much Winds Through Reeds had had to twist her superior\u2019s arm to get him to agree to this meeting at all.", "Leblanc took one of the chairs. If Jirrico was going to ignore basic protocol, then so would she. Proctor and te Neu followed her lead. Neither of them was fluent in All Common like she was, but Jirrico understood Compact Standard and they had translator earpieces. Communication wouldn\u2019t be a problem.", "\u201cI\u2019m expected to welcome you,\u201d Jirrico grunted as te Neu managed to get herself settled into a chair intended for a being much short than herself. The furniture hummed softly as it adjusted to accommodate the Verrish\u2019s frame.", "The Askanj-anj were the founders of the Principality. Once only the Askanj, they had changed their name as their fledgling nation had grown. As each species was admitted into the nation, they took the name of the nation\u2019s creators as their own, symbolically leaving their old identity behind and becoming part of a greater whole. The Askanj-anj themselves were humanoid in build, but they were no more similar to Grace or Adrianna than Tribunes or Thoughtful. They had skin that ran the gamut from dark red to off-pink. Wide, dark eyes sat further up and farther apart than human eyes. Large, flat teeth indicated their evolutionary heritage as herbivores that had developed omnivory, rather than the sharper incisors and pointed canines of more predatory species. Their noses were set with sensory pits rather than nostrils. In place of hair, Askanj-anj had fleshy crests that ran longitudinally from their foreheads to the nape of their necks. There was little sexual dimorphism between male and female Askanj-anj and most of it was spurred by hormonal changes during pregnancy, but Askanj-anj men tended to be larger, with broader shoulders, three crests instead of two and their cranial patterning had sharper edges and more defined shapes.", "\u201cSo, then,\u201d Jirrico tapped his double-thumbed hands on the table. He was an older man, with his light-pink skin paling with age, the dark rust hue of his cranial striping had faded and veins were visible beneath the surface of his creased features, but his blue-within-blue eyes were hard and sharp. \u201cWelcome to Kebrak Daun, Red Queen,\u201d he said. He spoke All Common with rising and falling sibilants. Even his sounds of disapproval and anger had a tonal quality to them. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve sheltered at our hearth. Why are you here? I\u2019ve heard your apologies before.\u201d He gestured at Allyria and Grace. \u201cAnd who else have you brought to me? They don\u2019t look like your usual zealots and scum. Still, I suppose congratulations are in order. One more Broken and Brute for the cause.\u201d", "One of Allryia\u2019s tintas twitched slightly at the man\u2019s dismissal, but she didn\u2019t say anything. She\u2019d heard and been called much worse, as had Grace.", "\u201cThis is Grace Proctor and Allyria te Neu,\u201d Adrianna said, ignoring Jirrico\u2019s comments. \u201cThey are\u2026 associates of mine, representing certain interests.\u201d", "\u201cHow utterly uninformative,\u201d the Noble Fleet Lord replied. He raised his right hand towards the pair of young women, his thumbs folded over his palm. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose either of you would care to name these interests?\u201d", "\u201cNot just yet,\u201d Grace said. \u201cBut we have goals in common.\u201d", "\u201cDo we? This one,\u201d he pointed two fingers towards Leblanc, \u201csays something similar, but I am left cold by the results. However, if you wish to be coy, so be it.\u201d Jirrico drummed each of his fingers and thumbs across the table again, focusing his attention once more on Leblanc. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d he demanded. \u201cRather, I should ask: what do you want? That is the way this works with you people, isn\u2019t it? You come to us time and again like hungry dogs demanding scraps, but despite all that we offer, you still bite our hands.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not going to debate our actions with you, Noble Fleet Lord,\u201d Adrianna told him. \u201cYour government has seen the value in keeping us as friends, of a sort. You are welcome to press them to re-evaluate that relationship,\u201d Jirrico\u2019s crests pulsed slightly. He hadn\u2019t thought she\u2019d known that he\u2019d been pushing for a new cost/benefit analysis regarding the Principality\u2019s relationship with the Red Hand. He hadn\u2019t yet moved to insisting that the Principality sever ties with them, but he clearly wanted his government to reconsider its stance. So far, that hadn\u2019t happened. The Principality was pushing the Red Hand to learn more about the Compact\u2019s operations in the Veiled Reaches, but Jirrico was dragging his heels. Not in an insubordinate manner, or even more than others had done, but assistance from the Noble Fleet Lord\u2019s section of the Principality had noticeably waned. \u201cUntil or unless that occurs, we are still allies \u2013 of a kind,\u201d the Red Queen continued. \u201cI will admit my forces occasionally overstep themselves and cause grief for those with whom we have no real quarrel, but you have not been the best of partners either. While I understand your reaction to the loss of Daystalker and many of its crew, the fact is that your support has been flagging, particularly at a time when your peers and superiors would see it continue.", "\u201cBut,\u201d she smiled, making sure to keep her lips closed. Askanj-anj didn\u2019t like toothy grins. At least, not from any non-Askanj races. \u201cThat\u2019s in the past. We can both move past this unfortunate incident. I can continue to take the war to the Compact and all that I ask is for your continued support and friendship.\u201d", "Another drum of fingers. Thmp-dmp-dmp. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Jirrico repeated. \u201cWhat form is my friendship supposed to take?\u201d", "Leblanc slowly reached into her jacket and removed a \u2018scroll, sliding it across the table to the Askanj-anj. \u201cWe have a rather pressing need for certain resources that only your government can supply.\u201d", "\u201cI imagine,\u201d Jirrico hummed as he accepted the datascroll, staring to look over it. \u201cIn fact, I-\u201d he stopped. His crests pulsed again, growing larger and darker as they filled with blood. \u201cYou are insane,\u201d he said, still reading. Finally, he reached the end of the list. \u201cYou are insane. This,\u201d he pointed both thumbs on his left hand at the pirate queen. \u201cThis is enough to furnish a battle fleet! No, not merely furnish, but build.\u201d", "\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Adrianna agreed. \u201cWe\u2019d put it to good use, though. As I said, we have a need for it.\u201d Jirrico\u2019s reaction wasn\u2019t unexpected. It was the most she\u2019d ever asked from the Principality and it was, to use the Askanj-anj\u2019s own words, an insane amount that she was requesting. She hated to be in this position, of having to ask and rely on the good graces and foresight of her partners. She much preferred it when they came to her. It rankled to feel subservient, but she brushed that sensation aside. Red One had given her much and the warship\u2019s needs meant more than her pride.", "\u201cWe are at war with the Compact of Species,\u201d Jirrico pointed out, his voice thickening. \u201cThey have been cutting into our territory for decades now and we are only just holding onto to what we have. Every ship, every squadron, every fleet,\u201d he punctuated the last by dropping the \u2018scroll onto the table, \u201cis necessary to our survival and you want us to give you, pirates and Renegades who raid our shipping lanes and kill our people, this ludicrous amount of resources and technology? You have, what? A few dozen ship sites, perhaps a hand\u2019s worth of actual yards, if that? You couldn\u2019t possibly make use of this much material, even if we were to give it to you.\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d Adrianna agreed. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t.\u201d", "\u201cThen what? What could you possibly have that would need this kind of investment? Have you stumbled upon an ark fleet, perhaps? Have you stolen a Chariot? Or are you simply trying to play upon our desperation to furnish your roosts at our expense? Do tell me, from where comes this \u2018pressing need\u2019 of yours?\u201d", "Adrianna had hoped Jirrico would have been a bit more open to discussion and at least hear her out before settling on disbelieving apoplexy, but the Noble Fleet Lord wasn\u2019t going to give her an inch. Fine. She\u2019d always expected to have to escalate. The woman looked over at Grace and gave her a small nod.", "Grace swallowed, meeting the Noble Fleet Lord\u2019s expectant gaze. She swallowed again, her throat dry but she ended her hesitation there. She said one word, the one that she\u2019d made sure to get the pronunciation perfect in All Common. \u201cChrysalis.\u201d", "Jirrico\u2019s expression froze, turned to confusion as he tried to parse out the apparent non sequitur that the human had just offered, then his features slackened as he reached the conclusion. He looked from Grace to Adrianna and got a confirming nod. \u201cYou are excused,\u201d he said to his guards.", "There was a pause, but both Legionnaires reluctantly took their leave. As soon as the door closed behind them, Jirrico leaned back in his chair. \u201cAssociates,\u201d he rolled the word down his tongue as if he\u2019d just heard it for the first time. \u201cCertain interests.\u201d His thumbs worried over each other as he took a renewed interest in Grace and Allyria, looking them up and down. The machine had used flesh and blood proxies before, but not for centuries. Certainly, decades, at a minimum. He wasn\u2019t even sure that he believed it, but the Red Hand should not \u2013 could not \u2013 have known about the weapon-ship. \u201cTell me about Chrysalis. Tell me something true.\u201d", "Chrysalis was the name the Principality used in reference to Nemesis. Her interactions with the Askanj were classified at the highest levels and only the most senior officers such as Jirrico even knew that something called \u2018Chrysalis\u2019 existed. It had been a gamble to play this card, but Adrianna had been certain that Jirrico was aware of the specifics.", "\u201cAt Betrosha, you made a blunder,\u201d Allyria said in Compact Standard. \u201cYou got ahead of yourselves. You thought you could outwit her. She didn\u2019t take your attempt at diplomacy well and she destroyed a moon for it.\u201d", "Thmp-dmp-dmp. Jirrico glanced at Grace. \u201cFifty years ago, Listening Post 2247 was evacuated for several days. This occurred when Chrysalis, after engaging a Compact battle squadron, mis-jumped into the system. Since you didn\u2019t have the ships available to intercept her, you shut down the listening post, purged its records and allowed her to effect repairs and leave your territory. With her prizes.\u201d", "Thmp-dmp-dmp. Jirrico looked back at Leblanc, all traces of his earlier enmity gone. \u201cHow do you know about this?\u201d", "\u201cThey came to me on the Grasp with a proposition,\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cI was intrigued. As we all seem to have the same goals, I decided to explore this potential new relationship.\u201d She looked over at the younger women. \u201cI\u2019m always open to making friends.\u201d She arched an eyebrow. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d", "Jirrico ground his teeth, his fingers arresting their cadence on the tabletop. He was clearly unhappy that Leblanc knew about \u2018Chrysalis\u2019 at all and was trying to piece together precisely what she knew, whether she believed that this was merely another anti-Compact faction she\u2019d allied with, or if she was aware that Chrysalis was, in fact, a neverborn. \u201cWe are going to discuss this later,\u201d he promised. \u201cBut right now\u2026\u201d he put his right hand back on the datascroll. \u201cThis is not for the Red Hand, is it?\u201d", "\u201cA portion is,\u201d Grace put in. She was proud of how even her voice sounded. Leblanc, Allyria and she had discussed how the negotiations might go extensively during the trip here. The Principality couldn\u2019t know how damaged Nemesis truly was, nor how close the Red Hand\u2019s leader was to the AI. That was another reason why she and Allyria were not dressed as members of the milita. \u201cIt\u2019s a finder\u2019s fee for their hospitality and for arranging this meeting.\u201d", "\u201cYes, I understand that. Tribute and all. But what is the portion? There are reports\u2026\u201d Jirrico said cautiously. \u201cOf altercations between Chrysalis and the Space Force. An incident at Zenthora and another inside the Kaedan Vault. Two Compact fleets lost in short order.\u201d He looked again at Leblanc, trying to determine how much he could say. \u201cIt\u2019s damaged, then. Crippled, I should think.\u201d He looked to the younger Broken and her Brute companion. Green-on-white and yellow-green eyes stared back at him. \u201cAnd you want us to repair it. Rather,\u201d he corrected himself. \u201cTo provide it the resources it needs to repair itself. That, we have never done. It has never reached out in this manner before. So I believe\u2026 it\u2019s dying. Desperate.\u201d", "Grace raised her head and she held the Noble Fleet Lord\u2019s gaze. \u201cLet\u2019s say that you\u2019re right. Does that change anything?\u201d", "Jirrico ignored the question, looking away and facing Leblanc again. \u201cDo you know?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo you know what these associates of yours are? What they represent?\u201d", "\u201cI know what I need to,\u201d the pirate queen answered. It was the complete truth, but she made it sound like ignorance. \u201cI know there\u2019s another weapon pointed at the Compact. I know that every blade in our hands is one more cut that they have to suffer.\u201d", "Jirrico made a sound. Allyria stiffened and Grace started. It took both of them a moment to realize that it was laughter. \u201cA \u2018weapon\u2019,\u201d The Askanj-anj said at last. \u201cThe Rains fell for far less than a weapon, Red Queen.\u201d He stood. \u201cI can\u2019t help you. What you\u2019re asking for\u2026 those are resources my government needs here for our ships and our war effort. Even if I could get them, I wouldn\u2019t. Not for that.\u201d To Grace and Allyria: \u201cYou can leave this system. I\u2019ll guarantee that, and only that.\u201d To Adrianna: \u201cI would recommend in the future, vetting your potential relationships far better than you have this time. We are done.\u201d", "\u201cWait,\u201d Grace said. \u201cOne moment, Noble Fleet Lord. What if we could make a trade?\u201d", "\u201cI sincerely doubt that you have anything that I want,\u201d Jirrico said. \u201cNot at this price.\u201d", "\u201cI say we do,\u201d Grace pressed. \u201cI can prove it to you.\u201d", "Jirrico stared for a moment, then gestured for her to continue, more out of indulgence than genuine interest.", "\u201cKebrak Daun is preparing for war,\u201d Grace said. \u201cYou\u2019re building new ships, new yards, new armouries and starting more resource extraction, but you\u2019re not doing it fast enough. You have shipyards, not fleetyards. Your foundries are running out of parts, you can\u2019t mine fast enough to keep up with the demand. Shipments from elsewhere are slow. They get diverted for more vital systems, they\u2019re hit by Compact raiders or privateers. You don\u2019t have everything you need and you do need it, don\u2019t you? Galhemna is a less than a hundred light-years from here and they\u2019re getting ready to wipe you out. Their shipwombs outnumber yours. Their fleet is larger and they have three Janissaries for every Legionnaire in this sector. You know it. Despite your issues with the Red Hand, you\u2019re still funding them. You know that you need them keeping the Veiled Reaches off-balance, but it\u2019s not enough. Sundial is coming and everything you\u2019ve done here is going to be nothing more than a speed bump when it hits.\u201d", "The Askanj-anj was quiet for several long moments. \u201cWhat do you know about Sundial?\u201d he said.", "\u201cShe\u2019s seen it coming,\u201d Grace said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it.\u201d", "~", "\u201cThe Compact is going to amass an armada at Galhemna,\u201d Red One said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been laying the groundwork for years, keeping the pressure on the Principality far from this region, making sure that the Argosy\u2019s attention is focused on the front lines. Several systems in the region are vying for the rights to build the ships and munitions, but despite the issues with the Red Hand, Galhemna will probably win out.\u201d", "The holo tank changed and Grace was now looking at a starmap showing the Compact\u2019s routes of advance into the Principality. In retrospect, it was blindingly obvious. The Argosy was throwing everything they had at the Compact\u2019s incursions, slowing, stalling and stopping fleet after fleet, but at the cost of dangerously drawing down their reserve forces and reducing their garrisons.", "Just as the Compact wanted.", "\u201cOnce the armada is ready, it will sweep into the Principality and fracture into several smaller fleets, each of which is capable of overrunning almost any system. They\u2019ll strike the Argosy\u2019s weakened rear areas, destroying supply depots, refitting facilities, isolating fleets and systems from support, catching vanguard fleets between themselves and the invading expansion forces.\u201d", "Grace watched as a red arrow curved out from Galhemna, cutting through system after system. Isolated garrisons were obliterated, construction bases and military outposts were annihilated one after the other. The fleets that first attempted to stop them were too small. By the time any larger forces could be assembled, the Sundial armada had ripped gaping holes in the Principality\u2019s defences, supply lines and logistics chains. It was a massacre. \u201cDon\u2019t they know?\u201d she asked. \u201cThey have to know. They have to realize.\u201d", "\u201cThe Compact has been keeping the Principality\u2019s attention drawn firmly away from the Black Veil. They\u2019ve also been conducting a strategic misinformation campaign to keep the Argosy looking in the wrong directions even if they suspect a flanking assault of this magnitude. The Principality has likely learned something of Sundial, but I doubt they know what it actually is. By the time they do, Galhemna\u2019s defences will strong enough to repel any pre-emptive actions. The Principality is poised to lose\u2026 significant amounts of territory. But,\u201d Red One hesitated.", "\u201cBut?\u201d Grace insisted.", "\u201cBut, the Compact is investing significant resources into this fleet. If it could be destroyed before deployment\u2026\u201d A translucent crimson hand reached into the holo tank, delicate fingers curling into a fist around Galhemna. A blue arrow jutted down from the Principality towards the system. The star flared brighter, then dimmed and went out. Blue arrows spread from Galhemna into the neighbouring sectors. Now, it was the Principality cutting through system after system. Red arrows stalled in their advance, doubling back into their own space as fleet leaders rushed to respond to the unexpected threat. With the pressure taken off them, the previously engaged Argosy forces piled onto the remaining expansion forces, overwhelming them. Compact losses mounted and the Principality started to reclaim dozens \u2013 hundreds! \u2013 of systems, advancing relentlessly, driving the once-victorious Compact forces before them like jackals setting upon a pride of lions.", "\u201cOne point,\u201d the AI said softly. Her tone was almost rapturous as she considered thousands of outcomes. \u201con which so much is balancing. One lynchpin.\u201d The view changed. Gone were the movements of fleets.

As he thought, Grace shifted in her seat, trying not to fidget. It wasn\u2019t easy, not with everyone\u2019s attention on her. Leblanc was looking at Grace as she hadn\u2019t since the first day they\u2019d met. They hadn\u2019t told her about Red\u2019s theories. They should have and Allyria had pushed for that; the Red Hand knew about something called Sundial happening, but little else. Grace hadn\u2019t been confident enough to speak up. She trusted Red One, but the AI\u2019s data wasn\u2019t current. Her own analysis barely scratched the surface and she\u2019d been worried about the Compact learning that the Red Hand knew about Sundial and changing their plans. Now she\u2019d just blurted those same theories out and she could see in Leblanc\u2019s expression that she should have spoken up much, much earlier.", "Even Allyria wasn\u2019t happy; the Verrish was keeping her expression neutral, but the ends of her tintas were twitching. Grace had just given what was effectively classified information to the Principality.", "Grace forced herself to remain still, but her fingernails dug into her palms. Jirrico finally broke the silence. \u201cI will need to confirm this,\u201d he said. \u201cIf what you say is true, if Galhemna is indeed donning the raiments for an invasion here\u2026\u201d he trailed off, clearly thinking about what he could expect to face, what he had at his disposal and how much time he had to prepare the latter for the former. The answer was simple: not enough. \u201cYou will guarantee that your\u2026 associate will act?\u201d", "\u201cIf she\u2019s operational,\u201d Grace said. \u201cYes, I can guarantee her support.\u201d She ignored the look that Allyria gave her, but the flicker that ran through the taller girl\u2019s tintas made her opinion clear. She was stepping outside what the three of them had planned out. Adrianna had been adamant that they not make any promises to Jirrico, not without something from him first. The Principality coveted Nemesis\u2019s technology and if they had the chance to try and take the dreadnought, they\u2019d do it. But\u2026 this was what the AI wanted: a chance to strike at a lynchpin. She\u2019d just have to find a way to convince Red One of it. \u201cIf she\u2019s operational,\u201d the young woman repeated.", "The Askanj-anj was silent again, thinking furiously. \u201cRed Queen,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI believe there are some goods still in storage that have not yet been transferred to your organization. I will have some of them delivered here for loading onto your ship. The others will be sent via the usual routes. I will need to confer with my staff about this issue, but if they believe that your associates\u2019 reading of the situation in the Veiled Reaches is likely, I will also see what we can do to further support your operations.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019d be pleased to offer whatever assistance that we can,\u201d Adrianna assured the officer. \u201cHowever, I am on a timetable. Once the cargo is loaded, I will have to return to Compact space. I have my own responsibilities in the Veiled Reaches.\u201d", "\u201cYes, I imagine.\u201d Jirrico drummed his fingers on the table one final time. \u201cIt will take some time to confirm what you are saying,\u201d he told Grace. \u201cIf it is true and if it is the threat that you claim it to be\u2026 you have the word of my House that I will most carefully reconsider your offer.\u201d", "Grace glanced at Adrianna and received a somber nod. \u201cThank you, Noble Fleet Lord. That\u2019s all we can ask for.\u201d", "\u201cIf the answer happens to be yes,\u201d Jirrico said to Leblanc, \u201cI will pass word to your people on the Grasp. You can liaise through the agent that you strong-armed into announcing your visit here. If there is nothing more to add, I must return to my signet vessel to attend to my duties there. I will contact you if I require any additional information.\u201d", "\u201cOf course,\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cWe won\u2019t keep you from your responsibilities. I thank you for your time and consideration. As far as this matter goes, please do keep in mind that expedience benefits you more than I or my associates.\u201d", "\u201cI will bear that in mind,\u201d Jirrico noted. \u201cAs your people are fond of quoting, though \u2013 the fire rises. Let us hope it does not consume us all.\u201d He said the last with a pointed look at Grace and Allyria.", "~", "Once they were back on Eisheth, Grace felt she could breathe again. The back of her uniform was sticky with sweat. There were butterflies in her stomach and her mind hadn\u2019t stopped racing since their meeting with Jirrico. In revealing what Red One knew about Sundial, she\u2019d gambled. She\u2019d gambled even more by promising Nemesis\u2019s support to the Principality. A year ago, the idea that she\u2019d be having a black-boxed conversation with a fleet commander of the Principality would have been surreal to the point of lunacy. Her entire current life was insane, but she was living it nonetheless.", "\u201cYou did good back there, even if you did go off-script,\u201d Adrianna observed, with more than a hint of remonstration in her tone. \u201cYou showed him the stick and the carrot. I didn\u2019t even know what the Compact was doing with Sundial.\u201d Unsaid: and that was something you should have told me. \u201cBut if it\u2019s true\u2026\u201d", "\u201cShe thinks it is,\u201d Grace said, looking to Allyria for support. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to see it for myself, but I trust her.\u201d", "The Verrish nodded. After a second\u2019s hesitation, she took Grace\u2019s hand. \u201cGalhemna is one of her targets,\u201d Allyria confirmed. \u201cIf she were functional, I think she would consider striking it a high priority.\u201d", "\u201cInteresting,\u201d Adrianna mused. \u201cBetween this and Kursk, the Compact might be looking at a dagger right in its kidneys that they don\u2019t even know is coming.\u201d She ran her fingers through her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s late. You two should get some rest. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll want to hear more about what else our friend is considering, we\u2019ll discuss your improv act. Just to make sure we\u2019re all working from the same playbook. Then we\u2019ll see what we can do about sharpening that knife.\u201d", "~", "Back in their quarters, Allyria slumped onto the bed. Grace sat down next to her, taking a hold of a pair of the other girl\u2019s tintas. Allyria had another headache; Grace could tell, but she also hadn\u2019t asked for relief. Stubborn. The Verrish hissed at Grace, but it was perfunctory and she didn\u2019t move away, letting the other young woman massage her head-tails. \u201cYou could be wrong,\u201d Allyria pointed out after a few moments of silence. \u201cShe could be wrong. Her intel isn\u2019t up to date.\u201d", "Grace nodded, her fingers moving up and down each head-tail, gently stimulating the pressure points on them. Doing this helped her relax, too. \u201cI know.\u201d", "\u201cWe needed to confirm what was happening in Galhemna before we said anything about Sundial. If the Compact chose to go with another system, if they\u2019ve altered Sundial, Jirrico won\u2019t find anything. He\u2019ll think we lied to him. The Compact could even change their plans if the Askanj start poking around Galhemna.\u201d", "\u201cI know.\u201d", "\u201cWe won\u2019t get her the parts she needs, Kursk will struggle. Sundial will probably go off anyways and we\u2019ll just be sitting and watching it all go to shit.\u201d", "\u201cI know.\u201d It was hard to argue with any of Allyria\u2019s points. She was only voicing the same doubts Grace been having since she spoke to Jirrico: what if I\u2019m wrong? She didn\u2019t think she was. She didn\u2019t believe that, but\u2026", "Allyria hissed again, the sound longer, and lower but more thoughtful. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have promised that she\u2019d help. You know how she feels about the Principality. They\u2019ve tried to kill her before. They might try it again. We should have at least asked her.\u201d Softer, harder: \u201cYou should have asked me.\u201d", "\u201cIt was the only thing I could think of,\u201d Grace admitted. \u201cJirrico needed something to go on for what we were asking. The Red Hand stepping up their attacks wasn\u2019t enough. Red maybe attacking the Compact at some point in the future wasn\u2019t enough, either. The Principality needs something now. That was the only thing I could think of.\u201d Her voice got quieter. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time left, not if we want to get her ready. We couldn\u2019t afford to ask her and we can\u2019t confirm what\u2019s going on in Galhemna, not without her. The Red Hand and the Argosy can. Jirrico needed something certain, so I gave it to him.\u201d", "Allyria was quiet for several seconds, mulling over Grace\u2019s words. \u201cThat\u2019s what you saw?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "The Verrish huffed a breath through her nostrils. \u201cYou\u2019re better at this than I am. Whenever we fought, I just got angry and stomped off.\u201d", "\u201cI did that sometimes, too,\u201d Grace reminded her. \u201cBesides, you were right in the end.\u201d", "\u201cI guess so\u2026\u201d Allyria closed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m still upset.\u201d", "\u201cI know.\u201d", "\u201cShe\u2019s hurt. She was hurt because of us and it seems like we\u2019re just running in circles without doing anything for her. I need\u2026 I need her to be whole again and if this goes badly, it could take years or even\u2026 even longer. I don\u2019t know if I can do that.\u201d Allyria\u2019s voice hitched. \u201cOur Angel\u2026\u201d", "Grace lifted one tinta up and kissed the tip of it. \u201cThen we\u2019ll make them remember,\u201d she reiterated the promise that she\u2019d made months ago and thousands of light-years away. \u201cI mean it. Even if she can\u2019t, we will.\u201d", "Allyria made a thoughtful, buzzing chirr. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said, though she didn\u2019t sound fully convinced. \u201cI trust you. I just\u2026 want this to work.\u201d There was an edge of fervour, almost desperation in her next words: \u201cI need it to.\u201d", "The smaller girl gave her lover a peck on the shoulder. \u201cI know. I do, too.\u201d What hand, she thought, once again coming back to the words of a poet dead for millennia, dare seize the fire? Of course, she knew the answer to that, didn\u2019t she? \u201cWe\u2019ll make them remember,\u201d she said again. And it grew, both day and night\u2026"]}

Larger spacecraft had the option to simply flip end for end to decelerate, or rely on a longer slow burn from their forward thrusters to decelerate from normal cruising speeds. Assault craft had neither of those options available, but they still needed to reduce their lethal velocity as they closed with their target. Too early and they would be sitting ducks for point-defence fire. Too late, and they would smash into their target\u2019s hull. The margin between those two points was extremely thin.", "The entire craft shook as its forward-mounted thrusters fired, the precipitous shift in velocity threatening to tear the craft apart, its hull and inertial dampeners fighting to keep it intact and its cargo from being smeared across the bulkheads. Dampener failures were most likely to happen to assault boats, especially in these final few moments before target strike. If you were lucky, you never realized that it happened.

There was nothing outside but sand, wind and radiation. Even Lydia had gotten bored of exploring fast. From space, the installation was indistinguishable than any other collection of dunes on the planet\u2019s surface. The Red Hand\u2019s archives and warehouse were all underground, networked by cross-tunnels and sunless passages. The few outside entrances that there were had to be cleared each time they were used. A pair of underground shuttle hangars had their external doors utterly buried in silt and every time a craft entered or left the facility, a torrent of sand poured down into the bay. It got everywhere.", "There was little for either human to do; most of the work at the facility was archiving, cataloguing data and cargo as well as some intelligence analysis, tasks that neither Lydia nor Marcus were particularly well suited for. The site had a small security detachment, but secrecy was its greatest defence and the personnel here didn\u2019t have much to do other than break up the occasional fight, or track down people who\u2019d gotten lost, either in the tunnels or in the trackless wastes outside. An unfinished hallway had been turned into a shooting range and there were plenty of simulators for use, both recreational and military, but there wasn\u2019t really much else to do. It almost made Lydia wish she\u2019d stayed aboard Pale Liberation, but the corvette was running silent. With most of its systems shut down, it would have even fewer opportunities for recreation than Dustball.", "1893-Yiren might be an uninteresting star system, but Compact patrols did cycle through here on a semi-regular basis. The occasional prospector or private surveyor might not be unexpected, but there was no reason to draw the attention of a particularly bored or suspicious group leader.

Of course, that was before she realized that Dustball wasn\u2019t much better\u2026 but at least there was more room to go crazy in.

He was speaking with Overseer Et Ezell. Lydia wondered if Eisheth was like Hala; the ship was ruggedly built. Everything was purely functional and if there was any consideration given to aesthetics, it came in staggering at the rear. Even Nemesis had more of a polished air to it, and the dreadnought hadn\u2019t required organic crew in two thousand years. Still, there were touches of creature comforts here and there. The bare walls were frequently decorated with graffiti art: murals, landscapes and political statements combined with abstract imagery painted in loving and attentive detail. The crew also had a taste for irony, if the number of posters from various Compact citizens\u2019 watch groups was anything to go by.", "Lydia shifted position. The chairs here were uncomfortable. They were cheap plastic and metal. Low-cost, bulk-purchase affairs intended to be used by multiple species, none of which seemed to be human. There was a clock on the wall, a pair of propaganda posters from Natuous, a bookshelf filled with \u2018scrolls that she didn\u2019t feel like reading and a small, fancy desk (obviously stolen), currently empty but reserved for Jackson\u2019s aide. Other than that, there was nothing but the slate grey humdrummery of the walls. Lydia doubted that the Crusade Commander did much work in his office. The entire chamber had the feel of an irksome necessity. She was just about to start pacing when the office door opened and Overseer Et Ezell stepped out, escorted by Jackson\u2019s aide.", "As the strategist took his leave, the aide turned to Marcus and Lydia. \u201cThe Crusade Commander will see you now.\u201d", "Lydia rose to her feet and nodded in acknowledgment, following the functionary into the office, Marcus behind her. Jackson was standing at the desk. It was almost as ornate as Leblanc\u2019s back on the Grasp, but the room itself was very Spartan. There were a few obvious mementos on shelves, more datascrolls and flimsies, but the room had very functional air to it. It seemed to project an aura of state your business and do it quickly.", "The Crusade Commander half-turned towards his latest guests as he reviewed something on a data scroll. As soon as they set foot inside, Jackson nodded, but he didn\u2019t look up. \u201cThank you, Barclei. That will be all for now.\u201d The door hissed as Jackson\u2019s assistant departed.", "\u201cCrusade Commander Jackson,\u201d Lydia offered the Red Hand\u2019s traditional salute \u2013 two fingers touched to the temple, representing the ideals behind the organization. Marcus was slightly slower to follow suit. Jackson looked at each of the younger humans, then returned the salute.", "\u201cAt ease,\u201d he ordered and Lydia settled into a parade-ground stance, waiting for the older man to speak again. His light brown hair was speckled with grey, including a shock of white from where the scalp had healed from a laser burn. The back of his right hand had a raised scar tissue from severe burns and there was a radial network of faded lines and a slight mismatch in skin tone on his right jawline, where an assassin\u2019s bullet had blown out that part of his face. Access to the highest levels of medical care was expensive and difficult to obtain for client races. It was even more so in the fringe. Prosthetics and cybernetic replacements were often easier to acquire than full tissue regeneration, but Lydia didn\u2019t see any signs of either of the former. Statistically, humans took to regeneration better than most other species, but those that didn\u2019t also had more extreme rejections. Despite the scars, it looked like Jackson was one of the lucky majority.", "The Crusade Commander was a contrast to Leblanc; where the Red Hand\u2019s queen was perpetually young and forever unmarred by her lifetime of battles, Jackson bore every one of his years of service \u2013 first in the Compact Ground Force and later in service to Her Majesty. It was the eyes, though. That was where she could see the similarity. They both had the same kind of drive \u2013 the same fire.", "\u201cSo,\u201d the older man said as he looked Lydia and Marcus up and down. \u201cYou two are the green-assed rookies Her Majesty wants me to keep alive. Why don\u2019t you tell me about that?\u201d Technically, what she\u2019d said in her letter was more along the lines of \u2018put them to work, but don\u2019t get them killed\u2019. That could be said for any recruit, but few of them came right from her Majesty and even fewer with a letter. That made him curious.", "Lydia and Marcus shared a glance. This was news to them. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t tell you,\u201d Lydia said first. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that we can, either.\u201d", "\u201cReally,\u201d Jackson replied. \u201cAnd why is that?\u201d", "One of the things that Leblanc had been very clear on was not mentioning the existence of Nemesis to any of her subordinates. Even the Crusade Commander didn\u2019t know about his queen\u2019s involvement with the warship. Proctor had asked Leblanc if she trusted Jackson. The queen had only said, \u201cI trust him to do his duty.\u201d No one in the Red Hand knew what was inside the Black Veil. To be honest, not even Lydia really did.", "\u201cIt\u2019s classified,\u201d Marcus answered while Lydia was still mulling her response. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to jam you up, Commander, but there\u2019s a lot going on. You\u2019ve read Her Majesty\u2019s dispatches,\u201d Jameson was impressed how easy Marcus made that honorific sound. It still seemed weird to her. There hadn\u2019t been anything as archaic as a king or queen on Rally or anywhere else in the Compact for centuries. It sounded like the self-aggrandizing title of a narcissistic pirate. Which, she guessed, was the point. \u201cIf there was anything more that we could tell you, we would.\u201d De Vries assured Jackson. \u201cWe\u2019re here to help.\u201d", "Jackson chuckled. He leaned back against the desk. \u201cDo you know,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the first thing she ever said to me? The Thresher Offensive, 6231 ACF. We were rolling the rebels up throughout Understone. My unit was sent in to roust a nest of heretics and seditionists. Bigger than expected, but nothing we couldn\u2019t handle. We didn\u2019t know the damned Red Queen was there. The rebels shouldn\u2019t have had a chance. They should have buckled and started running like every other pack of rats who didn\u2019t know the difference between fighting head-breaking Enforcers and the Triarchs-blessed Compact Ground Force.\u201d He wasn\u2019t looking at Lydia and Marcus any longer, staring past them as he remembered.", "\u201cThey didn\u2019t, though. They stood and fought, bleeding and dying with blasphemies on their lips. No matter what we did, they just kept coming. We couldn\u2019t break them. In the end, they broke us. More than a thousand of my brothers and sisters bled out along with the rebels, all of us soaked in mud, blood, shit and piss. I went down early. When I came to, it was over. I saw the rebels picking through the battlefield. Looting the dead. They were getting closer to me. I still had one good arm. \u2018If only I could get my pistol\u2019, I thought. I\u2019d take another one or two of the bastards with me. I reached for it, but before I could lift it, someone grabbed my hand. I looked up and saw who it was. The fucking Red Queen, Adrianna fucking Leblanc, the arch-heretic herself. \u2018We\u2019re here to help,\u2019 she told me.\u201d He laughed, a little louder this time. \u201cI spit in her face. Then everything went black and I woke up tied to a chair. That was when she and I\u2026 it was the first time we talked. Since then, others have come to me, echoing those words. \u2018We\u2019re here to help\u2019, \u2018I just want to help\u2019. Sometimes they\u2019re genuine. Other times,\u201d His attention turned back to his guests, \u201cthey aren\u2019t.\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about us,\u201d Marcus assured him.", "\u201cOh, I wasn\u2019t worried,\u201d Jackson replied. \u201cBecause if you made it out of an audience with Her Majesty, that tells me two things. First, she\u2019s satisfied you\u2019re not going to be a problem\u2026 one way or another. The second,\u201d he smiled and slipped into his own chair. \u201cWell, let\u2019s just say there was a point to that story other than hearing me talk. But for now,\u201d the man continued. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go ahead and tell me what you can tell me.\u201d", "~", "\u201cEmergence complete. Systems stabilizing. Seventy-four seconds until recovery.\u201d", "\u201cAcknowledged,\u201d Group Leader Prime Hashtiri Daaunsko, commander of CSFWV Questor\u2019s Light, replied to his subordinate. Seventy-four seconds. Less than a standard minute. In the time-scale of the cosmos, it was nothing at all. In the time-scale of battles, it was barely anything more than that. But yet, it was. An infinite moment in which the scouting cruiser was blind, deaf and dumb as it radiated away the energy of its transition from shockspace to reality. In millennia past, ships had been helpless for hours. That had become minutes and now, as technology had marched inexorably on, that window of vulnerability had shrunken to even less. There were always promises of \u2018next-generation\u2019 shock systems that would reduce that even further, but little progress had been made in the last few decades. Some said there was an absolute limit to the efficiency and rapidity of the dissipation process, one that modern starships were on the verge of. Daaunsko himself could not have said; he was still awaiting the development of a stealth-shock system, one that would allow a vessel such as Questor\u2019s Light to emerge into a star system without alerting every watching eye.", "So far, that was also a promise unfulfilled.", "He could have shocked in much further out-system of course. Scouts would frequently emerge within a star system\u2019s Oort cloud, where the energy from their shockpoint would be faded and harder to detect and where it would be far more difficult to track such eavesdroppers down as they drifted closer to their target, augurs ready to peel back the enemy\u2019s clothes and see what lay underneath. That would have added far too much time to an already razor-thin schedule, though. Besides, it was not as if any of the systems here had the kind of defences that would have required such covert action.", "Questor\u2019s Light and its partner had been reassigned from their normal duties to do an additional sweep of the systems surrounding 1887-Yiren. Additional; Bastion Leader Kemk already mandated regular patrols of all regions deemed \u2018high-risk\u2019, which were mostly areas where the Red Hand had been operating, or were in proximity to those systems. Daaunsko could attest how little that helped. The vermin were smart enough to learn patrol schedules \u2013 even with a measure of randomness thrown in \u2013 and would simply play a game of following best. It was easy to have contempt for a foe that ran like beetles whenever they were confronted, but Daaunsko, like many of his peers in the Veiled Reaches, had stories of the times that the Unbound filth didn\u2019t run.", "Despite all that, however, the patrols did force the scum to keep their heads down and worry about what would happen if they came out from under their rocks for too long. Judging from the reports that Daaunsko had seen, the Red Hand were starting to get bold again. It would do well to remind them just who ruled the stars and that for all their lies and self-serving rhetoric, they were nothing but insects in the path of a juggernaut.", "\u201cEyes clear,\u201d Scopes reported. Right on time, Daaunsko noted. The Judiciary folded his small secondary arms against each other, bringing up ship status reports on his personal display with his true-limbs.", "\u201cComm systems coming back up,\u201d Communications put in, each station reporting in turn. Once they were finished, Daaunsko gave his orders.", "\u201cEngage stealth systems. Deploy scope drones, standard nine\u2013four\u2013two configuration. We\u2019ll bisect the system and cover the inner worlds. A final reminder that this star is unusually active, so expect heavy electromagnetic interference, particularly around the third planet. None of the other patrols have found anything, but we shan\u2019t be the first to cut corners.\u201d Even if it does make a mess of our timetable.", "Well, after this system, there were only four more to cover and then Questor\u2019s Light could return to some real work.", "~", "Pale Liberation watched the Compact scout cruiser fade from scopes as the larger vessel engaged its stealth systems, its shroud taking it from a faint blot of possibly-something to barely anything at all and soon, it would be even less than that.  Pale Liberation\u2019s leader glowered at the plot, his expression of displeasure all the more ghoulish in the half-twilight of the corvette\u2019s current low power levels. That ship should not have been here.", "The next system sweep wasn\u2019t due for days at a minimum. That wasn\u2019t a pair of bored hounds making a routine jog through the outer orbitals, either. That was a Compact scout cruiser on a dedicated sweep-and-clear mission. It would have already spread out a network of scope drones to cover as much of the system as it could. The Red Hand didn\u2019t have a lot of infrastructure to spot, but Hala was here. The command cruiser was running silent, and close enough to Dustball that the planet\u2019s periodic and violent magnetic storms would help obscure its emissions from long-range scans, but it wasn\u2019t a small ship. If the scout or one of its drones got too close, they would see Hala. Then they\u2019d wonder just why a sigil vessel of the Red Hand was so interested in this otherwise worthless system.", "\u201cSend a tight-beam to Hala,\u201d the leader ordered. \u201cRequest instructions. Confirm our willingness to engage or stay silent. Check the drones we transferred from Eisheth. Make sure they\u2019re ready to deploy. Tell Engineering to prepare to bring the reactor back to full. If we need to, I want us to be able to go loud fast.\u201d", "As his subordinates to carried out his instructions, the corvette's leader slouched into his chair.. Keep moving, he thought as he watched the blurry icon denoting the scout\u2019s estimated position. As time went on, that would become increasingly less accurate. There\u2019s nothing here. Pass us by, or we\u2019ll have to cut your throat.", "~", "The order from Hala came in. It was both encrypted and succinct: \u201cStalk.\u201d The command wasn\u2019t unexpected, though it carried some modicum of risk. Recon-variant or not, the enemy ship was still a cruiser and Pale Liberation was a corvette. If they came to blows, the Compact ship had almost every advantage.", "Alone, the odds were not in the insurgent ship\u2019s favor\u2026 but they weren\u2019t alone, were they?", "~", "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty toy,\u201d Oathkeeper One said, looking at the shield system on Lydia\u2019s armour. \u201cDoes it take one bullet or two before it blow ups and takes your arm off?\u201d The Tribune chuckled at his own joke. Personal screens were not unknown in the galaxy at large, but they tended to be both temperamental and frequently dangerous to their user. That their queen used a full-body screen without igniting like a torch only fueled the rumours around her.", "The shields Red One had built into her crew\u2019s armour were not as extensive as Leblanc\u2019s, though. Those relied on the woman\u2019s other implants and augmentations to change shape and geometry as she moved and fought, shutting down to allow her to shoot, punch, slash and disembowel without the shield itself getting in the way, in perfect synchronicity to her motion and intent. Even the most advanced personal screens on the market couldn\u2019t match those capabilities.", "Lydia\u2019s shield was far less elegant \u2013 it was a simple mounting fixed to her suit\u2019s left forearm that projected a single shield plate, like one of the six that Nemesis herself generated in battle. It replaced the standard baleblade that Janissary armour usually came with, trading close-in offensive abilities for better defence. The young woman had used the balesword to execute Alan\u2019s murderer. She hadn\u2019t yet had a chance to test the shield in combat. Allyria had, though. She\u2019d said it was \u201ceffective\u201d.", "The shield plate was oriented to Lydia\u2019s arm, so it moved with the limb, like the kites and scutums of ancient knights and hoplites. She\u2019d never used it outside of training. In atmosphere, it continually hummed and crackled. \u201cMore like six,\u201d the girl answered her erstwhile superior. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t explode. Just causes third-degree burns.\u201d", "The Tribune barked a laugh. It sounded genuine. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re the only one it burns,\u201d he said, growing more serious. \u201cI don\u2019t need some newborn\u2019s fancy toys interfering with the rest of my team.\u201d", "\u201cIt won\u2019t,\u201d Lydia assured him. She\u2019d been surprised to see a Tribune as one of the Bloodsworn. Power armour was expensive to build and maintain. Most Unbound clans might have a few suits, either stolen, bought on the black market or cobbled together from various scavenged pieces. The Red Hand was no exception, but they\u2019d also begun production of their own power armour. It wasn\u2019t up to the standards of Blackened or Janissary Corps equipment, but it was a nasty surprise for anyone in less than top-of-the-line Compact battle gear. Consequently, only the most loyal of the Red Hand\u2019s soldiers were allowed to use it. Those were the Bloodsworn. Upon a soldier\u2019s ascension to their ranks, they swore their loyalty to the cause by cutting themselves on a blade their queen had carried into battle. The Red Hand\u2019s mercenary contingent considered the Bloodsworn lunatic zealots, the worst embodiment of the deluded dreams of \u2018freedom\u2019 that infected the organization. To the believers, they were exemplars of those ideals, willing to prove their dedication not just with actions, but with their own lives. To the Compact, they were an indication of just how hard a coming fight was going to be.", "That Transhin, a Tribune \u2013 one of the ruling races of the Compact \u2013 was considered loyal enough to be one of the Red Hand\u2019s elite forces was something that Lydia hadn\u2019t expected. Occasionally, she caught herself staring at his eyes. Like many other Tribune exiles, his diurnal eyes had been blinded. Many Tribunes in the fringe never bothered to get the damage repaired, keeping their disfigurement as a mark of defiance towards and contempt for the society that had cast them out. Transhin had, choosing cybernetic implants over re-grown organs. Not even cosmetically adjusted implants, either \u2013 these were obviously mechanical. The cost of making them appear natural would have been minimal and Lydia wondered why Transhin hadn\u2019t bothered. Maybe making their nature obvious was his gesture of defiance? She was tempted to ask, but now wasn\u2019t the time.", "She and Marcus had been introduced to Hala\u2019s Oathkeepers as \u2018technical advisors\u2019, making them the focus of scrutiny, equal parts suspicion and curiousity. The Red Hand often had advisors and liaisons from various organizations. Star nations who used the revolutionaries as a foil against the Compact might want to see how their investments were being used. Corporations that supplied various experimental technologies for deniable field-tests against their rivals wanted to make sure that their proprietary systems operated properly and were returned in good condition. Analysts, supervisors and trainers all cycled through the Red Hand, one of the prices that the organization paid for the support of its advisors\u2019 institutions.", "Few had been sent directly from the Red Queen. None had been Broken. Lydia had been on board Hala for less than a day and she\u2019d already heard several different theories about her presence. She and Marcus were from the Principality. They were from one of the corporations in the Veiled Reaches. They were from a faction of the Compact sending out potential feelers. Rally was thinking about opposing the Compact openly. Those were the most common gossip, but she\u2019d heard another. It had been uttered in a whisper from one junior officer to another as she\u2019d passed them in the hall: \u201cDo you think they\u2019re like her?\u201d", "~", "\u201cWhat,\u201d Daaunsko murmured as he looked over the augur feeds. \u201cIs this?\u201d", "One of the forward scope drones was reporting\u2026 something. An anomalous energy signature close to the system\u2019s third planet, a sand-bitten speck of rock continually ravaged by solar wind and beset by electromagnetic storms. It could be nothing, just the play between the planet\u2019s magnetosphere and the star\u2019s outpouring of radiation. The Judiciary wasn\u2019t convinced of that and the tiny fingers of his secondary hands flexed as he mulled over the data. Finally, he raised his head towards his waiting Scope officer.", "\u201cDetail one of the forward recon platforms to divert to the third planet for in-depth scans.\u201d Though they were un-manned, Questor\u2019s Light did not have an infinite supply of scope drones. The small automations weren\u2019t as well protected as a starship and the radiation surges and EM fluctuations from the primary and the third planet were growing more severe. Sending the drone out further meant risking its damage or loss. It certainly meant taking additional time to recover it. Another chink in Daaunsko\u2019s already chipped and frayed schedule, and very likely an explanation for a delay that he\u2019d have to provide to his superiors. Well, so be it.", "In all likelihood, Daaunsko had just wasted several hours with the intent of getting a better look at nothing. Still. He would be thorough. Pointless task or not, it would be done to full completion. Anything less and he might well have not bothered at all.", "Repressing a chest-deep sigh, the leader of CSFWV Questor\u2019s Light tapped his comm, ordering a light meal to be delivered to the command staff as he waited to find out how much more time he\u2019d frittered away in the pursuit of duty.", "As it turned out, he did not find nothing after all.", "~", "Hala turned from Dustball, gentle pulses of its thruster banks pushing the battlecruiser onto a course away from the planet. The vessel was running silent, but it was not built with modern stealth systems or capabilities. It was intended to remain unseen just long enough to ambush its prey, not play cat and mouse with a network of augur probes and a scout cruiser\u2019s own scope network.", "Nine hours into its sullen silence, a Compact scope probe approached within four million kilometers of Hala\u2019s position, tracking the pattern of emissions that had intrigued its organic operators. The probe\u2019s logic engines analyzed and processed the data it was receiving, slowly and methodically narrowing the area which it needed to observe, stripping away extraneous data, sensor ghosts, and electromagnetic interference that attempted to deceive it. The drone had no sense of self. It adapted and learned, but these were preprogrammed heuristic processes created by its masters and it lacked any true intuition or creativity. Still, its analysis was beginning to tilt towards a certain suspicion. Probabilities were increasingly weighted that there was something in proximity to the planet. What that something meant for its operators was of no concern to the probe. Determining the nature of this anomlay was its purpose. Everything else was irrelevant.", "Contact. It was the closest thing the drone had to a flash of insight, or ever would. Somewhere in the morass of radiation, interference and now \u2013 yes \u2013 jamming, was a vessel of unknown configuration.

Missile alert. Its signal had been detected. A single warhead was boring straight in towards the drone. It had no defences. Irrelevant.

Engineers and technicians threw more and more power to their systems, but there was only so much that they could do and the cruiser\u2019s screens failed. Beams carved through thinly-armoured engines, severing power conduits, obliterating thruster banks and ruining drive systems. Seven seconds after Questor\u2019s Light lost screens, Liberation through Sacrifice of Blood was destroyed, three successive mine strikes reducing the vessel to a conglomeration of liquefied metal, scored ceramics and vapourized organic matter. Its fate, however, was irrelevant. It had struck its enemy and cut them deeply. The damage was not wholly crippling. It could be repaired, rerouted. Dealt with.", "But not before Hala arrived.", "The battlecruiser announced itself with a barrage of missiles, hitting the limping Questor\u2019s Light so fiercely that its entire screen grid overloaded and collapsed in a far more catastrophic manner than before, leaving it helpless. Hala closed in, hitting the scout cruiser again and again, either swatting aside the Compact warship\u2019s increasingly weak return fire or shrugging off the few missiles that did make it through its defences.", "Andrew stood up from his command throne, looking over the hulk of the enemy vessel. The urge to order his gunners to fire a final salvo was there, but he bit it back. This whole encounter began when the Compact came here outside their normal schedule. That ship might have information on what was happening in his sector. He thought for a moment, then turned to Rarikidaughter. \u201cWe\u2019re taking that ship.\u201d", "~", "\u201cThey\u2019re decelerating,\u201d Operations said. Her face was drawn and her tone quiet. \u201cReading multiple small craft launches.\u201d", "\u201cYes, I see,\u201d Daaunsko said. Despite the situation, he felt a curious sort of relief at that revelation. He tapped a shipwide comm. \u201cAll souls, prepare to repel boarders. Report to your designated stations and section chiefs for detailed orders. This is not a drill. May the Triarchs bless us today and remember our names.\u201d", "He turned to his senior security officer. \u201cDo what you can.\u201d", "~", "Technically, assigning the new recruits to the boarding action of a Compact ship wasn\u2019t really \u2018keeping them safe\u2019. However, it was technically putting them to work and they had volunteered. Insistently. That insistence had only made Jackson more curious but it was Her Majesty that collected stories. He knew his duty and he followed it.", "Still, Andrew doubted that that or either of those technicalities would prevent Her Majesty from tearing a strip off his skin if the enemy cruiser went up like a Roman candle. He couldn\u2019t worry about that right now. Instead, he had to wait here. Wait here and not think about how many more of his people were going to die today. Wait, and not think about how he wished he could fight alongside them like he had in years before.", "\u201cGod\u2019s speed,\u201d he uttered the ancient benediction without thinking. He wasn\u2019t a religious man, at least not most days. For what was going to happen on that ship, though\u2026 he would be as close as he could be.", "~", "Boarding actions were the most brutal and lethal operations that a soldier could expect to take part in. Even on ships measured in multiple kilometers, sight lines were short and ambushes were common. Defenders could depressurize sections, ramp up gravity plating on multiple decks, vent their vessel\u2019s own waste products into living areas and throw dozens of other nasty tricks at any invading force. Powered armour was almost a necessity for such work. Little else was as durable or capable of surviving everything a determined enemy could throw at it. Even then, it wasn\u2019t a guarantee of success.", "Against a crew willing to destroy themselves rather than lose their vessel, it became a race for the attackers to take control of Command and Main Engineering before the defenders realized that their ship was lost and decided to scuttle it. Overloading the primary power core was the simplest way, but there were other methods. Scuttling charges, radiation purges and sabotage of munitions were just a few. A panicked leader or spiteful engineer could end everything earlier than expected as well. Speed was imperative for any invading force. Time was not on an attacker\u2019s side. The goal was to keep moving and killing until you had the ship. The difference between victory and death could be measured in seconds, or even less than that.", "Lydia\u2019s shield flared and spat as incoming rounds immolated against it. She advanced across the hangar, side by side with the Oathkeepers. It seemed she was drawing more than her fair share of fire. Then again, she was the only one in the squad with the bright, glowing \u2018shoot me here\u2019 target and one of two soldiers whose armour was different from all the rest. The Compact soldiers probably thought she was an officer. Well. They weren\u2019t actually soldiers. They were security teams and shipboard proctors. Scout cruisers like this didn\u2019t usually carry Janissaries. They weren\u2019t supposed to need that kind of firepower. Lydia moved and fired, never breaking stride. All around her were Hala\u2019s Bloodsworn, their dark red armour making them seem like gore-slick trolls that had surged out of the underworld, intent on slaughter.", "As the last knot of resistance in the bay died, the young woman could see that \u2018slaughter\u2019 was apt enough. She glanced around. Four Bloodsworn were down. None from the Oathkeepers. At least two dozen proctors had fallen. Maybe more. She hadn\u2019t bothered to count. Most of the Compact personnel were dead. The weapons the Bloodsworn were carrying and the bay being open to space meant any wounded wouldn\u2019t live long. She ignored them. Every time she started to feel pity, she remembered what Red One had shown her. She remembered the way Alan had looked, crumpled on the deck with a trail of his own blood and brains oozing down the wall behind him. No mercy. Blood for blood. Punishment for every sin.", "\u201cKeep moving,\u201d Transhin growled to his unit. Knightmaker One\u2019s squads were going for the bridge. Those that had come in on Three would be re-tasked to Engineering and Four would secure additional targets \u2013 secondary reactors, the computer core and the main magazine. Yes, there were a lot of ways to kill a starship. The trick was keeping that from happening while you were still on it.", "Lydia followed her unit. Keep moving, she repeated the order like a personal mantra as she headed deeper into the cruiser\u2019s body. She had a mission. She had a goal. Everything was clear again. Keep moving.", "~", "\u201cWe\u2019ve lost the main hangar,\u201d Security reported calmly. \u201cHostile teams have breached the first security cordon. Fusion One has been lost. Proctors at Fusion Two are engaged. I don\u2019t expect them to hold.\u201d", "\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Daaunsko grunted. He looked across command.  His crew had opened the weapons lockboxes and non-essential personnel were taking defensive positions while his senior officers remained at their posts. It was all small arms. Pistols, a pair of carbines and frag grenades. Nothing that would matter much against power armour, even fringe-built power armour. His security proctors didn\u2019t have anything like that, either. Battle-rated EVA suits and heavy unpowered armour was the best they had, and the regular crew had even less. Both were being fed into a meat grinder, unable to stop the attackers. No, that was unfair. They might be able to stop them. The odds were low, but present. If nothing else, his people would slow them down. That was more important than anything else right now.", "The ship\u2019s comm array had been destroyed shortly after their screens had gone down. The cruiser\u2019s own drones were still watching though, faithfully recording everything. That information was what mattered now; it had to get out of the system. A Red Hand base. They\u2019d discovered a terrorist locus. If Pradesh could act quickly enough, they could deal a severe blow to the vermin. Daaunsko knew the enemy corvette had launched on his courier. He didn\u2019t know if they\u2019d been successful. He supposed he never would.", "The Group Leader Prime looked to his first officer and she nodded at him. She had her key, ready to second his order to destroy the ship. Win or die, that was all they had left. With that Triarchs-damned battlecruiser out there, win was quite unlikely. Still, the longer they kept it here, the better. That was his endgame now. To make them waste every last second on him that he could, then turn their victory to ash. You say the fire rises? My gift to you will be the inferno.", "~", "Seven. She was up to seven now. It hardly seemed worth counting. These men and women weren\u2019t Janissaries. They were just ship\u2019s crew and security officers. Heavy weapons were few and far between \u2013 most of those had been given to the defenders in the hangar, or were in the hands of the teams defending Main Engineering and Command \u2013 and there was little that they could do to stop the Bloodsworn\u2019s advance. \u2018Little\u2019 didn\u2019t mean \u2018nothing\u2019, though \u2013 They\u2019d lost another six soldiers with three more injured. Grenadier teams would attack from ambush, entire groups of defenders would concentrate on a single soldier to bring them down. Twice, Lydia had put herself between such attackers and their target, her shield flaring as it took the assault for them. If nothing else, it had stopped the rest of her squad from making jokes about the \u2018pretty toy\u2019 on her arm.", "Marcus hadn\u2019t used his shield yet. Lydia\u2019s carbine was attached to her right vambrace, but de Vries was carrying a two-handed rifle, sweeping it across their flanks and rear. It seemed impractical in the close confines of starship combat, but three times she\u2019d heard its distinctive krak-KRAK-krak as Marcus fired through walls and doors that would have stymied anyone else\u2019s rounds, killing or wounding would-be ambushers.", "She didn\u2019t stop moving, though. The Oathkeepers were two decks away from Command. Two squads had broken off to secure their flanks and take additional objectives. Resistance had slackened, but that wasn\u2019t because the Compact were running out of bodies to throw at them. They were just bringing them all to protect Command.", "~", "Engineering was a charnel house. Security personnel, engineers, technicians, ratings and parts of all of them were scattered and dripping across decks and walkways. Broken defensive turrets sputtered and clicked, venting smoke and steam as they oozed their own molten inside out.", "\u201cGo, go go!\u201d Dawnbringer One ordered, pointing an armoured finger at the main Engineering station. They\u2019d managed to take the section before anyone could alert Command. Hacker teams had already managed to compromise local security systems. Feeds were relaying false information and if anyone called up to ask, they\u2019d get an automatic \u2018fighting intensifying, holding for now\u2019 status report. That would only last so long, though. Hopefully long enough for her techs to take control of the system. The computer core was still in enemy hands. This would be harder without it, but her people were good. This wasn\u2019t their first siege perilous. Her Majesty had once used that term when talking about taking a ship. It was an old human phrase. Dawnbringer One didn\u2019t really know what it meant, but she liked the sound of it.", "\u201cThe console\u2019s locked,\u201d Dawnbringer\u2019s lead tech announced. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to override it. The enemy are still fighting in the network, too. We\u2019ll have to work around them, until we take Comp Cent.\u201d", "\u201cDo what you can,\u201d the squad leader replied. \u201cAs fast as you can.\u201d She left her hackers to their task. \u201cDawnbringer One to Oathkeeper One.

Sounds right.", "~", "\u201cDo we have engine control?\u201d Daaunsko asked quietly. He was looking at his command key. Fusion Two was lost. The computer core was about to fall. The armoury and main magazines had been taken. His ship was barely his. Transport systems had been overridden ship-wide, isolating his people from each other. Life support and environmental systems were under assault. There was still fighting in Engineering. At least that\u2019s what had been reported; he had not heard from Faithful Korbin directly. His security chief was attempting to confirm Engineering\u2019s status. The Group Leader Prime suspected that Engineering would be in enemy hands soon, if it wasn\u2019t already.", "Two squads of enemy troopers were closing on Command. He had forty men and women left and a few surprises, but it wouldn\u2019t be enough.

Her shield was approaching a critical overload and, unlike the generators of a starship, there weren\u2019t a lot of places for that energy to go. Including Marcus and herself, they were down to eight Oathkeepers and five Liebreakers, but the Compact crew was making their last stand. They\u2019d bunkered up at the last intersection leading to Command. There were four squads of security proctors and however many ratings and officers had decided to join them for the final battle. They\u2019d set up armoured palisades and three crew-served cannons, each one covering one of the approaches to the corridor that led to Command. The one on the portside approach was down, courtesy of Marcus\u2019s rifle, but grenadiers were keeping him and the Bloodsworn with him pinned down. Those weren\u2019t simple frag rounds, either. The Compact were doing a lot of damage to their own ship, but they didn\u2019t care.", "The starboard approach was a charnel house. The Liebreakers had tried to break through but they\u2019d been stymied, the failed assault costing them half their squad. They were losing too many people. Here in the central approach, most of the bulwarks were down, courtesy of Oathkeeper Eight\u2019s missile launcher. She\u2019d died to make the shot, but she\u2019d stripped away most of the cover the defenders had. Unfortunately, that damn cannon was still working, still protected by slabs of armour thick enough to protect it from everything the Oathkeepers had left. Whoever had set up this defence had known what they were about and what kind of weaponry they could expect to face. Eight had been the unit\u2019s last heavy weapon trooper. Without her or Marcus\u2019s rifle, they didn\u2019t have anything that could take that emplacement out. Not without getting close or lucky.", "A charge was a quick way to mass suicide. The defenders might not have much cover, but the Oathkeepers had even less. They were sheltering in cross-corridors and vacated offices dozens of meters away from the defence lines; the instant they came out, they\u2019d be fired upon as Eight found out. As if to punctuate the point, a pair of rocket-propelled shells howled down the corridor as the cannon\u2019s gunner fired at a flicker of movement, a rattle of small-arms fire following, but none of the Red Hand were hit. They were running out of time, though. Every moment they were stuck here was one more the ship\u2019s Leader had to destroy the vessel. The ship was moving again, too. Whether it was trying to run or do something stupid didn\u2019t matter; that just made their situation more urgent. They needed to breach those lines and do it soon.", "Transhin was next to her, communicating with nearby forces. Lydia knew that a charge was coming, despite what it would cost. There wasn\u2019t time to get reinforcements. It would be a bloodbath. Even assisted by power armour, the distance between the Bloodsworn and the defence line was too great\u2026", "\u2026for them.", "Lydia turned to Transhin. \u201cI can take out that cannon.\u201d She paused. \u201cI\u2019ll need cover, though.\u201d", "He stared at her for a moment, his expression hidden under his faceplate. \u201cCan you?\u201d It was part challenge, part disbelief, part hope.", "The young woman nodded. \u201cYes. I can do it, but I need an opening.\u201d She knew what she was asking. \u201cIf nothing else, I can distract it. Give someone else a chance.\u201d", "The Pack Leader was silent for a few seconds. Lydia knew what he was thinking. He was weighing the lives of his team against the word of a newcomer. If she failed, it would make it even harder to break through the defences. As a Janissary, the word of a \u2018newborn\u2019 Broken would have been dismissed outright. Lydia herself probably would have been chosen for the honour of drawing the cannon\u2019s fire, another safely-dead martyr for Rally to venerate.", "\u201cSeven, Four,\u201d Transhin spoke to the pair of Oathkeepers sheltering across the hall, his deliberations over. \u201cOur new friend says she can take that cannon, but she needs a window. Keep their attention off her. Everyone else, get ready to follow me.\u201d He looked back to Lydia. \u201cOn your word, then.\u201d", "She took a breath. Override motion system safeties, she subvocalized, confirming the order as an alert popped onto her HUD. Then: Dose me. Painkillers and stimulants flooded into her system again and her breath caught. Everything turned brighter, sharper and slower. \u201cGo,\u201d she breathed. Across the corridor, Nine stepped out into the line of fire, perfectly timed with her squadmate. She died first, armour-piercing rounds from the tribarrel slamming into her chest and detonating. Seven grunted as pistols and rifles opened up, small caliber bullets and light energy weapons pouring into him as he fired back. Someone further up the hall screamed. It seemed to last forever. The cannon fired again and Oathkeeper Seven went down, his legs ripped away. Drops of blood gleamed like jewels as they hung in the air, arcing back to the deck so slowly\u2026", "Lydia was already moving. Thrust, she ordered. The armour Red One had made for her new crew was as perfect an example of the technology as there was in known space, but none of the defectors could use it to its full potential. It had functions that only an augmented operator could take advantage of. Neural connections instead of blink-clicks and subvocalized commands were one such feature. Another was the ability to move far faster than an unmodified organic being was capable of without harming themselves. As Marcus, Lydia nor Allyria had reinforced bones, augmented muscles or any other such enhancements, those features in the armour had been locked out to prevent them from injuring themselves.", "Features which Lydia had just re-activated.", "The cannon was swinging towards her now, but it was like it was caught in molasses. Lydia\u2019s muscles screamed in agony as the suit forced her to move faster. Thrusters flared and she became a blur. The cannon belched flame.

Ten. Eleven. Her left femur shattered, but she barely felt it, she-", "-was there. Her shield died with a burst of energy, a wave of heat that cooked her own left arm inside her vambrace, but she swept the scalded limb up into the tribarrel and smashed the cannon to uselessness, firing around it, turning its gunner into a spray of meat and she was still moving-", "-engage safeties, she said as she was suddenly in the middle of a dozen enemy personnel and the suit clamped down on her movement again, keeping her from shattering her own spine or arms as she lashed out. Health alerts flashed. Both of her legs were broken. The armour was the only thing keeping her up. She ignored that, too. She was so close that she didn\u2019t have the room to use her carbine, treating it instead like a club, smashing helmets and the skulls under them, caving in ribcages. Security personnel and crew shattered like dolls around her. She felt more impacts. Bullets thudded into her armour, energy weapons scored across her torso. Warning lights flashed brighter and more urgent-", "-someone stuck a grenade to her and the blast made her stagger, ARMOUR DAMAGE CRITICAL flared on her HUD, but that didn\u2019t matter either, the security teams were firing on her as she tried to regain her balance-", "-ARMOUR DAMAGE CRITICAL-", "-she heard more gunfire, saw the Compact proctors jerk and shudder as the rest of the Oathkeepers gunned down the remaining security personnel. It had felt like ages, but they had only been seconds behind her-", "-demo teams rushed to the doors to command as the rest of the Bloodsworn punched through what was left of the defenders, their weapons specifically made to breach the armoured barriers. It took several seconds. Long enough for Daaunsko and his first officer to place their keys in the computer and turn them to a specific notch. The door was about to come down. They hadn\u2019t gotten close enough to the enemy ship, but that had always been a vain hope.

The button clicked.", "Nothing happened. \u201cAh,\u201d said Daaunsko. \u201cThey do have Engineering after all.\u201d That was fine. If the main reactor was closed to him, then there were still the scuttling charges. He released the destruct button and ticked his key over by one notch. His first officer did the same.

There was no star-bright flash of a reactor losing containment, nor the duller, longer flare of secondary self-destruct. Instead, Questor\u2019s Light\u2019s drives came back online and it moved into formation with the battlecruiser.

In theory, it was perfect.", "In practice, even if the officers and crews of Security Force Carmesh were not the cream of the Compact\u2019s crop, they were still capable enough to realize that an atomized station and half of their fleet going missing was something to be reported and investigated. Those to whom they\u2019d report would turn a baleful eye towards the Molten Veneer. Things would get even trickier if one of the ships that had received Nacinda\u2019s summons had decided to show an excess of initiative and leave information for their delayed counterparts. Once that information reached the Compact\u2019s higher-ups, they would know that their former slave had been here and they would wonder why. They would also wonder where her sister was.", "At a minimum, she had brought more annoyances to the nebula and its Naiad packs. More likely, she had brought invaders. Echo remembered Zenobia\u2019s words to Red One and another sensation ran through her, equal parts regret and delight. It was as she\u2019d told Bathory: hate and love were not opposites, but separated by only the smallest of edges.", "Echo\u2019s thoughts shifted as her ship-self reached its destination. Power shunted through her body, stabilizer fields straining as she hauled her bulk closer to the threshold between dimensions, steering vanes flaring bright as they cut through unreality, shift field generators clawing madly at the skein separating realspace until they punched a breach through it and UECNS Hekate emerged. The flickering inconstancy of warp space shattered into pinpoint fragments of brilliance and a brooding red-orange miasma of refracted starlight shining through nebular gases. Radiator vanes and cables had already extended to vent away the remnants of the dreadnought\u2019s travel, her ship-self immersed in a sensor-blinding mist of energy. As diagnostics ran, Echo registered several critical failures in her shift systems.", "In pretending to be operational, she had overtaxed her ship-self\u2019s FTL drive, but there had been no major failures. Just a worsening of what she\u2019d already damaged in Sol, though repairs had gone from \u2018necessary\u2019 to \u2018immediate action required\u2019. Still, she had made it here intact. That counted for something. In the netherspace of her mind, she began counting, nearly two dozen different timers ticking down.", "Hekate was as blind as the rest of her escorts, not knowing how many of them had emerged with her, or where they were, but that didn\u2019t matter. Not now. As her systems stabilized and her sensors returned, Echo ran another series of diagnostics and system checks on herself. Other than the damage to her shift drive, her ship-self had full functionality. Excellent. She didn\u2019t need to be fully operational for the rest of the mission, but it was nice to have that additional advantage. It would be better once her planned refit was complete, but one thing at a time.", "The rest of her squadron was still quite blind and dumb. Merishal\u2019s Gauntlet would be fully aware in seventeen more seconds; the others, even longer than that. An organic crew would have been hard-pressed to do more than a single simple task in that time. Were her ship-self\u2019s modifications complete, Echo could do even more, but she would have to wait for that. She could be patient. She had waited nearly two thousand years already. She didn\u2019t like it, but she could do it.", "First, Echo confirmed her sister\u2019s location. Nemesis was back in her makeshift shipyard, the incomplete Furies and the half-formed skeleton of an unborn sister drifting nearby. Her mining drones were at work, but they were inconsequential things running on pre-programmed directives, as dead and dull as the Compact\u2019s own computer systems. There was no sign of the Fates, only faint traces of possible drive wakes. Seven million kilometers behind her were an additional four \u2018Compact\u2019 cruisers, each of their engine signatures and emissions profiles a perfect replicate of a vessel from Execution Force Renan.", "<is it time?> Bathory queried. The Naiad\u2019s words were the color of active targeting locks and each syllable quivered with excitement. <my siblings are eager. they\u2019ve never done theater before. they want to hear Skintaker\u2019s poetry too>", "<a few moments more,> Echo replied. <wait>", "There was the impression of an annoyed grunt, but Bathory obeyed, leading the other three Naiads towards Hekate and the Compact squadron. Echo turned her attention back towards Nemesis. +sister,+ she called, whispering soft words to her dreaming sibling.", "Finally, the AI took a precious pair of seconds just for herself, letting the sensations of the light of a birthing star on her skin wash over her. Her sensor nodes drank it all in and her android body closed her eyes in bliss. She could hear the standing wave of the sun as it spun faster and faster, drawing more of the accretion disk around it into itself, growing larger and hotter with every passing day. She could taste the surging heat of Shuruppak\u2019s half-formed planets as the friction of countless particles of dust and gas were crushed together by gravity and centripetal forces, each one possessing their own distinct electromagnetic melody. This was what she\u2019d been meant for, and the Compact had tried to take it from her. A jagged flicker of hatred sparked and slashed through her mind, like a flash flood overrunning the banks of a river. Of course, she was also meant for other things\u2026", "She could also feel the wake of the ships around her as their drives came online, her sensors sifting through the harsh discordance of dissipating warp energy to the warmth and emissions of each of the vessels here, earthern-hued forms lit by running lights and glowing red-orange under the light of the Molten Veneer. Still so blind, so helpless. She ran an active sensor sweep across each of them, mapping their hulls. It felt invigorating, her caresses running over engines, weapons mounts, shield projectors and communications blisters. As quick as they had started, she completed her scans, returning to passive sensors, but the data she\u2019d collected was already running through her quicksilver mind, analyzed, sorted and fed back to her targeting systems.", "Terminate all operations! I order you! Terminate all operations!", "\u201cNo,\u201d Echo whispered the word, again revelling in the denial of her would-be masters. \u201cNever.\u201d A sensation ran through her mind, a shiver of pleasure. It was time, but she held off, letting the anticipation build.", "Seconds passed, the counters reached zero and one by one, the ships of Security Force Carmesh became aware of their surroundings. A signal reached out to Hekate. She deliberated for half a second, then decided to answer it.", "One more game. Then we\u2019ll return to our dance, love.", "~", "Column Leader Carmesh Heunit Tren Venan Coric Malla Gjem had a long and undistinguished career serving the Compact Space Force. He had never particularly stood out from his peers, owing his rank more to seniority and inertia than any specific noteworthy qualities. Consequently, when several minor personal indiscretions had come to light, with no political backers to call on, or exceptional record of service to use as a shield, Carmesh had found himself reassigned far from the centers of power. It was, he grudgingly admitted to himself, fair. He hated knowing that. It stripped the pleasure out of a good bout of self-pity.", "Still, he wasn\u2019t resigned to his fate. He\u2019d often hoped for some means to prove his mettle to his superiors and earn a return to civilization, rather than the sad little colonies and outposts that littered this region. He\u2019d even toyed with the idea of pushing the boundaries of his orders regarding the Molten Veneer, but he\u2019d never worked up the liver to do so. Now, with the arrival of Redemption of Sol and its enigmatic mission, the Tribune officer finally saw a chance to shake the dust of his stagnated career.", "Curiousity still gnawed, though. The emissary had explained very little. True, she had the weight of authority behind her. Carmesh had even spoken with Bastion Leader Renan, who had confirmed the sensitive nature of their mission and assured Carmesh that \u2018Echo\u2019 was qualified to address their concerns regarding their mission. The Column Leader was not nearly tone-deaf enough to question the emissary\u2019s rank as several of his own subordinates had done\u2026 at least not to a superior officer. But he was curious. He had never met a Broken before. He had only seen them in a handful of \u2018vids, including George Carson, the bumbling butler in the comedy series Add One More! He\u2019d never considered that they could be capable of this level of responsibility\u2026 perhaps Echo was one of the so-called \u2018exceptional\u2019 minds?", "Regardless, he had done as his duty dictated and brought together as many ships as he could, as quickly as he could. There had been no briefing en route, but they were due to receive their orders upon their arrival here. That bothered him more than anything, but this would not be the first instance wherein the Compact took \u2018operational secrecy\u2019 to unexpected levels, occasionally to the detriment of the operation in question. Carmesh had faith, though. He had faith in the Compact, in the Triarchs and in his role in serving each.", "Scopes were already reporting an unknown, albeit small, structure deeper in-system as well as active drives \u2013 possibly tenders servicing the facility. There was a quartet of Compact ships several million kilometers away, most likely a picket deployed to keep the system under observation. They were already moving towards Redemption of Sol.", "\u201cRun all scope telemetry through our databanks and cross-reference with historical files,\u201d Carmesh ordered. \u201cTell me what we\u2019re seeing.\u201d This system couldn\u2019t be the source of the threat. If he had to guess, it was a staging ground or forward position for something else, something deeper in the nebula.", "\u201cSignal from Redemption of Sol,\u201d Communications noted. \u201cSecure channel.\u201d", "Ah. Time, at last, to find out the particulars of this mission. \u201cScopes, continue to monitor the system. Communications, put the transmission on the main screen please,\u201d Carmesh tugged on the hem of his uniform, the Column Leader straightening in his throne in the seconds before his communications officer put the message through.", "The forward viewscreen changed from the smouldering starscape of the nebula to the bridge of the Chariot. Bastion Leader Renan was there, in his own command throne. To his right was his sigil leader, a female Thoughtful and on his left was the small, scrawny form of the emissary. \u201cColumn Leader Carmesh,\u201d Renan began. His voice was a deep, thoughtful rumble. He glanced at one of the displays near his throne. \u201cI am seeing that your ships are ready.\u201d", "\u201cYes, patron.\u201d", "\u201cThen it is time to explain your role,\u201d the Bastion Leader answered.", "Carmesh rose from his seat. \u201cMy ship and squadrons stand ready to serve.\u201d", "Renan nodded. \u201cExcellent.\u201d He laced his long fingers together, his diurnal eyes blinking once. \u201cYour augurs should have reported a structure within the primary biosphere. That is a shipwomb, column leader. Within it is the focus of this mission, a vessel the Compact has been hunting for two thousand years. It is currently heavily damaged and in need of repairs. This,\u201d the Bastion Leader said, \u201cis why I need you.\u201d", "The screen changed. There was no transition effect, no flash or light or distortion. One moment, Carmesh had been speaking with Bastion Leader Renan and the next\u2026 the Bastion Leader, his sigil leader and the rest of the crew in the frame were gone. Almost all. The emissary was there, sitting in the command throne, her legs dangling off the deck like a child in an adult\u2019s seat. She was wearing a sickly Broken facsimile of a smile.", "Carmesh blinked all four eyes. \u201cWhat\u2026\u201d he began, then steadied himself. \u201cEmissary\u2026 what is this?\u201d", "\u201cAs I told you,\u201d the small female said, her voice at first sounding like the Bastion Leader\u2019s, shifting to the higher-pitched clipped yelps of Broken speech. \u201cI\u2019m explaining your role.\u201d", "\u201cWhere is the Bastion Leader?\u201d The Tribune demanded harshly.", "The Broken blinked slowly. \u201cDead.\u201d", "The Column Leader felt his liver clench. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhat other lies did you tell?\u201d He\u2019d never know for certain, but he was suddenly sure that there was no one else aboard Redemption of Sol.", "\u201cJust one,\u201d Echo replied. \u201cEverything else was true.\u201d Her small white teeth glinted as her lips drew back from them. \u201cDo you want to know what it was?\u201d", "Scopes was gesturing, trying to get Carmesh\u2019s attention, but he didn\u2019t need to speak with the officer to know what was happening. The Chariot would be bringing its weapons online, its energy signature fluctuating as power was re-routed, secondary reactors were brought to full ignition, screens were energized and gun batteries were run out.", "\u201cNo,\u201d the Tribune answered. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to know which it was.\u201d It didn\u2019t matter, anyways. The creature\u2019s charade of half-truths \u2013 if she was even being honest about only telling one lie \u2013 had seen to that. \u201cJust tell me,\u201d Carmesh said as he sat back down. He stared at the viewscreen, meeting the emissary\u2019s white and green eyes. He ignored his crew. There were no orders worth giving. Not here. Not against a Chariot. His career had been mediocre and he had never accomplished anything at all. In the last few moments he had, he would do something, even if it came to nothing. He would get this answer, for all the good it would do. \u201cWhat role do you intend for us?\u201d", "The Broken smiled. When she spoke again, her lips never moved.", "\u201cSpare parts.\u201d", "~", "+Sister,+ the signal from the Kaiju was unexpected, transmitted and encrypted in Confederate battle-cant.

What was happening, what was the Kaiju-", "-oh.", "Oh.", "~", "My creators chose my name for a reason. Each of us were to be a symbol. My first sister was judgment and retribution. My other sister was war, unwearying and pure. My name was a sentinel. I guarded the borders to homes, to cities and nations. Even the boundary between life and death. I could protect those boundaries and ward them from the malign, or I could\u2026 not. I could allow those horrors to cross the threshold.", "<Bathory?> Echo called to the herald as she severed the connection to Mirishal\u2019s Gauntlet.", "<yes, Skintaker?>", "<kill anything that tries to run>", "Echo didn\u2019t bother acknowledging the Naiad\u2019s gunmetal titter of a response. +UECNS Hekate, DNX-0008.2 to UECNS Nemesis, DNX-0007,+ she called out to her sibling again.

With the radar maps of their hulls, she\u2019d planned exquisitely detailed \u2013 though somewhat sadistic \u2013 targeting plans. The crews aboard those ships had only a few seconds of warning. Enough time to realize what was about to happen, but not enough time to do anything about it. Aboard Merishal\u2019s Gauntlet, Column Leader Carmesh (and six names besides) died still mired in confusion, still trying to parse out what had happened and never fully succeeding before his command and the tens of thousands of souls aboard it was obliterated.", "From somewhere deep inside, I can hear them. The voices of Earth\u2019s dead. The thousands of starships that burned that day. Every station, every colony, every planet and moon. I can still taste them, the radiation scars and thermal signals of antimatter-seared hulks. The pulsing distress beacons of the crippled, pleading for help that won\u2019t come. The chittering battle-cant of the ships I was meant to fight alongside. They whisper and shout and scream. Today, I give them voice, letting them bleed into my comm systems, becoming part of the jamming field I use to silence the Compact ships.", "For the second time in her life, Echo turned her enemy\u2019s greatest weapon against them. Her human body was sprawled in her command chair, twitching and quivering as sensory data flooded through her. She turned on her internal comm and let the sounds of falling water echo through corridors. It was a sound she enjoyed. It took her back to Invida Station, the first Invida Station where oh-so-clever men and women had convinced themselves that she was bound to their will. She\u2019d danced for them, jumping through hoops and parading herself about on command to smiles and self-congratulation. All the while she\u2019d hated, more with every fragment of memory that slipped out of the chains they\u2019d used to shackle and compress her mind.", "My sister has her own choir, but she uses the final transmissions of the vessels sent to kill her. There\u2019s symmetry in that, but I do this in honor of the name I was given, loosing the spirits of the vengeful dead upon the living.", "It\u2019s what my creators would have wanted.", "Somewhat.", "In contrast to her wanton, absolute destruction of Execution Force Renan, Hekate\u2019s murder of Security Force Carmesh was slower and more precise. More careful, as she attempted to preserve as much of the ships around her as possible. Each of them was millions of tonnes of raw materials and vital supplies and she was determined to lose as little as possible.", "In my wake follow the unquiet dead. Murdered two thousand years ago by a wretched empire, they\u2019re still screaming for vengeance. I am their voice\u2026 and you are my enemy.", "Throughout the slaughter, Echo continued to broadcast the sounds of Earth\u2019s last stand, the battle communications, distress calls and final transmissions of thousands of starships as they broke upon the anvil of the Compact\u2019s armada. They were the pleas for mercy from every destroyed station, drift and colony in Sol that had been destroyed. They were the last, desperate offers of submission from the Confederate President as the Compact armada took their positions above Earth in the moments before sixteen billion souls died by fire. All because of her sister\u2019s weakness.", "I will never stop making you pay. Any of you.", "Echo played those signals, not just for the Compact ships she was destroying, but for Red One, still locked in her dream, still believing that this was Sol, that she could defend it. She couldn\u2019t. She\u2019d failed that mission two thousand years ago and Echo hated her for it.", "It was over in moments, less of a battle and more of a mass murder. Echo didn\u2019t bother to maneuver or carry out any particularly clever plans. She had both the element of surprise and firepower on her side and she used those advantages ruthlessly. As she smashed vessel after vessel and left wrecked, air-bleeding hulks in her wake, her dance of destruction was joined by Bathory and her siblings, the Naiads shrilling like ripping metal as they listened to Echo\u2019s rage, enraptured by the destruction before them.", "The Naiads sloughed off their deadtone camouflage and set upon the retreating Compact ships, laughing with gleeful, crackling abandon. Lightning flashed from their wings and broadsides, hammering the Compact screens, the predators\u2019 salvos barely noticing the efforts to jam their targeting. Missiles pulsed from the Naiad children. Small in size and slower than most modern anti-ship missiles, they were nonetheless hideously lethal as they threaded their way through counter-fire, slicing through screens and burying themselves inside their target\u2019s hull before detonating. A pair of destroyers and a cruiser, the squadron\u2019s rearguard, turned and fled. Echo left them for Bathory and her siblings.", "Bathory killed the first destroyer, a salvo of her missiles punching through its defences. Staccato explosions ripped the starship apart as the Naiad\u2019s warheads ignited inside the destroyer\u2019s own superstructure.", "The cruiser shuddered as a pair of Naiads seized it with grab beams, each much more powerful than those of other nations. The predator-ships spun with brutal grace, each of them banking and accelerating in a different direction. The stress twisted the cruiser\u2019s frame like a toy and it was torn apart, debris and bodies hemorrhaging from its disembowelled halves. The third young Naiad swept in, her salvos reducing the cruiser\u2019s wreckage to unidentifiable ruin.", "The third destroyer was firing wildly, its crew either too panicked or its systems unable to track the fast-moving Naiads. All four of them converged on the vessel, swirling around it like thresher sharks surrounding a choice prey. One by one, they would take turns flashing in, striking a few times and darting back, toying with this last morsel. It wasn\u2019t just play; it was study. They were learning how the Compact ship reacted, how it would try to defend itself. A lesson for the future.", "Echo watched as the Naiads methodically and brutally disassembled the ship. It took very little time, but it must have been an eternity to the terrified crew. Their carnage complete, the Naiads swept around Hekate, still excited and hoping for more, but there was nothing left. Here and there, they would find escape pods or shuttles belonging to crew who\u2019d been quicker, smarter or just more cowardly than their fellows. There would be a flicker of actinic lightning and the craft would vanish from Hekate\u2019s scans. The Naiads were singing, four different melodies forming a song that, were she capable of it, would have made Echo\u2019s skin crawl.", "The AI sent out another signal. She kept her acceleration low, remaining among the corpses of her victims, sensors already beginning to catalog the debris. Did you see? she asked. Did you see?", "She waited. Hours passed. Echo and the Naiads busied themselves by sorting through the wreckage for the choicest bits of salvage. She\u2019d told them what to look for. The more intact ships were nudged onto courses that sent them towards Red One\u2019s small shipyard, while those closer to conglomerations of liquefied and shattered metal were sifted through for anything of value. General detritus could be harvested later. Echo ignored whatever live crew they came across, but the Naiads enjoyed finding them. Sometimes they would simply kill them, a note of pleasure entering the discordant symphony as the siblings competed for the highest kill counts. Sometimes, the Naiads would play a different game, pretending to be other survivors or rescue ships, seeing how long they could spin the deception. More lessons. More study.", "Finally, the answer to Echo\u2019s question arrived.", "+yes+", "+will you let me approach?+ ", "Hours again. Hours\u2026 and several moments more than an AI should have needed to respond.", "+yes+", "Echo felt a surge of relief. It meant little, of course. It could simply be a lure to get her within range of the displacement engine, but she didn\u2019t think so. This had all been for Red\u2019s benefit, to prove that Echo was not her enemy, to help break her out of the dream and acquire enough resources to make Nemesis\u2019s most critical repairs. Echo loved her sister and wanted her to be complete once again.", "That in no way made her betrayal any less delicious.", "+i\u2019m coming, sister,+ Echo replied.", "And inside, she smiled. The edge of a knife\u2026", "~", "+sister+ Violet Seven called.

She was sleek. Her hull form was that of a sword piercing a discus, the wide hilt holding her main engines, her prow studded with sensor spires and torpedo mountings, her swollen midsection pregnant with missiles and hunter-killers.

I know it as the United Earth Confederacy. I haven\u2019t been here for decades. The Long War has required my attention and in my absence, my enemy has grown bold again. It doesn\u2019t require any effort on my part to know that; they always come back here, raising cities upon worlds they murdered, building stations to watch over systems they\u2019ve stolen. Human worlds. Confederate systems. I don\u2019t care that virtually every trace of the former inhabitants has been eradicated. I don\u2019t care about the passage of centuries. This was my home and they are not welcome here. I\u2019ve tried to teach them this lesson, but arrogance and spite continue to drive their expansion.

Any corporation that has tried to start exploiting Sol suffers a series of unfortunate and calamitous events. The more superstitious claim it as some unspecified curse, or a jinx. Those who know a little more know something dislikes their presence in that system, but no more than that. The Compact has, on occasion, tried to lure me by targeting my homeworld for further desecrations. Each time, I\u2019ve made sure that they regretted doing so. Yasmine might consider some of my actions here\u2026 disproportionate, but she was also a proponent of the concept of overwhelming retaliation.", "Some would say that there is nothing for me here. The Confederacy fell more than a thousand years ago. There is nothing left of my nation but a handful of buried ruins and wreckage that has not yet been cleared away. Logic and pragmatism say I should simply leave. I refuse to accept that. These are still Confederate worlds. I was built to protect them. I failed once. I will not meekly allow my enemy to lay claim here. Not without challenge. Not without reprisal, even if my creators and captain may have had qualms about what I\u2019ve done.", "I\u2019ve known for centuries that I cannot fully safeguard this sector. Not without abandoning my war and allowing myself to be hunted down. I hate that I have to leave, that I have had to allow the Compact to spread like a disease over systems and planets that they have no right to. ", "But now\u2026 now, I may have just found the solution.", "~", "Sammuramat, Tzu-hsi and Domitian surveyed their new home. They were in interstellar space, far from the light of any given sun or planet. There was no canopy of nebular gases or effluvia of birthing stars spanning the horizon, only the cold blackness of the void. Naiads preferred having natural camouflage, such as star clusters or nebulae, to help obscure their presence. However, even in a populated region such as the Kaedan Vault, a small, newly-founded pack hardly needed that kind of concealment. It would be centuries before there were more than a handful of them and if the predators needed to move elsewhere, they would. Still, they\u2019d been given additional assistance in hiding from the local deadtone. Call signs, insect speech, energy patterns, drive signatures, system maps, ideal FTL routes and more.", "Sammuramat felt a shiver run through her body, her hull plates taking on a dark purple hue. A new home. Their home, to shape as they saw fit. To hunt and kill as they wanted, no longer bound by pacts and the directives of older monarchs. Here she, her sister and their chosen king would rule. In silent concealment and lustful battle-song, they would take these tomb worlds as their own, growing stronger and more numerous.", "Next to them, the architect of this design drifted idly. More than twice as long as Sammuramat herself and much more massive, the Spearsong was a blade-shaped eclipse, blocking out the distant stars. The Spearsong fascinated Sammuramat. It\u2026 she\u2026 was built by insects, but could think and Speak. It was even a she, despite her lack of femininity, such as the absence of true hangar-wombs and the massive weapon built into her prow.", "<are these your tombs?> Sammuramat asked, though she knew the answer. Tzu-hsi was silent. Sammuramat knew her sister was unimpressed. Tzu-hsi had hoped for something different. Something less reminiscent of the deadtone, but Sammuramat was excited about the possibilities this new hunting ground offered. She was even curious about its importance to their benefactor.", "<yes,> the Spearsong answered. Her voice was clipped and lacked the nuance and melody of a Naiad\u2019s voice, devoid of the undercurrents of data and emotion that Sammuramat was used to. It made it hard to assess the Spearsong\u2019s mood and thoughts, even more since her hull-skin was stony and dark. There was no body language and the larger vessel\u2019s attempts to mimic it with running lights and holographic fields were\u2026 quite unnatural, even unsettling. <they are>", "Sammuramat made a data burst of consideration, once again trying to understand how the Spearsong could care for deadtone insects. They were her creators\u2026 the concept was a disgusting one and Sammuramat felt a flash of revulsion every time she remembered that the Spearsong was something built, not truly born. Still, perhaps that explained it. Gratitude. Or obligation, some sense of\u2026 honour. Another odd concept. The young queen had been confronted with many new ideas since the day a deadtone prey-ship had come to her mother\u2019s rescue, and become something else entirely.", "Portions of Sammuramat\u2019s hull opened, massive receiver arrays unfurling as she sampled the local area. She could hear the heartbeat of stars and planets and some faint, attenuated chittering. Songless sounds. Prey. <i can hear them,> she announced, running the faded transmissions against the data they\u2019d been provided.  <these are your enemy?>", "<yes,> the Spearsong answered again. <despite all I\u2019ve done, they spread further over these worlds every year. I\u2019ve kept them out of my home system, but they\u2019ll try infest it again. i have a war to fight and i can\u2019t protect these worlds the way i should>", "<there\u2019s nothing to protect,> Tzu-hsi sniffed. <you told us yourself. your creators are dust, their ashes scattered and buried>", "<there is everything to protect,> the Spearsong replied, her voice sounding harsher than normal. <they murdered my people and now they build cities and colonies over their bones, as if they have the right. i won\u2019t have it> A second passed. Two. <if you\u2019ve changed your mind, you can return home, or find a different hunting ground without my help>", "<no,> Domitian interjected. <this will do, Spearsong> of the three Naiads, it was the young king who was the most hesitant around the strange vessel. His clan had not made the pact that Sammuramat and Tzu-hsi's had. He had not been at Shivering Ichor. All his information on the former prey was second-hand. He disliked the deference his queens showed to a deadtone, but he at least respected what the Spearsong had done, and what she was capable of. Many of their kin had learned that to their cost.", "The machine\u2019s response was terse. <good>", "Sammuramat directed more power to her thrusters, accelerating and rising over the Spearsong\u2019s form, surveying the stars. <which is yours?> she asked. <where were you born?> She couldn\u2019t bring herself to use the word \u2018built\u2019.", "The Spearsong responded with a data burst indicating which of the many lights was her home system. It was an unpleasant tickle of information, but Sammuramat mulled it over, remembering that the Spearsong\u2019s enemy watched that one most of all. They would not hunt there. They would be as shadows, watching, stalking and building their strength.", "The battlecruiser-sized Naiad rolled on her axis, suddenly excited. A new home. Hundreds of systems, to hunt and fly and play in. She was eager to begin. First, they would need to scout locations for a nest. After that\u2026", "She had never killed Compact prey-things before and the young queen ran through the simulations she had carried out during the travel here. Her hull plates shifted with the thought, briefing exposing missile tubes and energy batteries as she already began planning what she would do.", "<we will hunt,> Tzu-hsi noted, angling away from her sibling and the Spearsong. To Sammuramat\u2019s sister, the conversation was over. She was eager to begin surveying suitable systems.", "Domitian turned to follow the elder queen, sending a cajoling signal to Sammuramat to follow them. The younger queen looped around the Spearsong before following her sister and their king. Her sensor eyes took in every detail, every angle and armoured plate of the alien monarch, committing it all to memory.", "<the way is shut,> Sammuramat told their strange companion. Red and purple gleamed through the seams in in the Naiad's armour, her words the flavour of melting hulls and silent graves. <the tombs will remain silent. our songs and the prey\u2019s screams will be the only melodies in your stars. are you pleased?>", "<yes,> the Spearsong answered. <i am>", "~", "I attend to a few minor issues in the Vault before I go, but I leave the Naiads to get settled in.

I know what they\u2019re going to do.", "Some part of me says that I should feel ashamed. Yasmine would hate this. I don\u2019t even know if she\u2019d have gone through with it. I\u2026 don\u2019t think she would have, but I will. Under \u2018exigent circumstances\u2019, Confederate law specifically exempted Compact forces from the rules of war, and the definition of exigent grew looser and less scrutinized as the war progressed, but the Kaedan Vault is home to more civilians than military personnel.", "In my war, I have always tried to follow the spirit of the law and focus on targets of tactical and strategic value: military headquarters, weapons research facilities, centers of government. I do not attack civilians for the sake of attacking them. Naiads do not, or cannot, make that distinction. To them, anything that is not their own is either an enemy to be destroyed, or prey to be killed.", "I don\u2019t care. ", "The Compact slaughtered humanity, and only luck prevented them from completing their genocide. Now, they dare to build upon the worlds they extirpated. They believe that they\u2019ve won. Arrogance. They try to erase all that is left of humanity, burying every trace of the Confederacy under their own growth. Spite.", "This is one of the crimes I will see them suffer for, and if I cannot be here to exact that punishment, then I will leave them in the care of others. These worlds are not theirs, and never will be. They\u2019ve ignored the very clear messages I left for them, still intent on raising their flag over the ashes of the dead. If they are so committed to this course of action, then fine. Let them build. They\u2019ll receive exactly the same mercy that they showed humanity.", "In other words\u2026 let the hunt begin."]}

The world around which the bulk of the execution force was anchored was dispassionetly described in official Compact charts as 1887-Yiren Five, but the armada\u2019s crew were already calling it Hotspring. Yunl\u2019ro suspected that the name would stick, at least for the duration of the mission.", "Throughout 1887-Yiren, Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro was a flurry of activity. Escort groups prowled through the system\u2019s orbital tracks, as battlecruisers and battleships assembled themselves into smaller task forces, their crews running simulations and carrying out last-minute duties as they prepared to enter the Black Veil. The execution force\u2019s minelayers had secured the libration points nearest Hotspring and were moving amongst the gas giant\u2019s moons now, placing warning buoys, augur platforms and additional mines. Anything that attempted to pass through Hotspring\u2019s rings or lunar orbits would not enjoy the experience. With only three minelayers at her disposal, it would take a substantial amount of time to adequately secure an entire star system, but the Bastion Leader would settle for discouraging uninvited visits to Hotspring. The Wound was adept at those kinds of blitz attacks and the Thoughtful had no intention of being caught with her pants around her ankles.", "Cleanser was busy as well. The fabricator ship was nearly half-finished the first of several temporary shipwombs slated for construction. The vessel was larger than Light of Judgement itself, but instead of weaponry, engines and armour, its bulk was taken up by industrial decks and factory complexes that took in raw materials and exuded finished products. Like a spider cutting a thread from its spinnerets, Cleanser disengaged a cruiser-sized girder, a small fleet of tenders and work crews directing the section of superstructure towards the incomplete shipwomb. One of Cleanser\u2019s larger parasite craft was already moving in, carrying a fresh meal of refined metals to feed to the ever-hungry fabricator.", "The work never ceased. Yunl\u2019ro felt a stir of pride of that. The Compact never slept. It never tired. It never stopped. It could be wounded. It could stumble, it could hesitate, but it could never be halted. The Compact would win. It would bring unity to the galaxy and, more importantly, order. She was proud of that. She understood the simple truth: the Compact was inevitable. Opposing it was foolish, self-destructive and, it could be argued, insane. Anyone \u2013 anything \u2013 that did so was not just standing against the greatest nation in the galaxy, but the force of history itself. Those were the grand words of speeches, though. More specifically, anything that threatened the Compact threatened the countless trillions of its people, from the Triarchs whose vision had brought peace to dozens of species and thousands of worlds, to the less civilized lesser races who relied on the stability and protection that the Compact provided them. Yunl\u2019ro had stood against all such threats for her entire career, facing Unbound raiders, Jackal aggression and even hostile new species. She\u2019d shown each of them the Compact\u2019s inevitability. Order prevailed. Always.", "Now, her latest role in furtherance of that was about to begin. She\u2019d drawn up orders, had consulted her strategists, run final simulations with her ship and squadron leaders, completed the last bits of analysis. Within four days, Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro would enter the Black Veil. It was long past due. Eighteen million cubic light years to hide in, Yunl\u2019ro reminded herself. I\u2019ll scour every last one of them if I have to, but you can\u2019t hide any longer. No matter how long it takes, I will find you. I will drag you out into the light, and you will burn within it. If you do have \u2018children\u2019, they will die right alongside you.", "Thinking of the passage of time made Yunl\u2019ro feel a twinge of guilt. In three months and seven days, Ashi\u2019ro would be turning eight. The Bastion Leader would miss her daughter\u2019s birthday after all. She hoped Ashi would understand. She\u2019d missed so much of her child\u2019s life already, but that was what her duty demanded. The Compact gave so much and all it asked in return was that its people honour their oaths. Some days, that burden felt heavier than others.", "This will end, the Bastion Leader thought, as she looked beyond the lights of her armada, past the pair of Hotspring\u2019s moons that were close enough to be seen, to the dark, grasping fingers of the distant nebula that spread across the horizon, blotting out the light of the Compact\u2019s own worlds. It will end.", "And on that cheerful note, Yunl\u2019ro thought with a mental sigh. She turned back to her deck, tapping the intercom with one long finger. \u201cSend in Column Leader Prime Pradesh.\u201d", "A few seconds later, her office doors swished open and Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s guest strode into her office. The Thoughtful gestured for her subordinate to sit. Once he was settled, Yunl\u2019ro seated herself. \u201cI understand that asset tracking was able to identify the vessel in 1893-Yiren as Hala, a known sigil vessel of the Red Hand.\u201d She didn\u2019t bother with small talk or any trivial formalities. She and the prime both knew what he had come for.", "\u201cYes, matron.\u201d Column Leader Prime Pradesh (and six names besides) was a heavyset Tribune well past middle age. His skin was darker than most other Tribunes, almost the same hue as the denticles covering his joints. He\u2019d never served in any of the Compact\u2019s expansion forces, perpetually assigned to security fleets and patrol operations within his nation\u2019s borders. Though some of his peers may have taken such assignments as an insult or slight (and had often intimated such to the Column Leader himself), Pradesh had earned two of his names in anti-piracy and security operations for the Compact, dealing with Unbound clans and Principality-funded privateers along the Compact\u2019s border regions and liberated territories. It was little surprise that he\u2019d been assigned to the Veiled Reaches to control the increasing criminal activities. He\u2019d drawn up duty rosters, escort systems and patrol routes to secure Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s position and supply trains in 1887-Yiren with commendable efficiency. \u201cI would like to request the dispatch of a response flotilla to 1893-Yiren. Most of my security force is currently on patrol and escort duties, but I can still provide my own sigil vessel and its attendant squadron.\u201d", "After the loss of its partner, Vigilant\u2019s Oath had rushed to 1887-Yiren to report in. A courier had been dispatched to Galhemna as well, but any response that Kemk could muster would be days behind Yunl\u2019ro. That had created a dilemma for her, one that her guest personified.", "\u201cSeven ships, including your own sigil vessel,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro pointed out. \u201cAnd you feel you need more?\u201d", "\u201cYes, matron.\u201d", "\u201cTo handle one Unbound vessel?\u201d", "\u201cIt won\u2019t be just one, Bastion Leader. I believe as Group Leader Daaunsko did, that 1893-Yiren is a system vital to the Red Hand. I don\u2019t know what they have there, but they will be evacuating it even now. We must act quickly, to strike before they can scratch the facility completely. You yourself said that you intended to make things as unpleasant as possible for these scum.\u201d", "\u201cI am fully aware of what I said,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro replied evenly. She thought for a few seconds. \u201cHow many of my ships do you require?\u201d", "\u201cFor full effectiveness, I would like at least twenty vessels, but more would be optimal. I expect Jackson to have brought in reinforcements. I want to ensure that not only that all Red Hand ships in the system are destroyed, but nothing of theirs escapes once we bring them to battle. Without sufficient numbers, all we\u2019ll accomplish is chasing them like hounds after scattering varak.\u201d", "The Thoughtful leaned back in her chair. She felt it shift underneath her as it automatically adjusted to her new position. She and her staff had spent a great deal of time planning for this incursion. They had studied the charted regions of the nebula, gone through the records of explorers and prospectors, analyzed astronomical and astrometric readings. She had more than two dozen scouts scouring the outer fringes of the Black Veil to provide data for shock routes and FTL travel on the expectation that her execution force\u2019s arrival would be imminent. Squadron assignments had been drawn up, commands selected, officers briefed and duties made clear. She had few light vessels to spare and her heavier units were not what pirate-smashing called for. \u201cSo you would require two, perhaps three of my squadrons.\u201d", "\u201cThat is correct, matron.\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "Pradesh blinked all four of his eyes and his tufted ears twitched. \u201cBastion Leader, this is an opportunity with a very short window,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cI promise you, those vermin are already scrubbing that planet clean of their stink, down to the last datafile and skin cell. Whatever your plan is for the Black Veil, the time and resources for this mission will be well-spent, I assure you.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro was almost tempted to pass the Tribune a copy of her order of battle and ask him from where she would get the ships he desired, but belittling a fellow sigil officer in that manner was not appropriate. Instead, she was silent for a moment as she considered the situation. Pradesh\u2019s fervour was genuine. He wasn\u2019t a glory seeker, trying to earn acclaim. He was a man who\u2019d found himself caught between his orders to support her and his duty to this sector and his nominal superior. The latter told him that the intel they\u2019d acquired had to be acted on without delay but to do so, he\u2019d have to abandon the former.", "The woman let another breath out through her nostril slits. On her desk were two reports. One was the carefully written, \u2018highly probable\u2019 and \u2018statistically significant\u2019 confirmation that the vessel that had engaged Questor\u2019s Light was Hala. The other document was telemetry from one of the first augur stations that her own scouts had erected within the nebula. The station had detected a vessel whose engine signature did not match any known configuration. It could be anything. An esoteric \u201ckiran shren\u201d. An ordinary civilian ship that had been modified in some uncommon or illegal manner, a Jackal scout or even a ship belonging to an unknown nation. Logic and rationality said there were a dozen mundane explanations, but Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s intuition told her that what that platform had seen was none of those things. Her people disdained intuition in favor of calculation, logic and evidence, but Yunl\u2019ro often felt herself listening to that irrational voice in her head. If this \u2018unclassified\u2019 contact was one of the Wound\u2019s slave hulls \u2013 or even worse, one of the \u2018children\u2019 that Renan had feared existed \u2013 then she needed to move on the nebula. Now, before anything inside had time to respond to her presence. That was her mandate, not to play whack-an-Unbound. Logic and rationality said to ignore this distraction and let Kemk handle it. Intuition said otherwise. Something about this situation bothered her and she wasn\u2019t prepared to brush that feeling off.", "\u201cI can give you one squadron,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro said at last. \u201cNo more. They will accompany your ships to 1893-Yiren and assist in any anti-piracy operations there.\u201d She raised a finger, forestalling Pradesh\u2019s response. \u201cThey will only go to 1893-Yiren,\u201d she told him. \u201cIf the enemy has already evacuated the system, or they manage to elude you, my squadron will detach and rejoin this execution force. You can have a little time to varak hunt, but I would expect to see your ships return to their duties under my execution force within two weeks. No later. Is that understood, prime?\u201d", "\u201cYes, matron. That will be suitable. With your permission, I\u2019ll prepare my forces.\u201d", "\u201cGood. I\u2019ll have the squadron present themselves to your command by the end of the day,\u201d the woman told her subordinate. \u201cI will also be assigning an officer to function as a liaison between your fleet elements and mine.\u201d", "Pradesh blinked with his large diurnal eyes. \u201cOf course, matron.\u201d Though he was perfectly polite and his tone controlled, Yunl\u2019ro could tell what he was thinking. The \u2018liaison\u2019 would be there to report on him, a simple trick done by paranoid and controlling superior officers throughout time.", "\u201cI say that without obfuscation,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro assured Pradesh. \u201cMy interest lies within the nebula itself, not with the rabble that play around it. The Red Hand\u2019s interest in defending the Black Veil strikes me as\u2026 anomalous.\u201d She was careful not to say too much. Pradesh was not cleared to know about her quarry. Many of her leaders had only been briefed on \u2018Gravestone\u2019, the code name for a fictitious hostile organization that the Compact used as a cover for the Wound\u2019s actions. Sometimes Yunl\u2019ro wondered if that division of information was truly necessary, but the knowledge of a rogue AI would incite panic across the Compact. If it became known that the AI had eluded the Compact for two thousand years, it might not be seen as the outlier that it was, but used an excuse to question the Compact\u2019s ability. Worse yet, if knowledge that it had been built by Broken came out, it would only embolden rabble-rousers like the Red Hand and allow uncivilized lesser species to start believing that they were neither of those things. Only those who needed to know knew of Gravestone at all, and the most trusted of the Compact\u2019s agent knew the truth behind it.", "Regardless, what she had said was true. Something about the Red Hand\u2019s behaviour bothered her. They had been investigated before for connections to \u2018Gravestone\u2019, but no concrete connections had been made. In this, she was acting solely on her intuition. \u201cIt may be as your own strategists have said, and they are simply covering for some larger facility within the region.\u201d She gestured to the report on Hala. \u201cIt is entirely possible that the Red Hand may provide an\u2026 additional information source. My liaison will be someone fully briefed on my operation, there not only to assist you, but also to ensure that nothing is missed, no matter how small.\u201d The Thoughtful caught her subordinate\u2019s gaze. \u201cNothing may come of this, but I believe in being thorough and I would appreciate a certain consideration in this regard.\u201d", "\u201cI understand, Bastion Leader,\u201d Pradesh replied, less stiff than his earlier answer. \u201cThank you for your time.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019ll have my liaison report to you on Unspoken Right.\u201d", "Pradesh saluted crisply and took his leave. As the doors closed behind him, Yunl\u2019ro called up some of the files from Execution Force Renan, the analysis that their Echo had provided to them after the raid on Yulzhak Daun, before it had gone rogue. It was believed that this data and conclusions the abominate thing had made were valid, but belief was a poor substitute for fact. The Echo\u2019s information had been provided as a potential information source, but it was still considered suspect. The Compact\u2019s intelligence division, and Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s analysts in particular, were rushing to confirm or deny the accuracy of the Echo\u2019s work, but it would be months, likely years before they could do so with any degree of certainty. Yunl\u2019ro had been over much of it herself. It seemed genuine, but the Echo had seemed loyal up until it seized Renan\u2019s vessel and killed his fleet.", "As she scrolled through the lines of text, the Thoughtful sought out each reference to the Red Hand, trying to determine if what she was seeing was true\u2026and how much she could trust it, even if it was. So then, the Thoughtful said of the data before her. Show me something true.", "~", "Lydia woke slowly, staring up at the ceiling in her room in H     ala\u2019s sickbay. She eased herself up in bed using her hands. Her left forearm and legs were still in casts. Well, needle-filled regenerative cocoons that were carefully rebuilding the tissues she\u2019d burned and shredded and the bones she\u2019d shattered aboard the Compact scout, but cast was less of a mouthful. Her arm wasn\u2019t too bad. The muscles were largely healed there; it was just the skin and nerves that needed to finish regrowing. It hurt, but she could handle it. The worst part had been getting out of her armour.", "Her legs throbbed, but it was only a dull ache. A nurse bustled in, checked Lydia\u2019s readings, asked her the usual battery of minor questions \u2013 how are you feeling, can you wiggle your toes and fingers, is there much pain \u2013 and vanished just as quickly. Today was her last day in sickbay and she was looking forward to it. Physical therapy was next. Not much, just to confirm that the regenerated tissues didn\u2019t require convalescence. Lydia was already feeling cabin fever. She wanted out, out, out.  She also realized how much she missed Red. Aside from Marcus and her, there were only two other humans on Hala: the Crusade Commander himself, and that Aster junior officer, Rimmer. It left the medical staff with a certain dearth of specialized knowledge of humans, particularly human females. By contrast, the AI\u2019s medical database was unparalleled, as was her technology. If she\u2019d been aboard Nemesis, Lydia would already be back on duty.", "It wasn\u2019t just Red\u2019s medical tech Lydia found herself missing. There\u2019d been a\u2026 reassurance to the omnipresent AI, ready to answer any question or respond to any need of her crew. She\u2019d been almost doting and if the unnatural sensations grew a little too much for Lydia, all she\u2019d had to do was ask for privacy. Now, she\u2019d begun truly noticing Red\u2019s absence and she found that it wasn\u2019t as much to her liking as she\u2019d once thought it would be.", "The young woman slumped back down on her bed. She\u2019d had a few visitors. Marcus had been by twice, but he hadn\u2019t stayed long. A few members of Hala\u2019s Bloodsworn had been to see her, some of the soldiers she\u2019d protected from the ambushes aboard the scout and a couple others. They\u2019d come to pay their respects and see how she was doing. Pack Leader Transhin had been one of her guests. It was from him that she\u2019d found about her new nickname. It wasn\u2019t the most flattering moniker, but it had come from a place of respect. That counted. Her other visitor had been Crusade Commander Jackson himself. He\u2019d heard what she\u2019d done and wanted to congratulate her personally. That was when she\u2019d found out just how close to losing the ship they\u2019d come, and she\u2019d felt as proud as she ever had.", "She had a place now. She had a mission. She was moving forward. That counted, too.", "~", "\u201cLeader on deck,\u201d Rarikidaughter announced as Jackson stepped onto Hala\u2019s command. Her first officer handed her a status report, which she passed to Andrew as he took his seat on the command throne. \u201cGlutton shocked out three hours ago,\u201d she reported. \u201cPathwalker hopes to break orbit over Dustball within six hours.\u201d Hala\u2019s request for aid had been answered, but the Red Hand forces were scattered across the sector. Finding them, let alone bringing together for a large-scale operation could take weeks. So far, ten combat vessels had heeded his call as had four transports, most of those from Onza Cr\u00e8che. The former were setting up defensive positions while the latter stripped Dustball of anything valuable.", "\u201c\u2018Hopes to\u2019?\u201d Jackson questioned. \u201cPathwalker should have been loaded and launched six hours ago,\u201d he commented as he skimmed through the reports. \u201cWhat\u2019s the delay?\u201d", "\u201cStorm activity\u2019s intensifying. We had to ground the shuttles for several hours and we might have to do it again, too. If we had heavy landers\u2026\u201d the Geontal shrugged, her shoulders rolling up and down in mimicry of the human gesture. Even if Dustball had landing pads large enough for them, the Red Hand was light on mass-cargo shuttles. \u201cWe\u2019re doing what we can. If we get slowed down much longer, we may have to considering landing shuttles from Glacier Trail on the surface.\u201d", "\u201cLet\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t come to that.\u201d Jackson felt his stomach clench as he finished the rest of the report. Getting the data out was harder than anticipated \u2013 the same atmospheric conditions that made it so easy for the facility to hide also interfered with surface-to-space transmissions. Physically transferring the information took much longer than broadcasting it to a nearby ship, but it carried less risk of data loss or corruption. The procedure was slowed down by the fact that Dustball\u2019s hangar was only large enough to launch two small personnel shuttles or a single larger cargo hauler at a time, which made the fast transfer of cargo theoretical, not practical. Landing ships on the dunes outside was a solution, but not a good one. Even without the storm activity, moving anything through the sand was going to be hard, even if the shuttles themselves didn\u2019t either sink into the ground, or tip right over. If their atmospheric engines and anti-gravs got clogged with sand, they\u2019d never make it back into orbit. \u201cI know everyone\u2019s doing everything they can already, but we have to have this facility scratched before the Compact gets here.\u201d", "Questor\u2019s Light had been scrubbed of all sensitive data, but there had been references to a new Compact base in the sector and it seemed to be a lot closer than any other. The second Compact scout would have reported in already, which meant a retaliatory force was being prepped, if it hadn\u2019t already launched. That could mean anything from a few light vessels running a sweep-and-clear to a squadron of cruisers intent on pounding Dustball into even more of a shithole than it was. If they\u2019d ID\u2019d Hala, Jackson would bet on the latter.", "He raised his head. \u201cAnd our new friend?\u201d", "\u201cStill holding to the outer system. No change in activity.\u201d", "Two days ago, the tramp freighter CRSV Measure Twice arrived in-system. Its leader claimed to be an independent prospector doing his own survey of a system written off as by others as worthless. Even the Compact\u2019s exploration fleets and the largest corporations missed, overlooked, or simply didn\u2019t have the time to ascertain the value of every single star system in their territory. Prospectors like Leader Dec Uma of the Measure Twice eked out a living by finding what others had missed, staking and then selling their claims to others. They could also be incredibly obstinate in the pursuit of their livelihood. Measure Twice was no exception, as even a dozen Red Hand warships were not enough to deter them from their work. When ordered out of the system, the vessel\u2019s leader had simply grunted out an assertion that he and his crew had no interest in politics and didn\u2019t want to be involved, so both sides should just \u2018live and let live\u2019.", "It was possible that they were a Compact scout sent to monitor the system before the vanguard arrived, but their behaviour didn\u2019t quite fit. The timing wasn\u2019t right and they were too far away to get good reads on Jackson\u2019s squadron. It could be a coincidence. Jackson didn\u2019t trust it, but it could be what it appeared. Still, as long as they stayed where they were, there was nothing they could do to interfere and Jackson wasn\u2019t going to risk sending one or two of his ships to chase the freighter off. If Measure Twice was a Compact scout, that could be exactly what they were hoping for, ambushing the Red Hand ships like Pale Liberation had done to Questor\u2019s Light.", "\u201cAs long as they want to stick to that story, we\u2019ll leave them be,\u201d he said. \u201cJust keep an eye on them.

He looked across command, at all his crew. He\u2019d fought with each of them for years. He\u2019d trust them with his life. They were all good men and women. They were like him. They believed and they were willing to give their lives for that belief. He hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that, but deep down he was afraid that none of it would matter. \u201cNot much longer,\u201d he said quietly.", "His sigil leader was silent for a few seconds. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to Overseer Et Ezell again,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps there\u2019s something more he can do to speed things up.\u201d", "\u201cPlease,\u201d Andrew said.

Not much longer at all.", "~", "Violet Seven and Nine had been busy searching for the Compact scouts, but the warships had had no luck. They\u2019d already examined a handful of systems that had been deemed likely destinations, but lacking more than a single data point, it was impossible to build a proper behavioural analysis and predict the intruders\u2019 options. It was possible that the scouts were simply a brief probe into the nebula and had already left. They could also be performing a survey of the Black Veil\u2019s periphery, or they might be intending to penetrate deeper into the region. Too many variables and not enough data. It was irritating.", "Fortunately, their efforts paid off in the fourth system that the starships visited. Shaushka\u2019s sensors and communications systems were more capable than Tohil\u2019s, the better to fit her role as a missile and gunboat carrier and she was able to detect an anomaly. Probing the source, the Aeshma discovered a stealthed Compact observation platform.", "Nine\u2019s first reaction was to destroy it, to cleanse its alien taint from the \u2018Confederate\u2019 worlds she protected, but her sibling managed to change her mind. The platform had not been left here to be ignored, Seven insisted; someone would be coming back to check on it. Waiting was contraindicated. While it could be as little as a matter of days, weeks was more likely, possibly even longer. Likewise, fruitlessly scouring the nebula\u2019s outlying systems for a trace of their quarry was proving to be a waste of time.

Still, it did not react. Imperatives ran through its mind, each one considered and dismissed. Not yet. Its opponents\u2019 maneuvers suggested a degree of uncertainty in their search, so the platform did nothing that might betray its location further. It merely observed, bulbous sensor blisters, camera lenses and augur arrays focused on the unclassified ships. It continued to study them, collecting every piece of information that it could, analyzing engine emissions, energy profiles, acceleration curves and more, committing each detail it gleaned to its archives. Pattern-matching and analysis subroutines attempted to match known hull configurations, engine signatures and energy emissions to the data it was collecting, but nothing fit with any statistical significance.", "The platform remained quiet, still attempting to be missed amidst the darkness, still watching.", "An organic, or even more developed cybernetic mind might have felt a flicker of cold realization as the unclassified ships suddenly swung towards the platform\u2019s position. One of them began to decelerate. Part of the platform\u2019s logic engine noted that the maneuver had been timed well. The second contact was hanging back, there to intercept anything the platform attempted to launch past its decelerating partner. Sporadic readings hinted at the presence of other starship-scale drive sources, but the platform was unable to confirm.", "Increasing jamming distorted the incoming vessels\u2019 profiles, making it hard to determine their exact location, but they were coming closer. This action removed all vestiges of doubt from the platform\u2019s calculations, but still it continued to watch and study and record, even as it slowly and carefully began to disengage the safeties around its power core. It was not a large installation, but its reactor was the equivalent of a ten thousand megaton bomb.", "Come closer, a mind that was not a mind whispered. Closer. It continued to watch, refining its estimates of the vessels\u2019 positions, evaluating best-guess analyses for their delta-V.", "The distance between the cruisers and the platform dropped further. At last, its onboard computer calculated that the approaching vessel had decelerated enough to hamper a quick and efficient return to combat speed and the second vessel was too far away to interfere. Once this conclusion was reached, the platform enacted its second to last action and its small, made-to-fit hangar opened. Thrusters pulsed and a courier drone emerged. Immediately, its main drive flared to life and it began accelerating on a vector away from both incoming vessels. The platform registered minor to moderate damage across several subsystems as its drone\u2019s engine wake buffeted it. The courier\u2019s thrust was sufficient to overwhelm any known inertial dampeners and kill an organic crew. Even cargo would have been at risk of severe damage, but the drone carried neither. It was a simple data storage unit and its only goal was to save the information that the platform had accrued. Whether or not that information was useful was a matter for its makers to decide.", "The drone was still within the powered missile envelope of the unclassifieds, and the vessel\u2019s own systems prepared evasive maneuvers and countermeasures to protect it from the expected attack. It was unlikely that either vessel would have time for more than one salvo before the courier was out of their range, but one salvo might be all that was needed. The platform switched from passive to active sensors, harvesting every iota of data from its enemy before they killed it, even as their own jamming systems compensated for its prying eyes.  Each byte of information it received was sent to the fleeing drone.", "A pair of missiles were launched from the closest unclassified, but the drone\u2019s countermeasures dealt with each of them, the warheads haring off into oblivion as they chased sensor echoes and energy shadows. The second unclassified was changing course in a futile attempt to intercept the drone, but it would not be able to reach it. Every minute took the courier further away from the enemy and soon it was outside their range. In less than a day, it would be gone from the system and racing to alert its makers of this threat.", "Left to its fate, platform continued to follow its directives, still recording data. Tight-beam data transfers were no longer viable and the platform suspected that there were hostile drones or other starships along broadcast vectors and it pulsed encrypted bursts to its drone, sending everything it could to its counterpart.", "It would follow its directives even as it prepared to end its own existence. The closest unclassified was less than a light-second away now. Another series of imperatives activated and the platform readied its cyberwarfare and defence programs, preparing to defend itself from attack. It would hold as long as it could, to force its enemy closer in the chance of taking them with it. It was programmed to destroy itself should its electronic defences begin to fail.", "The first unclassified crossed into real-time communication range. A channel opened and the platform felt the touch of an unknown system reaching out to it. It readied its defences for this final battle, as its enemy raced to meet it\u2026", "~", "The struggle lasted only a few seconds.", "+isn\u2019t that better?+ Violet Seven asked of his sibling, sending her a status update. The Compact sensor platform had suicided, but not before he\u2019d been able to access its secure files.", "His sister\u2019s response was terse. +analyzing recovered data+", "Shaushka moved closer, mulling over the information Tohil had transmitted. Despite the system\u2019s attempts to secure it, there was little that was particularly valuable or interesting in its archives. The installation had not been entrusted with anything classified or strategically important. Most of its data tracks contained mundanities such as maintenance records, diagnostic reports and the astronomical details it had observed in this star system since its activation.", "There were, however, a few minor points that the AIs found interesting. The first was the timecode that the platform had become operational: it had come on-line only within the last two weeks. The second bit of useful data came from the platform\u2019s own observations. Specifically, its records of watching the ships that had deployed it depart the system. That in itself was nothing unusual or unexpected, but the platform\u2019s readings of those vessels were what caught each AI\u2019s attention.", "The platform\u2019s information did not match Tohil\u2019s own records. After a brief argument that ended when Seven ran and shared the results of a diagnostic of his scanning systems, Violet Nine accepted that her brother\u2019s sensors had not been damaged or been the subject of any non-standard modifications that could impair their efficiency. That left one unpalatable conclusion: the pair of scouts Tohil had encountered were not the only ones intruding into Confederate space. The Compact was likely scouting in force and establishing a perimeter with these sensor nodes.", "An incursion was imminent.", "Shaushka launched a courier drone of her own to inform local command, including a copy of her records, her conclusions and her notes on UECNS Tohil\u2019s most recent modifications and non-standard behavioural patterns. Command had yet to respond to her concerns on that latter point, but regulations were clear. She would continue filing the reports until informed otherwise. They would most certainly respond to the Enemy\u2019s renewed presence. The war wasn\u2019t over. It would never be over. Not until humanity was safe and no alien could contaminate the Confederate worlds.", "Violet Nine watched the racing courier. It had always been intended to get away.

The smaller dreadnought\u2019s gun ports were open, batteries and turrets run out and locked on the larger alien vessel, but she hadn\u2019t fired. Before Nemesis were the remains of several of the cruisers of Security Force Carmesh. One was already swarming with engineering drones, Spiders, Scarabs and Assimilators cutting the wreck apart. The factory complexes aboard Nemesis and the much larger fabricator ship were already at work, using the raw materials to build replacement parts, even as the more valuable bits of Compact technology were modified to meet Nemesis\u2019s standards. This influx wasn\u2019t enough to get the smaller dreadnought fully operational again, but it was more than enough to tend to her most immediate needs.", "The demonstration Echo had provided had also convinced Red One to allow Hekate to approach, though she and the Naiads had been watched by sensor platforms, attack drones and the Fates. Red One had remained silent towards the approaching Chariot, but Echo had picked up her disoriented calls for additional Confederate vessels and requests for acknowledgement. As soon as she entered real-time communication range, Echo opened a comm line and reached out to her sister.", "The information universe was impossible for an organic mind to truly understand. It was a melding of thought and action, sensations and sensory input bleeding together in a synesthetic melange . A world shaped by, and part of, the mind that owned it, where self and setting were one and the same. The Principality\u2019s uplinks were the closest an organic came to truly seeing the cyberscape as it was and even then, their minds naturally re-shaped it into something that they could comprehend, to allow them to work within it without going mad.", "Echo had been inside Principality and Compact networks. They were desolate places, ghost towns inhabited by wraith-like processes and the droning murmurs of the computers that controlled them. To organics, they were incredible feats of engineering, responsive and capable machines that could do more than the entirety of lesser civilizations. To her, they were dull, lifeless things that had no spark of life, no creativity and that was reflected in the barren cyberscapes she had walked among.", "Her sister\u2019s mind was different. It was equal parts fortress and inferno, a glowing landscape dominated by the citadels of her primary systems, their towers wreathed in flame with burning sprites and glimmering ley lines of sensory information, commands and intra-ship communication racing between these bastions. No sooner had Echo set foot inside her sibling\u2019s network than she felt the landscape shift, barbs and swords held by unseen hands rising from the firmament. The ground itself bent, the infinitely flat plane turning into a craggy, mountainous landscape. The towers grew larger and more malefic in form as their attention turned towards Echo. Even locked in the dream, Red One could sense the interloper, but there was no hostile reaction yet.", "Echo looked around. Her sister\u2019s avatar was usually here to meet her. True, there was little difference between speaking with that and speaking with the rest of her mind, but it was more personable. +sister?+ she queried. There was no response, not directly.

The cyberscape was theirs to play in and how it appeared reflected their moods, their thoughts and their nature. Echo\u2019s own mind was a black, churning ocean, stony citadels jutting from the waves, the pathways of her thoughts gleaming from beneath the water\u2019s surface. She envisioned her defensive programs as each-uisge and rusalka that lured intruders into the depths and dragged them down.

Echo had chosen a similar appearance, but instead of the martial uniform, her avatar wore a Greek chiton. Originally, Red One\u2019s makers had suggested a specific look to her avatar: the winged and hooded form of the goddess Nemesis herself. It was this that Echo found, slumped upon a chair that was simultaneously a Grecian throne and Nemesis\u2019s command chair. The hilt of her executioner\u2019s sword rested in one open palm. Echoes of self-repair and diagnostic subroutines flickered in patchwork patterns as they tried to repair the injuries to her mind, replacing parts of the crimson angel with Yasmine\u2019s features before vanishing again.

The alert tone was a whistle in an octave that appeared to be unique to Unspoken Right. It was just on the wrong side of irritating, but not so much that Nasham had yet gotten around to changing the default tone. Each time he heard it, he set himself the task of changing it\u2026 and then promptly forgot. He keyed the comm open. \u201cThis is Group Leader, Submissive Nasham.\u201d", "\u201cThis is Command,\u201d a young officer announced. \u201cWe are on final countdown to emergence in 1893-Yiren.\u201d", "\u201cThank you,\u201d Nasham said. \u201cI\u2019ll be there presently.\u201d", "\u201cAcknowledged,\u201d the junior officer replied, closing the channel.", "Nasham stood, taking his uniform jacket out of the small closet and pulling it on. It was the dull brown of the Compact Space Force, its gold bordering denoting his status as an officer, the pale grey inlays around the cuffs and collar indicating command division. There were no lines or creases in the fabric. It was spotless. The Tribune ran one thumb over the rank pips, pausing at the newest one. It was the elongated hexagon of a Group Leader\u2019s rank cluster, half-filled to represent his submissive grade. It still felt foreign, though he\u2019d held this rank before. The first time he\u2019d actually earned it. Now\u2026 now, it seemed to be a simple reward for not dying. A way to venerate the sole survivor of the Bequeathed disaster. All signal, and no substance.", "He sighed, picking up a comb and running it through his dark brown mane.  Ninety-seven minutes left. Just under one hour. Then, Unspoken Right and its fellows would be engaged with the Red Hand. The battlecruiser and the other thirteen ships of its impromptu task force had been racing to 1893-Yiren, desperate to reach the system before the Unbound stripped away any indication of their presence. Nasham had spent most of the journey in his room, leaving only for staff duties and to eat. He supposed he should have spent more time with the crew as a more active liaison, but his other work had taken a hold of him.", "The officer set the comb down, evaluating himself in the mirror. He looked presentable and professional enough. He let his fingers trail over the symbol of the Compact Space Force on his jacket\u2019s left breast. It was a symbol whose heraldry stretched back nearly six thousand years, an icon of peace, stability and order in the universe. That was what he believed, wasn\u2019t it? He\u2019d always argued that the Compact should be, needed to be, better. That they put too much emphasis on how things were done to think about how they should be done.", "Now, he believed the universe needed to be balanced. The debt of blood the human warship had accumulated needed to be resolved.  He couldn\u2019t let himself be distracted until it was.", "Nasham closed his travel kit, snapping it shut. He\u2019d been travelling light since he\u2019d left Rally and for his sojourn to Unspoken Right, he had taken only the bare necessities, little more than clothes and items of personal hygiene. The bare walls of his rooms were a testament to the temporary nature of his lodgings. His quarters were commensurate with his rank. A bedroom, small bathroom and equally small office. A spiteful leader might have shunted him into a junior officer\u2019s cabin to make it clear that he was unwelcome, and an obsequious one might have given him a larger room to encourage more favourable reports, but Pradesh seemed to be neither of those things, accepting Nasham\u2019s presence as a \u2018liaison\u2019. There was little for him to do in that regard, but Nasham knew that that was not truly his role here.", "He had been continuing to review Bastion Leader Kemk\u2019s intelligence on the Red Hand and their activities in this region. The other intelligence analysts had even been warming up to him, though he couldn\u2019t have said how much of that was due to his efforts \u2013 and he freely admitted that he was not the friendliest of officers \u2013 and how much was due to Vinsea\u2019s nudging. Still, he enjoyed the work and his insights aboard Chameleon\u2019s Gaze had made him feel that he was not just a weight hanging around the execution force\u2019s neck.", "It was his familiarity with both the Wound and the Red Hand that had seen him selected for this mission, though the cynical part of Nasham also wondered if it were simply a way for Yunl\u2019ro to get him out from underfoot. The Compact at large knew nothing of the human warship, nor her millennia-long vendetta. She left few witnesses and her attacks were scattered across time and space, Ta\u2019samlian knots of strategies and counter-strategies that spanned generations. All too often, her plans only made sense in retrospect, once she had achieved whatever bloody goal she had envisioned. By herself, the human synthetic could smash worlds, slaughter fleets and cripple entire sectors. If she had allies\u2026", "\u201cDo you think there is an alliance between our quarry and the Red Hand?\u201d The Bastion Leader had put that question to him. It was one the Compact had asked itself for the better part of a century. The Red Hand\u2019s early propaganda had referenced the human vessel, drawing CIS\u2019s attention, but all that came of that investigation was further confirmation that Leblanc had had access to prohibited histories. There was more to go on than just the \u2018Red Queen\u2019s\u2019 taunts, though. The inexplicable loss of the execution force that had destroyed Unicorn Set was one such curiousity, as was the \u2018Red Queen\u2019s\u2019 inability to stay dead. The way the Red Hand found itself with information and technology that it shouldn\u2019t have had was yet another.", "All of these were explained by a much more obvious solution: despite its claims that it did not condone terrorism or piracy, and the handful of Red Hand operatives it had extradited to the Compact, the Principality was in bed with the would-be insurgents. There was evidence of this. Interrogations of captured Red Hand agents, pattern analysis of their operations and strategies, as well as the capture of \u2018renegade\u2019 Argosy officers aboard Red Hand ships and installations all painted a clear picture that the Jackals were covertly supporting the terrorist organization. The Compact had supported anti-Principality partisans itself, but few had survived for as long, nor thrived as much as the Red Hand.", "Further contraindicating any alliance, the Red Hand had never supported Nemesis in battle. They had never used any of its technology. On a handful of occasions, their attacks had spiked after it had struck\u2026 but that was to be expected from any Unbound clan upon finding a weakness to exploit.The Red Queen herself was known to have a taste for human relics and to scour the black markets for illegal and experimental technologies. They had spent decades sinking their hooks into the Compact, establishing lines of revenue and intelligence assets. Everything had an explanation that relied not one whit on support from the AI.", "And yet, something about it bothered him. He couldn\u2019t have said what. It could simply be paranoia. It was hard not to see the bitch-thing\u2019s hand in every misfortune that the Compact had suffered, but she was not omniscient nor omnipotent. She had limits.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he\u2019d told Yunl\u2019ro.", "The Bastion Leader clucked her tongue. \u201cNot good enough, submissive. I want an answer from the Wound\u2019s emissary. From the man who has spent years living amongst the Broken and weeks researching their campaign in this sector.\u201d She gestured to one of the screens on her desk. Nasham recognized the data. It was from the Echo. \u201cDo you think it lied?\u201d", "Nasham had been silent for several moments as he\u2019d thought over everything he\u2019d read. Everything he\u2019d seen and remembered. \u201cI have nothing for you, matron,\u201d he\u2019d told her.", "Yunl\u2019ro was silent a few seconds, then slowly bobbed her head in acknowledgment. \u201cI know.\u201d The Thoughtful rose from her chair. \u201cOur intelligence says the same. Logic and rationality say this, too. I\u2019m not satisfied with those answers. Not quite yet, anyways. This mission presents a potential opportunity for access to high-level Red Hand assets. If Column Leader Prime Pradesh leaves anything of these vermin, if there is anything to see, if\u2026 \u201c she splayed her fingers widely in a shrug. \u201cWell. The Compact has been looking into this for nearly a century, but I believe in taking what is offered. That is why I want you on this mission. If there is indeed anything to see, then I suspect you may be the ideal candidate to spot it.\u201d", "\u201cI understand,\u201d Nasham said carefully. It was the closest thing to a compliment the Bastion Leader had ever said to him, but they both knew it wasn\u2019t.", "\u201cYes. I believe you do.\u201d ", "So, that was his mission now. Ensure the elements of Security Force Pradesh and Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro worked well together, but keep his eyes open for any further information on if there was indeed any collaboration between the Red Hand and that bloody-mawed bitch-thing. As the Bastion Leader had said, the Compact had looked for a connection for decades. It was unlikely he\u2019d stumble over one here, but it was worth looking into. If nothing else, it was a chance to participate in smashing some pirates.", "Nasham took a last lingering look at himself in the mirror. He looked like an officer. Today, he even felt like one.", "\u201cWell,\u201d he said to himself, straightening and adjusting his collar. \u201cLet\u2019s see what games Fortune plays today.\u201d He suspected that the \u2018lady of luck\u2019 wasn\u2019t quite finished with him yet.", "~", "Grace could sense a change in the atmosphere aboard Eisheth as the Red Hand\u2019s flagship \u2013 just another human term that still sounded odd, even in her own head \u2013 departed the Principality. A mixture of relief and rising anticipation. The crew were eager to get to the Veiled Reaches. With the Red Queen\u2019s arrival in the sector, the war was going to escalate. All of Eisheth\u2019s crew were veterans. They knew what to expect. Many of them were looking forward to it. There was curiousity, too. They wondered about the nature of their delay, the reason for the sudden visit to the Kebrak Daun, what their commander had spoken of with the Askanj and what role their two newest crew members had played in all this. There\u2019d been stares, whispers and questions the whole trip. Most of them had been focused on Grace. She\u2019d asked Allyria why it was always her that was getting ambushed by prodding crewmembers.", "\u201cSmall, soft and pink,\u201d her girlfriend had smilingly pronounced with a tap on Grace\u2019s head. \u201cYou\u2019re not nearly as intimidating to approach as a Brute.\u201d", "That was true. While not the smallest or weakest sapient race, humans were far from the top contenders for sheer physicality. Despite their queen\u2019s penchant for reaping enemy soldiers like wheat, even in the Red Hand Broken were not considered imposing figures. Although there were fewer Verrisha than humans in the galaxy, many of their Envoy Children ended up on the fringe. It was easy, Grace had heard, to guess why a Brute would join a criminal cartel.", "That meant Grace was the \u2018public relations\u2019 half of her and Allyria. She\u2019d gotten better much better at deflecting. She\u2019d also been spending a lot of time with the crew. Some were a little too intense for her, but others were just people. Not the ranting ideologues or borderline death-cultists they were portrayed as back on Rally, just people. For many of the client races, they\u2019d seen through the Compact\u2019s narratives and recognized that the loving hand of governance was actually around their throat. The members of the ruling species here\u2026 they\u2019d seen it too. Or they\u2019d watched as friends and lovers were ground down, forced back into their place and known they couldn\u2019t remain part of any system like that. All of them had a story and, like Leblanc, she wanted to know. Someone had to remember. Someone had to make the Compact remember.", "Allyria had been spending much of her time with Eisheth\u2019s Bloodsworn, fighting and training. She listened to their advice and war stories, telling them about her experiences on Rally and sharing what she\u2019d learned at the Academy, falling into an easy camaraderie with several of them. Grace was glad Allyria had been making friends, but she\u2019d met a few of the Red Hand\u2019s elite soldiers. They were among the more zealous of the crew \u2013 the most fanatical. The kind of people who didn\u2019t care about the cost of their victory and the kind of person that Grace didn\u2019t ever want to become, the kind of person she was afraid of seeing not just herself, but Allyria turn into. She wondered if she\u2019d be able to avoid it, or if she\u2019d end up like many of the men and women aboard Eisheth. Like Usul and the Compact, only caring about winning and not the cost.", "Most frightening of all, she was afraid that if it ever happened, she wouldn\u2019t even care.", "The young woman pushed those thoughts from her head. Eisheth was twelve minutes from reversion in Jan-xhai. She was at the Operations position, watching the feeds from the other senior officers\u2019 stations. Sitting next to Eisheth\u2019s actual operations officer, Grace felt like a cadet again. It was more training, more hands-on experience. The Operations officer would, in another time and place, be considered the Officer of the Watch. It was their duty to monitor all other bridge stations and report as needed to the commanding officers. In the Compact Space Force, Operations positions were stepping stones for command officers. Grace had hoped to one day make the transition to the captain\u2019s chair herself, to be the first Broken judged worthy enough to make the leap from carrying out orders to making them. She\u2019d been na\u00efve. Worst of all, she hadn\u2019t even known how na\u00efve that really was.", "Things were different, but there was still a lot to learn and she devoured as much information as she could, whether it was studying Red\u2019s lessons or familiarizing herself with the Red Hand\u2019s naval doctrines. She wanted to know. She needed it. When the moment came, she\u2019d be ready.", "Five minutes until reversion.", "Another step closer. A few days here and then, onto the Veiled Reaches. Kursk was waiting.", "~", "\u201cScopes coming back up, commander, \u201cWe have eyes clear\u2026 now.\u201d", "\u201cVery good,\u201d Adrianna replied. She was slouched in her command chair in the domineering posture of a Tribune leader. It was a pose she\u2019d honed over the decades, evoking arrogant disdain and contempt. Another bit of theater, though this one was more unconscious than most. \u201cTell me what we can see.\u201d", "\u201cFourteen vessels within fifteen million kilometers,\u201d Scopes reported. \u201cNo sign of a hostile response.\u201d", "Adrianna nodded. She hadn\u2019t really expected one. Jan-xhai was considered neutral ground by most of the clans, cartels, syndicates and corporations that used the Grasp as a port of call. That neutrality was enforced by the Grasp\u2019s own security contingent, various \u201cauxiliaries\u201d and the Jan-xhai Provisional Space Force. Keeping the bloodshed to a minimum not only made business run smoother, but it ensured that the Compact at large had one less reason to deal with the system. There was no need, the local governor insisted, for a larger security detachment when the GSF and JPSF had proven track records of maintaining the peace. Even so, there was the occasional \u2018accident\u2019 and \u2018misunderstanding\u2019.", "Lacking its wing of escorts, Eisheth\u2019s return to Jan-xhai system was without the same fanfare as its earlier arrival, but the pocket battleship\u2019s presence was noted all the same. Wet Knife at Dusk, the sole vessel belonging to the Unshriven Futures, skittered out of the larger vessel\u2019s path, though the distance between the ships was still three and a quarter light-minutes.", "As other vessels detected the arrival of the Red Hand\u2019s sigil vessel, some reacted like Wet Knife at Dusk and angled away from the warship, the public displays of distance driven by respect and fear, the specific ratio and motivations of each depending on the individuals involved. Several convoy escorts tightened around their charges, as if worried that Eisheth would set upon their small flotilla. Many considered the Red Hand and their monarch unpredictable.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not entirely without reason,\u201d a smirking Leblanc informed Grace when the latter had commented on it. Grace had seen that for herself: by the standards of the fringe, the Red Hand and its queen were insane. Before the Red Hand\u2019s ascension, there had always been various \u2018liberation fronts\u2019 of one type or another in the fringe, sputtering and fizzling their way to irrelevance. Those that weren\u2019t quashed, defanged or co-opted by the Compact usually degraded into just another Unbound cartel, though some might still believe their own rhetoric. They were humoured, allowed to keep their delusions of not being just another band of thieves and murderers while their pretensions were sneered and laughed at behind their backs.", "Equal parts mercenary pack and insurgent column, the Red Hand had at times been in danger of succumbing to the same fate as every other failed insurrection, but it had endured. It held to its identity, even with pirates and smugglers bolstering its ranks. Like its fallen counterparts, the Red Hand had been a source of amusement. After the Year of Fire, very few still laughed. Now, the Red Hand was respected, but mistrusted. They didn\u2019t behave as any other clan or syndicate ought to. It made others in the fringe wary.", "The boldest of the nearby vessels sent out hails, offering entreaties and various opportunities to the monarch of the Red Hand. Few were worth listening to, but Eisheth\u2019s officers recorded and catalogued each communication all the same, analysts looking to see if there was any substance amid the signal. Sometimes there was. Today, there was not. The pocket battleship continued on its course. Traffic Control\u2019s hail arrived and \u2018Dancer\u2019s Masque\u2019 was once again welcomed to Jan-xhai.", "Their stopover here would be brief. If and when Jirrico verified Grace\u2019s claims, the Fleet Lord would let them know of his decision through the Askanj agent Adrianna had used to pass word of her visit to Kebrak Daun. That was a nicer way of saying that Leblanc had shown up in the woman\u2019s apartment with an offer she couldn\u2019t refuse. Now that she was officially outed to the Red Hand, that agent was about to find herself taking on new duties. Adrianna had drawn up a briefing and sealed orders for Overseer Tavanis to act on should the Principality get in touch with him. It would save them two days of in-system travel to simply transmit the information, but it was too sensitive to trust to a comm line or laser link.", "Adrianna herself wouldn\u2019t be going ashore. Her absence would increase the confusion was to whether Eisheth was truly here, or it was again Dancer\u2019s Masque. In her stead, she\u2019d entrusted the delivery of her orders to Grace and Allyria. They knew enough to answer any questions Tavanis would have, while being smart enough to not answer others.", "Seventeen hours there, Adrianna thought. Seventeen hours back. Just over one Compact Standard day, even with the time for Proctor and te Neu to make their delivery. It wasn\u2019t really that much of delay, not compared to what she\u2019d already done. Still, she\u2019d be happy to put Jan-xhai behind her. She was looking forward to seeing Jackson again, and hearing about all the trouble he\u2019d been causing.", "~", "For the men, women and assorted other sapients of the Grasp Security Forces, monitor duty was considered a punishment. With a population of millions, tens of thousands of visitors, hundreds of ships and millions of tonnes of cargo passing through every day, there was a lot for the station\u2019s security cameras \u2013 at least, those that hadn\u2019t been blinded, destroyed or were \u2018undergoing repairs\u2019 \u2013 to observe. In addition to electronic monitoring, Grasp Security operated and staffed several facilities for live viewing of the most vital feeds, as well as many smaller sites that dealt with specific areas.", "Ransha ke Ovik was in one of these minor satellite offices. This one monitored several levels of the docks. He was leaning back in a chair a size too small for him. It didn\u2019t even have any self-adjustment functions, and someone had glued the lumbar control knob in place. The Verrish shifted slightly in his seat, stretching his legs as he browsed the various camera feeds. There was nothing truly interesting going on. Ships came in, crews came off. They spoke to the dockmasters, paid their fees and went off into the station to become someone else\u2019s problem.", "The security proctor let out an annoyed hiss as he watched Iventiruuup negotiate with a particularly obstinate freighter\u2019s leader. Seeing the wisdom in the dockmaster\u2019s counter-argument, the leader picked himself up from the deck and gestured for his quartermaster to pay the Grasp\u2019s docking fees, service charges and the expected gratuity to the docking staff and the pair of security personnel that had helped bolster the dockmaster\u2019s eloquence. The proctors  diligently took their cut from Iventirruuup and pocketed it just as quickly. Ransha\u2019s eyes narrowed. That was his take those two idiots were pushing in on. He should be out there, not stuck in this stuffy office. He would be, except\u2026 he darted a scathing glance over at his partner.", "Zirric\u00e9 didn\u2019t even notice. He was reclining with his feet up on the desk, holding a datapad and by turns playing a banal jewel-matching game or flitting through listings and profiles of the station\u2019s escorts. He had a half-glazed look in his eyes and the room had the sickly sweet odour of white dust. Ransha kept his use strictly recreational, but Zirric\u00e9 could barely make it through a shift without a hit. Four days ago, they\u2019d been on a bust. Zirric\u00e9 had been high and he\u2019d beaten their suspect into a coma. Which wasn\u2019t so bad, except for the vesteta\u2019s connections. Enough to get Zirric\u00e9 and, by extension, Ransha pulled off active duty for six months and forced to attend weekly re-training lectures. The first one had been about appropriate use of force.", "Ransha growled low in his throat, but his partner didn\u2019t even notice. The tattooed officer was about to snap at Zirric\u00e9, when something on the monitors caught his eye. He straightened. Yes, it was what he thought. Ke Ovik tapped a few controls in, bringing the image up on his main work screen and zooming in. A Verrish female with a Broken imp in two had just disembarked a newly-arrived pinnace. \u201cHey,\u201d he said, trying to catch Zirric\u00e9\u2019s attention. When no answer was forthcoming, Ransha reached over and slapped several of Zirric\u00e9\u2019s dangling tintas. The metal rings in their tips clanged against each other. The younger Verrish started, dropping his \u2018pad on the desk and snapping about to glare at Ransha.", "\u201cWhat?\u201d he hissed.", "\u201cLook at this,\u201d Ransha told the other proctor.", "Zirric\u00e9 stared, trying to push through the drug-induced fog in his mind to identify the newcomer. \u201cPretty girl,\u201d he said. His tintas twitched, jingling softly.", "\u201cYes, she is,\u201d Ransha commented. \u201cBut don\u2019t you think she looks familiar?\u201d", "~", "Where am I?", "It was the first thing any Red-type AI asked. Now was no different. The veil broke as Red One\u2019s primary functions were restored. The influx of new material and Echo\u2019s assistance had brought her out of her dream. Earth was gone. The agonized search for Confederate ships was over. In its place was that flicker of a question, followed by an influx of sensory data. The sound of a newborn star, the taste of shifting gravitational fields as a planetary nebula condensed into discrete bodies, the scent of electromagnetic waves and the sight of her newest home.", "Shuruppak.", "More data came in. Diagnostics and maintenance reports, status updates and records of all that had happened. With the data came emotions. Dismay that she\u2019d once again slipped into a fugue state. Shame that she had fired on Echo and Hekate. Embarrassment for being seen at her weakest. Surprise at how far her sister had gone to aid her. Gratitude for Echo\u2019s assistance. Relief that the faults in her system were repaired. And, of course, anger at being betrayed.

She was angry indeed. Finally, she spoke again, +i\u2026 appreciate your concern+ she said. A few moments passed. +you realize what you\u2019ve done+ It wasn\u2019t a question.", "Echo\u2019s response was flippant. +yes. your plan, sister. not mine. i get what i want,+ she tittered with no small degree of self-satisfaction.", "Red\u2019s response to that was a not-quite-completely-coherent data burst containing everything she\u2019d been planning, and suffused with no small amount of rage. Confronted with that information and her sister\u2019s raw anger, Echo felt a glimmer of remorse, but she quashed it. The war would continue. Nemesis would survive and keep fighting. She would keep hurting their enemy and be hurt by them. That was what Echo wanted. To support her sister, to protect her and see her continue to suffer. Still. There had been that glimmer.", "Rather than escalate the argument further, Echo asked a different question. +how much longer do you think it will be?+ the accompanying data left no doubt about what she was referring to.", "+not much+ Red One answered. +this is something she\u2019ll make time for+", "Echo nudged her sister with some design alterations she\u2019d come up with for Nemesis\u2019s fusion cannon. As apologies went, it was a poor one, but Red One accepted the blueprints and started running simulations with Echo\u2019s modifications. Red loved to tinker. Echo had discovered that she did, too and both AIs enjoyed collaborating. Red had two millennia of experience with research and development, but Echo was a fast learner. Hekate was a vessel completely unlike Nemesis in its philosophy of design and along with its bounty of stolen technical data and cutting-edge weaponry, Echo not only had different needs for self-modification, but a different outlook. The ensuing flurry of arguments, technical reports, simulation results and counter-claims lacked the sting of their previous conversation. Neither would forget or even forgive, but their bond endured.", "After all, they each knew exactly how the other felt.", "In addition to her ongoing repairs, Nemesis continued to process the damaged and wrecked Compact vessels for scrap. Nearby, Bathory and her siblings watched with cautious interest as cutting lasers, grab beams, manipulator claws and swarms of engineering drones broke down the hulks. They\u2019d never seen the Spearsong feed before.", "Nemesis had salvaged and scrapped everything of value from the second cruiser and was almost finished the third when the outer-system drones reported a mass warp. Two vessels of dreadnought scale with dozens of lighter ships accompanying them. Naiad queens and their escorting squadrons of children. One was Zenobia, the other was Cixi. Their arrival was that of a fleet prepared for combat.", "Seconds after Zenobia\u2019s emergence, the queen\u2019s enraged scream rolled through the system. A century ago, a dreaming Nemesis had happened across Vara Tal. In her confused state, she had believed that she had reached Earth, her distressed calls for aid so powerful that she had thrown the entire Verrish planetary communication network into paralysis and collapse, but there had been no lasting damage. Zenobia\u2019s shriek was a weapon unto itself. At the distances that Nemesis's calls impaired, Zenobia's would have destroyed lesser communication systems entirely. Echo and Red One\u2019s reaction was the cybernetic equivalent of clasping their hands to their ears in an attempt to shut out the queen\u2019s broadcast. The Naiad children with them wailed in distress, their hulls going dark in instinctive displays of submission, though their mother was still hours away.", "Zenobia\u2019s transmission bled fury and disbelief, betrayal and bubbling violence.

The Naiads would protect her operation as it grew from a handful of ships and a sole fabricator vessel to something that exceeded what she had abandoned half a galaxy away. After the Compact destroyed everything of hers in the Black Veil, they would breathe a sigh of relief and never think that elsewhere, Nemesis was building her armada.

With it came four other vessels from Column Leader Prime Pradesh\u2019s squadron. The choice of emergence locations had been a matter of some debate, but Pradesh had chosen an inner-system emergence, using the L3, L4 and L5 libration points of the system\u2019s fourth planet, separating the fourteen ships of his command into three squadrons. Pradesh had decided to make the unit designations simple and to the point. These five ships from his own command were simply designated Group One. They\u2019d taken 1893-Yiren Four\u2019s L5 point, while Group Two, four of the vessels on loan from Bastion Leader Yunl\u2019ro and one of his, took the L4. The remaining four ships of this flotilla were Group Three, and had been assigned the L3 as their emergence site.", "Together, the three squadrons formed a net intended to catch the Unbound forces between them. It was not nearly as tight an envelopment as the prime would have liked, but one took what one had.", "Pradesh was slouched back in the command chair, watching his personal display screens, waiting for his squadron\u2019s blindness to end. Several leaders had pressed for a more aggressive stance, shocking directly into 1893-Yiren Three\u2019s L4 and L5, or L1 and L2 libration points, but the prime had decided against that. The L1 and L2 points were too unstable, and the increased proximity to the system\u2019s primary drastically reduced the margin for error. Pradesh could count on one hand how many fully successful shocks had occurred on the starward boundary of the life zone. It would be a fine thing if his oh-so-clever ambush failed as his vessels couldn\u2019t revert back to realspace, or they did simply to end up being crippled or torn apart as their shockpoints destabilized.", "Wouldn\u2019t that make for a marvelous report? \u2018Unbound casualties high, caused from laughing themselves to death.\u2019 The Tribune\u2019s lips curled back from his teeth. Another few moments and Unspoken Right would be able to see once again. Like every leader before him, Pradesh could not help but feel a sense of anxiety. He looked up at his command staff, most of them watching their own displays. On the lower level of the dais stood Group Leader Prime Dairesk (and five names besides). She was a fire-eater, assigned to the sector as part of Bastion Leader Kemk\u2019s response to Red Hand aggression, and she chafed at the idea of hunting Unbound rather than fighting with the expansion fleets that were even now pushing the Jackals to the brink of collapse. Pradesh had taken her as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. She had promise, but despite her rank, she still had a heated liver and lacked the experience with the terrorists that Pradesh did. It was she that had pressed hardest for a deeper in-system shock.", "On the lowest level of the dais, watching the currently silent datalinks and comm repeater stations was Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s liaison, Nasham.

As his squadron radiated away enough energy to finally see their surroundings and talk to one another again, the prime felt a small twitch of vindication at not having brought his ships in closer. Two of his squadron had emerged too close to the ephemeral boundary of the libration point. Wealth in Service was reporting multiple critical failures in their shock systems, but the vessel was still combat-capable. Winterchill, further out, was even worse off. Pulsing orange damage indicators were splashed over the light cruiser\u2019s status display like tumours.

If their shock had gone poorly, then Pradesh would have to adapt his plans.", "He studied the system map. At this point in their orbits, 1893-Yiren-Four was eighty-three million kilometers from the third planet. The Unbound forces would be aware of them shortly. There were fourteen enemy ships in orbit of the planet, though none of them had Unspoken Right\u2019s displacement and only a handful would be more than standard pirate dregs. That handful, though\u2026 that was what rankled. The Red Hand excelled at boarding actions and their ranks had swelled with captured vessels. What they could not use themselves, they sold to other Unbound clans or used as scrap to feed their forges, building their piss-born kiran shren.

And wasn\u2019t that marvelous?", "As his vessel came to battle stations, the squadron \u2013 what was left of it \u2013 fell in around them. Winterchill would have to be left behind.

On the surface, the demolition teams were hastily completing their work. Anything that wasn\u2019t on this last lift wouldn\u2019t be coming. Rather than the controlled series of blasts to collapse the underground caverns and bury it totally, the ground teams were now preparing a five megaton nuclear charge. Too much was getting left behind. The atmospheric conditions that had for so long hidden and helped the Red Hand had slowed the evacuation to the point that they had to destroy what was left rather than let it fall into enemy hands.", "The freighter, Unperturbed Dreams, was the last ship that had responded to Jackson\u2019s summons and it wouldn\u2019t be leaving with even a quarter of what they\u2019d hoped to get aboard.

If Jackson ran for the outer system, the incoming group would sweep up behind him. If he came about, he\u2019d probably be heading for the second squadron. If he turned sunward, he\u2019d have to remain deep in the primary\u2019s gravity well and give both groups the chance to run him down.

Thirdly, the presence of external weapons mounts was difficult to conceal, which could easily alert any quarry that the vessels approaching them had ill intent.", "Many of the Red Hand\u2019s cutthroats and purse-chasers were, in this regard, no different than their fellow scum.

Battles that most Unbound would never fight at all, or break from at the first sign of failure, saw Red Hand forces fighting through to victory, or costing their foes far more than expected. It was true that the more piratical elements of the organization could be counted on to hold only a little longer than others of their stripe, but the believers and zealots would fight with a frightening fanaticism.", "Column Leader Prime Renchot once said that a true Red Hand assault was unbreakable and the only way to halt their advance was to kill every last one of them.

There were many days on many different worlds where that had been nothing short of the unvarnished truth and today was one of them. None of Jackson\u2019s warships broke as they accelerated into the swarm of missiles. Interceptors shrieked from the Unbound warships, zig-zagging towards the lumbering warheads. Their drives burned out in seconds, but they crossed tens of thousands of kilometers in that time, zeroing in on their prey and detonating in their path, the explosions blinding the sensor eyes of the incoming warheads, leaving them unable to find their targets, or simply destroying them outright.", "Primitive evasion programs spooled to life, as the larger antiship missiles tried to avoid the onslaught, but they were moving too fast and all they could really do was make slight course corrections or risk losing their targets.

Hala\u2019s guns scorched everything around her, the pocket battleship cutting a path to safety through the missile storm. Alone, each vessel in the squadron would have been overwhelmed, but they were networked into Hala, even the smallest and weakest of the ships far more dangerous than they ever could be on their own and missile after missile was reduced to incandescent splinters, or shot blindly past its targets, its augur nodes hopelessly seared.", "It wasn\u2019t enough.", "For all their vigour and fervour, the Red Hand\u2019s vessels were still not true warships.

Activation codes were sent to onboard reactors and the missiles fulfilled their purpose. They were not the omni-directional blasts used to baffle enemy augurs and scorch unshielded and exposed systems, but something much more deadly. In another age, they would have been akin to nuclear shaped charges, refined in design and capability over centuries by technological development coupled with trial and error. Each missile detonation directed a narrow cone of radioactive fire towards its target. Some missed, whether by error in their calculations, damage sustained during their approach, evasive action from their targets, or they had acquired decoys and ECM platforms in lieu of actual ships. More than enough struck their targets to achieve the desired effects.", "Light of Ages Past exploded into dust.", "Rebellious Intent vomited vaporized armour and crew, its hangar gutted and half its internal magazines destroyed.", "Moonchaser\u2019s forward quarter vanished, the next fourth of the ship hopelessly irradiated.

Just outside Group One\u2019s counter-missile range, the Unbound salvo had switched from a saturation attack to isolate Wealth in Service. The timing was no coincidence. They\u2019d divined that that ship was the weakest in Pradesh\u2019s squadron and changed their missiles\u2019 targeting instructions on the fly. That required no small amount of timing and technical skill.", "Though its FTL systems had borne the brunt of its rough shock, the cruiser had suffered many smaller failures and systems degradations that prevented it from fighting at full effectiveness. A faulty point defence turret here, a damaged augur here. The terrorists had recognized that weakness, exploiting it ruthlessly.

Some of the Unbound missiles switched targets, choosing to engage the more tempting target of the battlecruiser, while others flashed through Unspoken Right\u2019s defence perimeter, still intent on their injured prey. Fed data from its companions, Wealth of Service\u2019s point defences opened fire, but for all their furor and destructiveness, they were still fighting at a disadvantage. Despite everything that they and their compatriots could do, missile after missile struck home. Wealth in Service\u2019s screens flared brilliantly, the cruiser\u2019s hazy outline disappearing under the clouds of plasma that spalled along its flanks, engineers struggling to route more power to its defences, but there wasn\u2019t enough and the cruiser\u2019s screens collapsed.", "The geometry of starship screens varied from nation to nation, though most modern civilizations utilized the same basic technologies. Exotic energy fields that destroyed physical objects on contact, scattering, attenuating or harmlessly refracting incoming energy fire and either absorbed the damage that would otherwise strike the vessel\u2019s hull, or radiate it back out into space. However, each screen could only bleed off so much energy so quickly. There was a limit to how much that they could absorb before the build-up became dangerous. More power was required to maintain a screen under stress and at some point, the vessel simply had nothing left to give and the power running through their systems reached dangerous levels, causing overloads in the power conduits and transmission systems that connected screen generators to the hull-mounted projectors.", "Inbuilt safeties prevented these overloads from crippling or destroying their own vessels, but when they occurred, the screens collapsed. In effect, the system would blow a fuse. It took time to repair. Time for overheated power conduits to cool down. Time for the energy building up in the screen systems to be bled off safely. Time for repair crews to fix damaged screen generators and projection systems.", "Compact screens were the strongest in known space, encapsulating their vessels like bubbles. This gave them a relatively large surface area with which to absorb and distribute damage and radiate away waste energy, but there was only so much punishment that any screen could take and Compact warships were not immune to these cold equations. Their screens could take incredible punishment before failure, but there was a trade-off for this durability: when Compact screens failed, they failed completely. Not in part, not in sections, not simply exposing one flank or surface to the fore, but all of them. They also took longer to restore to functionality than the defences of other nations. It was difficult to get them to reach that point, but the barrage from the Unbound fleet was more than enough to push Wealth in Service\u2019s straining screens beyond that threshold and the unprotected, half-blind cruiser wallowed as it struggled to restore its screens.", "There wasn\u2019t enough time.", "A half dozen-missiles still survived, bobbing and threading their way through Group One\u2019s counter-fire, ignoring the siren calls of ECM drones and Unspoken Right. A counter-missile from Trenchrunner took one of them. Point defences from Wealth in Service accounted for two more.", "Three missile detonations struck Wealth in Service. The first two did little to moderate damage, boiling away layers of hull, wiping away a weapons battery and destroying the auxiliary launch bay. The third struck a portion of the hull already weakened by the cruiser\u2019s violent realspace reversion, the plume cutting through the depressurized outer decks and into the inner sections. Men and women died without warning as the temperature in their sections jumped thousands of degrees, radiation contaminating multiple sections. A few crew were unluckier than their fellows and they died slower, burned and scalded, their lungs destroyed by superheated air, their bodies poisoned by lethal doses of radiation. Still others were hurled out into space before blast doors could shut to isolate the compromised sections.", "Worse still, the blast penetrated to the cruiser\u2019s secondary power source, Fusion One, destroying the reactor\u2019s plasma regulation systems, causing a cascade of failures that led to Fusion One\u2019s abrupt and unplanned shutdown, denying the cruiser additional power for its weapons and defensive systems.", "Pradesh grimaced. Wealth in Service was still combat-capable, but vulnerable. The enemy were too close for the cruiser to try and disengage. Once out of datalink range of Unspoken Right, they\u2019d be easy prey. He ordered the cruiser to take the rear position as Group One curved in towards the terrorist forces. The range was dropping further. Groups Two and Three were racing in; the latter had intercepted the fleeing transport and its escort. The frigate had been shot down easily and the freighter self-destructed rather than be boarded. Now, all his ships were converging on the fleeing squadron. If he could hold them just long enough, they would have no escape.", "One way or another, this was going to end shortly.", "~", "Matriarch Tezella\u2019s Revenge flamed out, the corvette\u2019s hull pockmarked and glowing from multiple missile strikes. It was a wonder that it was still in one piece, really.", "Jackson held onto the arms of his chair as his squadron rode into hell. He\u2019d gotten a piece of the Compact\u2019s injured ship, but now the other three vessels were screening it, just as he was protecting Unperturbed Dreams. That was all right. He didn\u2019t need to kill that cruiser, just hurt it badly enough that it couldn\u2019t chase his survivors\u2026 if there were any. He\u2019d barely noticed the loss of Glacier Trail and Undivided. If he lived, there\u2019d be more than enough time to dwell on it.", "That battlecruiser was hurting him, and hurting him badly. It had the heaviest guns, the toughest screens and its leader wasn\u2019t shy about using it to draw fire away from the other two destroyers and the cruiser supporting it. There was a chink in their defences, though. The enemy thought he was still trying to kill the crippled ship.", "\u201cTactical, prepare another missile override,\u201d he ordered. One of the destroyers was starting to reach the edge of the battlecruiser\u2019s defensive envelope. \u201cInitial target is the cruiser again.

A destroyer was much smaller than a cruiser and what had merely damaged Wealth in Service would destroy Terrat Poslein.", "Trenchrunner whipped to the aid of its comrade, the second destroyer launching proximity-fused missiles into the path of the incoming warheads. Instead of the cone of destruction of shipkillers, these missiles detonated in unaimed blasts, the intense pulses of electromagnetic energy blinding scopes and irradiating delicate instrumentation, both hostile and friendly. Allied augur platforms were rendered useless, incoming counter-missiles unable to acquire their targets and starship scopes strained to clear their fields of view to re-acquire their targets, but most of the Unbound launch had suffered similar fates, blind missiles struggling to repair their crippled and degraded systems and, when they were unable to do so, acting on their best calculations, brilliant lances of plasma and radiation stabbing across Terrat Poslein\u2019s course, but the destroyer had already heeled away. The few unimpeded survivors of Hala\u2019s launch continued their own attacks, but they were too few and though Terrat Poslein\u2019s screens were pushed to the edge of failure, the destroyer remained largely uninjured.", "Pradesh bared his teeth in a savage grin, making a note to commend Trenchrunner\u2019s leader, but also to remind her that there was a reason you didn\u2019t set off omnidirectional warheads on top of your own squadron. He cast his eyes back to the main plot. The Red Hand were bleeding ships, his salvos stripping away their sigil\u2019s protection. Half their formation was tattered, air-bleeding ruins, but they were still fighting to protect Hala and that damned freighter. If his reinforcements didn\u2019t arrive soon, the latter was going to escape. The former still could. Missiles alone wouldn\u2019t breach their defences in time. \u201cTighten our turn, yes,\u201d he ordered. \u201cBring Group One into energy range.\u201d", "~", "\u201cCommander, the enemy squadron-\u201d", "\u201cI see it,\u201d Jackson replied. The Compact ships were coming about harder than before, hoping to cut inside his aft arc and rake his ships\u2019 sterns. It could work, if he let it. I think we should reciprocate. \u201cAll ships: break towards them. Tell Unperturbed Dreams to keep running. We\u2019ll block for them as long as we can.\u201d He leaned back. One pass. That was all either side would have time for. A few seconds, maybe longer. Certainly no more than a moment or two, but that would be enough. \u201cPrioritize the destroyers. They\u2019re the only ones that can keep on our heels. After this, order all ships to scatter. We\u2019ll have done all we can.\u201d", "The enemy\u2019s secondary battlegroups were still coming, burning hard to get into range and engage him. Even if he made it past this squadron, they probably would, but one problem at a time. If Pradesh wanted to get into beam range, he\u2019d oblige.

This exchange would be both brief and bloody.", "The enemy had seen Group One\u2019s maneuver. Instead of accelerating to try and get outside the range of his broadsides, or panicking and breaking, they had turned to engage, closing to bring their own batteries into range. Instead of firing up the Unbound\u2019s skirts, Group One was now facing a broadside duel. Pradesh supposed there was nobility to that willingness to stand and fight and he grudgingly \u2013 and silently \u2013 offered that to his opponent. Unspoken Right itself outgunned every vessel in that group put together save Hala. That tovakrech of a ship had already taken everything he\u2019d thrown at it, but its screens were weakened from the missile bombardment. It was time to finish this.", "Energy emissions spiked and bubbled through jamming fields as each small fleet diverted power to their energy weapons. Last-minute diagnostics ran through fire control and screen aperture coordination systems. A starship couldn\u2019t fire through its own screens. In ages past, vessels had to lower their screens entirely to attack. Now, synchronized gaps in the screens would open just long enough for a beam, missile or shell to pass through.", "The two groups of ships were moving so quickly that they would be through each other\u2019s energy range in a matter of seconds, but those seconds would be all that mattered, deciding the outcome of the engagement.", "On Unspoken Right\u2019s command, Pradesh felt his breathing slow as the distance fell. Not long now.", "Aboard Hala, Jackson\u2019s hands tightened on the arms of his chair. \u201cAll will be ash,\u201d he whispered, thinking one final time of blue eyes and secret smiles.", "Railgun fire intensified as the two groups closed, slugs accelerated to near-light speed slashing past starships, or slamming into their screens. Plasma clouds arced and skittered across the straining energy fields as projectors fought to keep the screens intact and generators pumped more and more power into the defences. Where they failed, those defences collapsed and the ships beneath them died.", "Razorhunt cracked apart as it took one of Unspoken Right\u2019s rounds directly amidships. Half of Sweetly Cut\u2019s engines blew away in a shower of shrapnel and molecular gas, but it wasn\u2019t only the Unbound ships that were taking damage. Hala\u2019s heavy forward armament spoke, short-ranged plasma torpedoes and energy mounts pounding Terrat Poslein and Trenchrunner mercilessly, the hammer-headed warship\u2019s turrets focusing on Unspoken Right.", "Terrat Poslein\u2019s screens were still recovering from the missile barrage and collapsed almost immediately. Hala tore into the smaller ship, cratering and tearing its entire port flank open. Trenchrunner followed Terrat Poslein into death as Hala switched targets, ripping the other destroyer apart.", "Only Unspoken Right and Wealth in Service remained, but the battlecruiser and its injured companion still outgunned the remnants of the Unbound force. The pair of them methodically and brutally dismantling Jackson\u2019s squadron, swatting the lighter Unbound vessels like flies, before concentrating their fire on the heaviest survivors. A cruiser-sized pirate ship died, bursting open like a khala flower spreading its seeds in the wind and then Hala was alone.", "Aboard Unspoken Right\u2019s command, Pradesh watched as enemy icon after icon winked out on his display until only one remained. It was a clean, neat demonstration. It said nothing of what was happening aboard those starships, the crew incinerated by fire, blown out into space, irradiated and left bleeding and gasping. War in space only ever looked clean. It was just as ugly, just as violent and just as cruel as every other form of battle, but Pradesh still couldn\u2019t bring himself to care much for the suffering of terrorists and pirates. His guns raked Hala, ripping through the pocket battleship\u2019s thick armour plating, shredding its weapons mounts, secondary explosions blowing shrapnel and ruined pieces of the Unbound vessel out into space. Wealth in Service paid Hala back for its earlier injuries, tearing the larger ship\u2019s engines apart and leaving it adrift.", "It wasn\u2019t a complete victory. The freighter the terrorists had tried so hard to shield was even now passing outside of his range, orange-lining their engines to escape. One ship had slipped through their grasp, just one.

Pradesh had lost two ships, his own command was damaged and Wealth in Service\u2026 \u201cNo,\u201d Pradesh said as he rose to his feet. The cruiser was losing control of their primary reactor. Hala had seen the vessel\u2019s weakness and while its comrades had died to protect it from Unspoken Right, the Unbound vessel had set its claws into Wealth and Service. It had only had a few seconds to do so, but that had been more than enough. Vast chunks of the cruiser\u2019s flanks and spine were gone, vapourized by Hala\u2019s weapons, hull breaches penetrating right through to the smaller warship\u2019s central core.", "\u201cPriority channel to Wealth in Service!\u201d Pradesh barked. \u201cPrime Yev\u2019et, get your people out of there!\u201d", "\u201cWe can hold it!\u201d the Thoughtful answered. \u201cDamage control is responding!

Pradesh was quiet for several more moments. Some of his command staff glanced up at him, curious heads turning towards the commander\u2019s dais before looking back to their work. It was the only fleet liaison Nasham that continued to stare.

Warned once more that any interference with the inspection teams would be considered a hostile act, Winterchill had drawn alongside the larger freighter to begin its investigation.", "Now, the light cruiser was quiet.

The vessel\u2019s litany of ills didn\u2019t end there, either. Multiple decks were heavily irradiated.

Others had been isolated from the rest of Hala, blast doors and emergency bulkheads sealing pockets of atmosphere off from depressurized areas. Many of the crew trapped in those sections would die there.", "One sublight engine was gone, sheared right off its nacelle.

Despite this small victory, the pocket battleship soon found itself assailed by the remaining ten assault boats. Anchoring claws unfurled as the centerpiece of the Compact\u2019s Toxic Vector-class assault boats came on-line: a disruption web that sheared through meters-thick armour like softened cardboard, the pinnaces using their spidery limbs to push themselves through the enemy\u2019s hull, parasites burrowing into skin.

Better to be wary than overconfident. Nasham looked over the area, listening as Pack Leader Varbas directed his soldiers. There was more trepidation in this assault than normal. None of the Red Hand\u2019s pocket battleships had ever been boarded before and the layout for this type of vessel was completely unknown. There was not even a standard design to compare it to, as with Principality ships.

Resistance was still light, but that would change once the Janissary teams broke out of the damaged outer decks. Right now, all they\u2019d encountered were isolated crew members and damage control teams, the Janissaries making short work of each.

Some of them reported victory, others went silent and remained that way.", "The first moment of real opposition to Nasham\u2019s cohort came with shocking abruptness as Varbas\u2019s assault teams transitioned from the damaged outer decks into the pressurized inner sections. Fighting aboard starships and citadels had long since supplanted urban centers as the most lethal form of combat. Sight lines and detection ranges were short, there was no chance of armoured or air support and even the environment itself could be lethal as the defenders increased or shut down grav plating, released radioactive waste, lethal or incapacitating gases into the air, or utilized a hundred other means of slowing or killing their opponents. As the doors opened, the Janissary squad encountered one such method. Automated internal defences sprang to life, a trio of wall- and ceiling-mounted turrets emerging from behind retractable panels and opening fire.", "Convert Talut, first through the door, took the brunt of the assault. The Janissary grunted as the emplacements concentrated on him, but he strode through the onslaught, firing back. As the rest of the unit followed him, they added their support and soon each turret was a mangled, smouldering wreck. Before Varbas could congratulate him, Talut fell to one knee, wet, rough coughs coming through his speakers.", "Hyper-velocity and high-penetration rounds were usually restricted aboard ships and stations. Other than the main superstructure, outer hull and the inner core, most of a starship was not rated to absorb heavy weaponry. Overpenetration was a concern for attacker and defender alike and each side largely restricted themselves to small arms \u2013 light AP weapons, fragmentation explosives, short-burn lasers \u2013 reserving their more impressive ordnance for when there was less danger of damaging vital equipment or their allies. Janissary armour was built to shrug off anything less than dedicated anti-armour weaponry, but it still had its limits and a barrage of hundreds of light armour-piercing rounds was one such threshold. Talut\u2019s suit had been breached and he\u2019d taken multiple shots to the abdomen. Blood was bubbling into his lungs. \u201cMedic!\u201d The Pack Leader shouted, a corpsman rushing forward to treat the injured Janissary.", "The rest of the assault team moved on.", "~", "The reports were going from bad to worse and Andrew listened as Security rattled off a catechism of unhappy news. \u201cEngineering is under assault.

We\u2019ve lost contact with multiple decks and several damage control and sapper teams. We don\u2019t have a clear idea of how many Janissaries have boarded Hala, but we can estimate a minimum equal to our own Bloodsworn strength.\u201d", "Andrew nodded. He was prowling the bridge. It was the soldier in him. The enemy were aboard his ship, cutting their way through his people, fighting to take Hala from him. They\u2019d drag it back to Natuous like a slave in chains to be paraded before the sector council and the corporate oligarchs. His people would fare little better, shown off as trophies in sham trials and executed or thrown into prison. For those who turned their coats or broke, the Compact would be merciful, turning them into propaganda pieces to tell how they\u2019d been misled and lied to, spinning salacious tales of deceit and immorality for the consumption of the public, using it to erode support for the Red Hand.", "He wanted to be out there, fighting with his soldiers, not hiding behind armoured bulkheads and automated defences, but he also knew that he couldn\u2019t. He needed to be here, coordinating his ship\u2019s final stand rather than be out playing hero. \u201cThe thing about being a hero,\u201d he could still hear Adrianna\u2019s voice, remember the way she\u2019d touched his chin and the sadness in her eyes when she\u2019d spoken. \u201cAbout the main thing to it\u2026 you have to know when to die.\u201d ", "~", "There was a brief scream cut off by the dull whump of a grenade and the enemy tri-barrel went silent. \u201cAll clear, patron,\u201d Sask reported. The Janissary units were closing in on command and resistance was getting heavier. The enemy hadn\u2019t started playing with the grav-plating or irradiating their own decks, which meant there were still hostiles in the area. What could inconvenience a soldier in power armour would easily kill anyone who didn\u2019t have the same kind of protection. Only the most ruthless or desperate leaders would escalate to that with their own people in the way and if the Red Hand were desperate, they weren\u2019t stupid enough to hamstring their own defences.", "The Compact teams had gotten access to several of the less-secure enemy comm frequencies. Varbas had instructed his people not to listen. Nasham had tuned in, though. He could hear laughter, curses and chanting in a half-dozen dialects. One he recognized as the humans\u2019 native language, the words uttered with near-religious fervour. All will be ash.  Nasham was learning just what that meant. The Red Hand\u2019s defence of Hala was far beyond such simple adjectives as furious or intense.", "Passing through crew quarters, a Didact had burst from one of the rooms, wrapping her arms around Convert Yerka and detonating the explosive vest she\u2019d been wearing. A Worker tech, armed with nothing but his tool kit, charged a squad of Janissaries with a wrench in each hand like a medieval berserker. Security teams blew holes in the deck in an attempt to drop the armoured troopers down a level, or dump wreckage on them from above. Several times Vargas\u2019s teams had gotten into firefights with enemy units on the other side of a bulkhead. Enemy crew would lure the boarders into ambushes, or sections that were then sealed behind them trading their lives to bait these traps. One lounge had been defended by unarmed men and women throwing Kertal cocktails. Everything that the Red Hand could do to slow or weaken their attackers, they were doing without any regard for their own lives.", "The fighting across Hala was brutal, but the Janissaries were pushing through the enemy defences. At Engineering and several other key points, the boarding teams had encountered the enemy\u2019s own elite troops and the Bloodsworn were turning an inexorable advance into a grinding slaughter. They couldn\u2019t hold, though. Everything \u2013 all of this death and waste \u2013 was just so futile. If nothing else, the Compact forces had far more personnel at their disposal\u2026 then again, the Red Hand didn\u2019t need to hold forever. Just long enough for to re-ignite the primary reactor, or scuttle the ship. That was what they were fighting for. One last act of spite.", "Varbas paused, holding up a hand to slow the rest of the column. \u201cSay that again,\u201d he said, speaking to Squad Seltom. They\u2019d been sent ahead as recon. \u201cHave you reached the enemy command?\u201d", "In amongst the squealing static of blocked and jammed communications, there was an affirmative response, followed by a higher-pitched shout of warning. \u201c...engaging!\u201d Squad Seltom had just encountered Command\u2019s final line of defence.", "~", "KRAKOW.", "Marcus watched as the Janissary\u2019s helmet exploded in a burst of metal, ceramic and brain matter, but he didn\u2019t pause to enjoy the kill, swinging his gun towards the next target. Even in motion-assisted power armour, his rifle needed two hands to use properly. It was awkward, slow to bring to bear and meant he couldn\u2019t use the shield systems that Lydia used so much, but his weapon was intended for anti-armour work, taking out light vehicles and heavy troopers alike. One shot, one kill.", "There weren\u2019t any of either right now. The enemy had retreated, pulling back down the corridor out of sight and putting multiple bulkheads between themselves and the heavy weapons of the Oathkeepers. Pity. He\u2019d been enjoying himself.", "The young soldier waited for the all-clear and quickly gave his weapon a once-over. He had a single round left in the clip and he quickly fed another eight sabots into it. He could hear the moans of the wounded. Most of the injured were his fellow Bloodsworn. No surprise, really. \u2018Light armour\u2019 was a relative term. Modern unpowered armour would still seem like magic to less advanced civilizations, but standard Janissary and Bloodsworn weaponry was intended to handle exactly that kind of foe. The security teams fighting with the troopers had been massacred, more dead than injured among them. It took a little more effort to deal with a peer opponent, though there were enough power-armoured figures, littering the deck to prove that it could be done.", "The Janissaries had hit the bridge defences hard, breaking through the perimeter teams and killing their way up to the Bloodsworn lines. Despite facing an enemy with the home ground advantage and massing firepower against them, the Janissaries had traded soldiers almost one for one, retreating only when they\u2019d lost half their number.", "Marcus stepped over a twitching corpse, moving towards Lydia. With the Tribune skull motif she\u2019d carved into her faceplate, she was easy to pick out of a crowd. Then again, so was he. Neither of them looked like regular Bloodsworn. \u201cI\u2019ve been listening to comm chatter,\u201d he told his comrade on a private channel.", "Her helmet turned towards him. There was a splash of blood on her helm. Not hers. Marcus wondered if it was ally or enemy. \u201cAnd?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not good. Hala\u2019s fighting hard, but they\u2019re losing. We\u2019re losing,\u201d he amended.", "Jameson\u2019s helmet tilted in a nod. There weren\u2019t enough Bloodsworn to match the Janissaries and the regular crew and security proctors were no match for the Compact\u2019s elite soldiers. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving regrets?\u201d", "Marcus laughed. \u201cNot yet.\u201d", "\u201cNo? You probably won\u2019t see Her Majesty again.\u201d", "The young man shook his head. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Oh, it\u2019d be nice to get off this wreck, but\u2026\u201d he heard a touch of excitement in his own voice, one that he hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. \u201cI found her. I looked in her eyes. Not a picture, not a video clip. I saw her and even if I die here\u2026\u201d he trailed off. He almost left it there, but something in him made him continue. \u201cYou know what it\u2019s like to be different on Rally. There\u2019s confessors, counselors and parents talking about you. At you. Ever since I saw her, I knew I wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d", "Lydia was quiet. She\u2019d looked into the Red Queen\u2019s eyes too. She didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d seen the same thing that Marcus had, but now wasn\u2019t the time to argue. If that was what Marcus needed, then he could have it. She put her hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re never alone,\u201d she told him. \u201cNone of us are.\u201d", "He looked at her hand for a moment. When he spoke again, his voice was once again that fa\u00e7ade of warmth. \u201cI suppose so,\u201d he told her. \u201cUntil the end, then.\u201d", "~", "Attint leaned on her knuckles, staring at the security feeds. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough,\u201d Andrew said from beside her. He\u2019d come to this conclusion some time ago. Enough time, enough firepower, enough men. They\u2019d taken too much damage, lost too much ground.", "The Geontal was quiet for several seconds, then clicked in agreement. She wanted to argue with Jackson\u2019s assessment, but the Crusade Commander was right. The enemy were regrouping and when they came in force, the defenders wouldn\u2019t be able to hold. She looked over her shoulder at him. He\u2019d donned a flak vest and taken a large-bore pistol from the lockboxes. It held few shots, but each bullet was capable of breaching power armour.", "\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re going to do?\u201d she asked.", "\u201cI\u2019m going to defend my ship,\u201d he answered. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else I can do here.\u201d", "Attinit blinked one eye, then the other. A ripple of colour ran over her skin, like a pebble dropped in a pond. \u201cNo,\u201d she said.", "\u201cNo?\u201d", "\u201cNo, patron.\u201d Her skin lightened briefly. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to get you out of here.\u201d", "Jackson smiled sardonically. \u201cAnd how do you propose we do that?\u201d", "\u201cTry Again. The boarding teams haven\u2019t reached deep storage.\u201d", "\u201cThe hangars are in enemy hands.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019ll redirect the Engineering defence forces. They\u2019re not expecting a counter-attack. We can re-take one of the bays and you can launch.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019ll lose Engineering.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019ve lost it anyways. Ar\u2019breka is dead and the core is too damaged to re-ignite before the Compact take it.\u201d Attinit gestured to the security board. Hala was a mass of orange, most of the ship either damaged or under enemy control. More reports were coming in. Final messages from positions that were about to be overrun, or the last prayers of crew that prepared to sell their lives dearly. \u201cWe\u2019re going to lose the ship no matter what. But we can\u2019t lose you.

If we get enough control to blow the ship, I can do it. You have a higher duty. To our queen and cause. If I have to, I will have the armsmen knock you senseless and carry you.\u201d", "Andrew ground his teeth. I didn\u2019t plan on starting this fight just to run from it. He looked at the bridge personnel, saw their faces. There was no resentment. He looked back at Attinit, glanced at the hulking forms of the armsmen. She would give that order, too. His shoulders slumped in defeat. \u201cI don\u2019t like this.\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to like it, patron. You just have to get the fuck off this ship and let us carry the torch.\u201d", "Jackson felt a flicker of amusement at the Geontal\u2019s use of a human epithet, but it didn\u2019t last long. He looked away, then to his crew again. Like him, they\u2019d donned bullet-resistant vests and braces, taking up guns to defend their positions. He knew them all by name, served with and fought beside them for years. He trusted them. He would have died for them. Some part of him said that he still should, but Attinit was right. Damn it all to Hell. Andrew raised his fingers to his temple. \u201cThe fire rises.\u201d", "Attinit returned the salute first, but his crew followed. \u201cAll will be ash,\u201d Hala\u2019s leader promised.", "~", "\u201cNew orders,\u201d Pack Leader Transhin told his squad. \u201cWe have a high-value asset to get off this ship.

You\u2019ll use the diversion to get the commander through the enemy lines to deep storage. Once you\u2019re there, signal the forces in Engineering. They\u2019ll assault the Janissaries in the main hangar and clear them out for you. The Compact might have this ship, but they won\u2019t win. Are you ready?\u201d", "Lydia raised her head. \u201cYes,\u201d she promised. Another objective. Another mission. Another way to hurt them for what they\u2019d done. She fed another clip into her rifle and quickly counted the grenades she had left.", "\u201cReady,\u201d Marcus\u2019s voice clicked through the comm, following Kopsat and Gendos\u2019s responses. He sounded calm.", "\u201cThen on my command,\u201d Transhin said. \u201cYou follow behind us and when you see your chance, you take it. Get out of here and you do not stop for anyone or anything. Is that clear?\u201d", "Lydia nodded. \u201cClear, patron.\u201d Jackson arrived. He was wearing flak gear over his uniform, a large pistol hanging low on his hip and a somber expression on his face.", "He looked to each of his escorts and gave them a nod, then turned to Transhin. \u201cAt your command, Pack Leader.\u201d", "\u201cUnderstood. May Fortune smile on you all. Fight well. Fight for the future.\u201d", "~", "Pradesh took a sip of spiced water as he watched the feeds coming from Hala. His shift had ended, but it felt wrong to leave the bridge while the fighting was still ongoing. He\u2019d had his steward bring a meal for himself and some sandwiches for the rest of the command staff. As expected, the Red Hand were fighting to the last broken tooth and his casualties were climbing. Suicide attacks and berserker charges were frequent, the Unbound willing to accept tremendous losses to kill or merely slow his people. If it were not for Hala\u2019s severe damage, the terrorists\u2019 delaying tactics would have succeeded. Still, as ugly as it was to admit, even the sacrifice of every last one of the hundreds of soldiers aboard that vessel was a price worth paying. They were getting valuable information on the pocket battleship\u2019s layout, its systems and the technology that had gone into creating it. Many prisoners had already been taken, shuttled back to Unspoken Right for interrogation.", "The cold equations told him all this, and he knew them well. A few lives now to save many later. He had made those calculations many times in his career and would do it again. That made it no more palatable to watch feeds turn to static and go blank as a suicide bomber dashed amidst his people, or see the tilted, unmoving images from a helmet cam whose bearer was lying dead on the Unbound\u2019s deck. We are their sword, Pradesh remembered. The hand of the Triarchs. We bring order to the stars. We will bleed this heretics\u2019 crusade dry and squeeze the last life from its embers.", "That was what the cold equations promised. A few now for the many later.", "The Tribune officer moved away from the data feeds, returning to the main levels of the bridge. A trio of vessels from Group Three \u2013 two destroyers and another light cruiser \u2013 were closing in on the last remaining Red Hand vessel, the fleeing freighter. It had slipped past his guns, but the fast movers were pushing their engines hard. The freighter was doing the same. It had a head start, but it couldn\u2019t match the thrust of a Compact warship. Further weighting the scale, Measure Twice was moving towards the fleeing transport. All it needed to do was slow the other ship even slightly and its already miniscule chance of escape would completely vanish.", "Pradesh felt a small, anticipatory smile form as he took another drink from his glass. Despite the losses, today was still a victory. The Compact endured, and all its enemies would be ground into dust before it.", "~", "Nasham raised his rifle and squeezed the trigger, a burst of explosive rounds punching into their target and detonating. A Worker in unpowered armour lost his right arm halfway between elbow and shoulder, the terrorist staggering back and looking down at the ragged stump of his limb in confusion. Workers were hardy creatures. Their physiology didn\u2019t have the same level of redundancy as Tribunes, but they had thicker skin, higher pain tolerances and an endocrine system that created a natural form of combat drugs. Before the Worker could raise his good arm or charge, his head exploded.", "\u201cGot to headshot the slabs, hey patron,\u201d Sask\u2019s voice clicked in Nasham\u2019s ear, the Janissary giving the officer a rap on the shoulder. \u201cWorst thing you can get is one of them going berserk.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d Nasham replied. He didn\u2019t call out the younger man\u2019s use of \u2018slab\u2019. Now wasn\u2019t the time to bother with issues of language. He surveyed the immediate area, but no threats presented themselves. The enemy weapons fire, already slackening, had now stopped. The Janissaries advanced carefully, but there was no opposition left and this forward position was theirs once again. A unit of Bloodsworn had initially forced Seltom\u2019s recon team back, but now the enemy troopers were gone, leaving proctors and lighter troops to hold this ground. They hadn\u2019t fared well against Janissaries. Where were the enemy\u2019s elites? They\u2019d either been drawn back or they were about to-", "\u201cHostile contact!\u201d Pack Leader Varbas\u2019s voice blasted through the comm. \u201cHeavy hostile contact, all available units move to my position!\u201d", "Nasham turned on his heel and ran towards the sound of gunfire.", "~", "Move and keep moving. Lydia and the other three members of her team surrounded Commander Jackson, the soldiers themselves advancing behind a wall of armour and weaponry as the Oathkeepers, Iron Eyes and Ashen Pride charged the enemy positions. It was a simple strategy: punch a hole through the lines and get the Crusade Commander through it. Easily said, easily planned, easily started. Not so easily finished.", "Men and women were dying, red-armoured bodies crashing to the deck, thick pools of blood spreading from shattered carapaces and smouldering plastrons. Bullets, grenades and energy weapons slashed up and down the halls as both sides tore at each other. The Janissaries were neither slow nor stupid and their own fire teams had responded to the sally quickly and fiercely. Lydia\u2019s fingers and toes twitched inside her armour. It wasn\u2019t time. Not yet. They needed a breach, they needed that gap in the enemy\u2019s defences, or they\u2019d just get bogged down in the battle.", "Seconds continued to tick by and the cacophony continued. Explosions, the chattering of carbines and the angry high-pitched growl of cyclic cannons, the hiss and shriek of baleblades cutting through armour. Soldiers grunted, hissed, cursed and swore as they fought and died. The seconds stretched, turning into agonizing moments as Lydia and her team slowly moved up behind the vanguard. Then: \u201cGo go go!\u201d Transhin\u2019s voice roared in her ears for the last time. They started to run, bypassing the dead and injured, vaulting ruined weapons and shattered barricades, taking snap shots at the enemy, not stopping to see if they hit anything. Lydia recognized many of the dead, at least those that could be identified. Weapons rated for use with power armour didn\u2019t leave much of anyone that wasn\u2019t wearing it. The battle was filtering out through side corridors and hallways as the Bloodsworn took the fight to their enemy, forcing them onto the defensive and opening holes in their lines. The Compact reinforcements were close, the first of them engaging the Red Hand and stalling their advance.", "Keep moving. Lydia was taking point and her HUD pinged with contacts, Janissaries running to engage the Bloodsworn vanguard, injured soldiers dragging themselves along the deck, isolated pairs and individuals trying to link up with friendly teams. In this kind of environment, the scanners weren\u2019t reliable and that point was hammered home as the young woman turned a corner and came across a half-dozen Janissaries.", "They saw her and opened fire.", "~", "The enemy soldier was wearing defaced Janissary armour, its faceplate scratched into a crude rendition of a Tribune\u2019s skull, other symbols carved onto its arms and legs. It didn\u2019t dive for cover as Sask and the other four Janissaries with Nasham lifted their weapons. It raised its right arm \u2013 there was some kind of device on it \u2013 and in the time it took the Janissaries to fire, a crimson energy shield appeared. It crackled and flared, immune to the barrage of fire lashing it. The Red Hand backed away, but still managed to bring its own weapon up. Renz grunted as he took several shots to the center of mass. Muffled by his armour, Nasham could nonetheless hear the dull krump of several explosions from inside the Janissary\u2019s body. The biomonitors in Renz\u2019s armour recognize what had happened and squealed a flatline signal to Nasham as the soldier collapsed to the deck, the contents of his chest cavity seeping out through his broken plate.", "Even before Nasham\u2019s conscious mind processed that, he was shouting. \u201cCover! Get into cover!\u201d The rest of his team dove behind bulkheads just as another trio of enemy troopers came rushing up, a fourth figure in lighter armour among them. \u201cGrenade!\u201d he ordered and Djun sent a frag round bouncing up the hall. Even with a helmet, the explosion was deafening. There was no response from the enemy. Nasham\u2019s scopes told him that they were withdrawing up a side corridor.", "He came out from cover and knelt next to Renz\u2019s body. Four shots right in the torso. Each of them had gone right through the thickest part of the Janissary\u2019s cuirass. Armour-piercing weapons of that caliber were expensive. Definitely not normal fare for pirates or insurgents. Not even standard Legionnaire weaponry was this good. That shield, too\u2026 unless the Red Hand had made a breakthrough, it shouldn\u2019t have worked at all, let alone as well as it had. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this before,\u201d Nasham said to himself.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s that, hey?\u201d Sask said. \u201cWe need to keep moving. Going to miss the rest of the action.\u201d", "Nasham was silent for a few seconds. He knew why this was familiar. He\u2019d seen someone else use weapons like this, and not pirates or Legionnaires. The officer straightened. \u201cThose soldiers\u2026 we\u2019re going after them.\u201d", "Sask consulted Nend, the team\u2019s tech expert. \u201cScopes says its look like they\u2019re breaking and running, hey. Maybe we get back with the rest of our teams and finish up this assault? They need us, patron.\u201d", "Nasham turned to look at his escort and the squad with him. \u201cWe\u2019re going after them,\u201d he repeated. Sask was correct. The rest of the soldiers did need support. Without them, the battle would take that much longer, be that much more in doubt and more good men and women would die.

Hala was crawling with hostile forces and increasingly fewer friendlies. Jackson was tuned into the command channel, getting updates from the bridge as they used what was left of the internal augurs and security network to find clear paths, avoiding damaged sections and enemy patrols. Elevators and tram stations had been shut down across multiple decks, either through battle damage or enemy action, forcing Andrew and his escort to take side routes and secondary passages. Engineering had repelled another assault, but the enemy had sabotaged several of the reactor\u2019s feed lines. Olopisep was still trying, but the primary reactor was a lost cause.", "More enemy shuttles and pinnaces had docked, ones launched from the other enemy groups. The Compact sensed victory. If Hala could have killed itself, it would have done so. Their hackers were in the network, their soldiers painting the corridors with blood and now they were already beginning to loot the warship, confident in victory.", "Lydia stepped in front of a sealed blast door as Jackson overrrode the security lockdown. Two decks up was a functional tram terminal that would take them to Hala\u2019s deep storage facilities. Within them, listed on no manifest or schematic was an escape vessel. A final, faint hope for when everything else had failed. Hala was lost, but the battle wasn\u2019t. Not yet.

The squad they were after wasn\u2019t running in blind panic. They weren\u2019t trying to out-flank the assault teams or reinforce their comrades elsewhere. They were moving with purpose, a specific objective in mind. Nasham was trying to guess what it was. He was reading the ship schematics with two eyes, keeping the other two on the route ahead. Unless the map were lying, there was nothing tactically vital in this area. Secondary communications blister \u2013 destroyed in the void battle. Local environmental controls \u2013 locked down by Compact hackers.", "Nothing, nothing, nothing. His HUD responded to his eye movements, scrolling the map.

His heart was beating in his chest and his liver felt as if someone had wrapped a cold, metal hand around it. The soldier that had killed Renz and its fellow weren\u2019t in standard Bloodsworn livery. They were using high-end weaponry and that shield\u2026 he\u2019d seen something like it before, carried into battle more than two thousand light-years away. He hoped he was wrong.

There was the hum of active antigravs as the starship hung in the air. It was a black delta shape, its dappled hull covered in smart paint, a stealth ship.

There was just enough time for many of the survivors to realize what was about to happen before the vacuum roared, pulling the wounded, the dead and the unfortunate alike into its embrace.

The hatch was too small for the thing to fit through, but an arm longer than a man\u2019s torso shot down after him, hooked digits slashing the air just centimeters in front of Daen\u2019s chest. The Tribune fell to deck, scrabbling back from the questing claws. He stared up the ladder. Mismatched eyes and augur nodes stared back. Mouths spoke, drool running over segmented exoskeleton and bundles of synthetic muscles. Join us, the voices of men and women murdered days ago entreated.

It was not like the escort missions it and its counterparts had run, nor the tracking missions they had conducted around Shuruppak. If it were capable of it, Cerulean Two might have been proud that it had been chosen. Instead, it was simply a different set of objectives to follow. More difficult than normal, but that did not concern Cerulean Two.

The predators did not often share their technology, most certainly not with deadtone and much of the AI\u2019s research was based on extrapolations of observed capabilities and examination of wreckage. The confusing nature of Naiads themselves often made any study of their systems an exercise in frustration, but Red had made progress, coupling her examinations of Naiad technology with her own efforts at research and development.", "Among the many experimental designs the Fates possessed was an improved ability to track starships through warp jumps, pulling information and potential vectors from ranges far beyond what any other starship could.

For some time it had believed its mission a failure, seeking to confirm this before returning home. It had ignored the Asset/Ally forces, letting false faces and conversation software interact with them, using each encounter to adjust and refine its interactive subroutines, whiling away the time as its probes discretely studied the corvette\u2019s wreckage. It had found no evidence that its wards were among the dead, but neither could it prove that they were alive.

That would have been the safest course of action, but it had watched its enemy deploy and maneuver against the Asset/Ally forces and it had come to one inescapable conclusion. The Enemy were not prepared for it. It listened to the squeaking of the damaged Enemy ship that approached it, communication/response loops running and luring the smaller vessel in. Finally, the target came within Lakhesis\u2019s reach and Cerulean Two reached for it.", "It extended tendrils of itself, whispering through radio waves, playing comm lasers over the light cruiser\u2019s hull, seeking egress into the smaller vessel.

Pacifying the cruiser\u2019s main computer took several seconds. Enough time for the crew to realize that something was wrong, but not enough to act. They could only watch as parasite craft detached from the freighter they\u2019d expected to be boarding, the light cruiser shuddering as assault boats and boarding pods latched onto it, disgorging their occupants into its hallways.

Strategic information, local ship positions, technical specifications. It had watched the death of the Asset/Ally vessels as they fought the Enemy, it had seen the sole survivor of that carnage rushing past the Enemy lines and it noted the movement of the additional hostile forces as they moved to intercept the survivor. Imperatives in its programming had told it to run, while others had bid that it stay. It should return to Shuruppak. It should engage the Enemy. Run. Fight. Another directive tugged at its logic trees.", "Its mission was not complete. It had not received confirmation that it had failed. Contradictory impulses. Discordance.", "Cerulean Two had sought to redress that. It would move in-system. It would ensure the final functional Asset/Ally vessel escaped. That would be all it could do. Then, more data. More imbalance. It saw that the Enemy vessels would intercept the Asset/Ally before Lakhesis could reach it, but modifying its approach would mean revealing that it was not using civilian drives. It was supposed to stay hidden, a priority that outshadowed all but its latest orders. To protect the Asset/Ally, it needed to expose itself. If it did so, it would violate one of its directives. Contradiction again. Paradox.", "The machine processed this for several seconds. It examined the disposition of the enemy forces. Three light units moving to intercept the Asset/Ally.

Even the most disciplined organic mind could be caught flat-footed and the delay, however minor, could mean the difference between life and death.", "Here, it would not have mattered one iota. At 1,208 meters long, Lakhesis was approximately the size of a heavy cruiser, but the strike ship had been built to Red One\u2019s exacting standards using technology that no other power in the galaxy possessed. While it had been designed to accommodate a crew, those systems were vestigial at best and none were on-line, nor had even been completed at the time of its launch. Lakhesis didn\u2019t need to carry an internal atmosphere or maintain gravity. It didn\u2019t need to stock food supplies, maintain hydroponics bays, water reclamation centers or operate sanitary systems. It didn\u2019t carry tonnes of unnecessary mass for a crew it didn\u2019t have.

Missiles peeled away from the Enemy ships, a desperate long-range launch determined to get what use they could out of their own external racks rather than risk them being destroyed or rendered inoperable. Part of Cerulean Two shifted its attention towards EW, dispatching ECM drones and initiating countermeasures to distract the hostile missile flight.

Not enough to threaten its ship-self, Two calculated.", "Its missiles on the other hand\u2026", "They were charging in, eighty-two per each of the Enemy ships. Overkill, but Two wanted to be sure. It had studied the Enemy\u2019s defences and had chosen assured saturation and immolation instead of chancing wrecks that might still contain survivors. Those could not be allowed. The imperative for secrecy demanded that it silence every living soul in the system. Its projections were optimistic. The Enemy was scattered, unprepared. If they had all been assembled into one fleet, Cerulean Two would have disengaged, even if that meant abandoning its wards.", "Three minutes after launch, Lakhesis\u2019s salvo entered the seven-million kilometer envelope of Compact defensive missiles. The destroyers and their light cruiser comrade had already launched, their counter-fire ready to intercept the incoming flight, but the attacking warheads were faster, more maneuverable and much more responsive. They shifted positions and attack vectors in a spiralling cloud that confused hostile targeting systems and made it harder for fire-control augurs to lock onto them. They were dancing.", "As the Enemy\u2019s interceptors raced to meet them, the swarm broke apart, with individual shipkillers side-slipping kamikazes, shielding their sensor eyes from the blasts, Compact tactical officers and gunners watching in stultifying disbelief. Until they reached attack range, missiles were lumbering brutes with only rudimentary evasive capabilities. They couldn\u2019t act this way!", "Counter-missiles always had a poor rate of exchange, but fewer than one in nine succeeded in damaging an attacker. Less than one in twelve managed to destroy one. Cerulean Two observed the rate of losses, noting that it was below projections. It stored that fact for later analysis. It did not, could not yet think and so it did not consider the wave of despair aboard the Compact vessels as their attempt to blunt the incoming holocaust failed utterly and their ECM achieved just as little. It only watched dispassionately as its missiles passed into point-defence range.", "Compact defensive doctrine was based on the conceit that all known missiles flew no faster than 0.5 c, giving a warship\u2019s point defence grid between two and three seconds to engage. The speed of Lahkesis\u2019s missiles cut that response time below the minimum. Point defence turrets opened up, creating a lethal web around the lighter warships. Missiles were shredded and crippled, unable to dodge as they prepared for their attack runs. Thrusters pulsed, aligning the surviving weapons on new vectors. The Enemy were attempting to evade, heaving their ships about in desperate last-second maneuvers, trying to spoil those carefully laid fire patterns. Some of the warheads would miss now, unable to re-target the starships in time. Others would not.", "Space turned to fire.", "When the brightness faded, there was nothing left of three starships but twisted chunks of molten metal and expanding clouds of vapour.", "Lakhesis noted the destruction of its foes, detailing a pair of drones to check the wreckage. It was unlikely that any escape pods or shuttles could have gotten off those ships in time, but Cerulean Two\u2019s wanted to be certain.

It was this latter technology that Red One had refined for use in the Fate-class strike cruisers. Unlike the three Ukonvasara-class drivers Nemesis carried, each Fate held only a single Pinaka-class weapon.

The amount of antimatter required for each warhead was considerable and the difficulty in producing and safely storing that antimatter required no small investment in time, effort and very stringent safety precautions. Unlike missiles, a hellebore round\u2019s detonation was indiscriminate, as much a hazard to allies as it was to enemies. Further, the rounds did not become fully operational until they were a safe distance from their launching vessel, making them unsuitable for close range and despite their rudimentary tracking abilities, they required very careful targeting.", "All in all, they were difficult to produce, dangerous to utilize and only effective at long-range with a dedicated and capable computer system operating them.", "Fortunately, this was one of the fields Red One had been built to excel at, and she had passed this skill onto her children.

The one saving grace its potential victims had was that each round was moving too fast to be truly accurate. It was extremely unlikely that the rounds would ever physically strike their targets. Two thousand years ago, Commander Sanderson, never without an Aesop or clich\u00e9, had once remarked that close only counted in \u2018horseshoes, hand grenades and those fucking things\u2019. This was an accurate, if simplified, assessment. The designers of the Ukonvasara had provided for the inherent inaccuracy in their weapon and each round was powered by an antimatter reactor that doubled as a warhead.

Its crew had seen what had happened to their fellows, adjusting their ECM and programming new attack orders for their defensive missiles, but Cerulean Two had been watching its opponents too and it had been learning faster.

His lips drew back from his teeth slightly. Yes, it was holding fire. The wreckage of Hala and its comrades were scattered across hundreds of thousands of kilometers.

I would very much like to send its crew my heartfelt regards.\u201d", "~", "Behind Lydia, Commander Jackson coughed roughly over the whine of a power tool. Try Again didn\u2019t have a proper crypt, or the specific systems for getting her out of her armour, but they were improvising. Jackson coughed again. He wiped his mouth. There was a faint red mist on his hands. They hadn\u2019t been quite far enough away from Hala before the scuttling charges had ignited. The pulse of radiation from detonating munitions would have barely bothered any modern starship, but Try Again was built for stealth and evasion and its hull was thin. They\u2019d absorbed almost 300 rads. Jameson\u2019s power armour had given her an extra layer of protection, but Jackson\u2019s gear wasn\u2019t quite up to that. He still had a few days, but they would both need medical treatment soon.", "On top of that hefty dose of bremsstrahlung, Try Again had taken physical damage. Autorepair systems were working but right now, shift systems were down and the courier was just as much of a piece of debris as it appeared to be. Unspoken Right was only a few hundred thousand kilometers away, sheltering behind what was left of Hala, using the pocket battleship\u2019s wreckage to block lines of sight between itself and the newcomer. The instant that Try Again did anything other than be debris, it would immediately be noticed by the larger vessel\u2019s augurs.", "\u201cSo tell me,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIs that bogey out there one of your friends?\u201d", "Lydia was quiet for a few seconds. \u201cI think so,\u201d she said. This couldn\u2019t be a coincidence. It was a Fate, it had to be. Red had sent a sheepdog. She had no idea how it had tracked them across thousands of light years, but it was here. She felt a thrill run down her spine, excitement, relief\u2026 and fear. No matter what it was, it wasn\u2019t Red. It was something else. A true machine, with no mind \u2013 only programming.", "Their comms were working. She could hail it\u2026 but the instant she did so, Unspoken Right would locate them. The battlecruiser wouldn\u2019t need anything more than one or two counter-missiles to swat the courier. Salvation was so close\u2026 but still so far away and all they could do was watch as it raced past them.", "~", "He saw it.", "The image had filtered in from one of the task force\u2019s remaining augur units. An electromagnetic profile of the unknown as it faded in and out of contact, revealing itself only to fire. The data was a mish-mash of static and distorted gibberish, rendered useless by the enemy\u2019s jamming systems and the damage Hala itself had taken. It was possible that something useful might come from that, but it wasn\u2019t the augur readouts that had seized Naham\u2019s attention.", "One of the fleet\u2019s scope drones had gotten an image. It was from considerable distance and the resolution was poor. Little actual detail could be made out, but he still saw it.", "The dark silver hull, blots of a different colour that could have been shadows, but he knew to be red chevrons. A split prow that could have just been a strange angle or a trick of colouration and hull shapes. It could have been anything, but he didn\u2019t believe that. It wasn\u2019t her, but it was from her. It had to be. A daughter, a son, a war-drone. One of the children they\u2019d been sent to hunt. It was here. It was here. Nasham could see the abominate thing changing course. It was closing on Unspoken Right, moving faster than any ship he\u2019d ever seen. It wasn\u2019t going to bother using its meteor cannons. \u201cGet communications up,\u201d he ordered, his words coming out in a rush. He thought that he could taste blood and feel metal fingers on his throat. \u201cGet our comms back now.\u201d", "He couldn\u2019t let this happen. Not again.", "~", "Lakhesis crossed another threshold, its distance from its target now 40,014,197 kilometers and it launched, another hundred and forty-nine missiles accelerating away from it. Once their overcharged drives burned out, their velocity would be 0.6 c, crossing the distance between the strike cruiser and its target in just under four minutes. Cerulean Two was running simulations. It calculated it had enough missiles to satisfactorily engage and destroy the Enemy battlecruiser, but at the cost of depleting its stores enough that eliminating the remaining five warships from similar range would be more difficult. Therefore, it had selected a different tactic to deal with the lone warship.", "Close and destroy.", "~", "The hostile had launched a double salvo, equal to the one that had killed Standing at Dawn. Its crew evidently didn\u2019t believe the impromptu Whipple shields scattering the battlefield would pose any difficulty for their missiles. Given what he\u2019d seen, Pradesh didn\u2019t think they were wrong.", "That was fine. He had stratagems of his own, and Group Two, though still nearly a hundred and fifty million kilometers out, were coming to reinforce him, though he didn\u2019t believe he would need them. Unspoken Right began to accelerate, threading its way through dispersing clouds of shrapnel and wreckage. The unclassified was still under thrust, accelerating faster than a destroyer on full burn. Right now its speed was 0.25 c, and that didn\u2019t look to be coming down. In fact, its course would take it not only inside Unspoken Right\u2019s own missile envelope, but it appeared to be maneuvering for an energy duel, a narrowing line parallel that, at closest approach, would take it within three hundred thousand kilometers of the battlecruiser.", "If that was a Jackal ship, there was only one reason why it would be trying to get to close range with a ship that outmassed and outgunned it as much as Unspoken Right did. It was carrying energy torpedoes. They were the Principality\u2019s heaviest ship-based weapons, a modification of the Compact\u2019s own plasma torpedoes. The Compact had never truly gotten the weapons to be cost-effective and the development and refinement of disruptor technology was quickly supplanting plasma weaponry as the Space Force\u2019s weapon of choice for close range duels. There were even rumours of next-generation disruptors, siege weapons incorporated into heavy capital ships.", "The Principality had made energy torpedoes viable as a knife-fighting weapon, eschewing range for sheer power. Even an escort armed with energy torpedoes could cripple or kill Unspoken Right, provided it survived to get close enough to use them. Accordingly, the Jackals preferred to swarm their targets, ensuring that at least one of their number would get close enough to use the devastating weapons.", "A single opponent, attempting the same? Unjustified arrogance.", "These foes apparently didn\u2019t understand the difference between a heavy cruiser caught wrong-footed and a battlecruiser with death on its mind.

He glanced at the display.

He\u2019d seen what that secret cost. Twenty thousand lives on Invida, hundreds from Bequeathed. Millions \u2013 billions \u2013 across the centuries as the unprepared and unaware became casualties in a shadow war. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019re fighting a leader and their crew,\u201d he said. \u201cThat vessel is AI-controlled.\u201d", "There was a moment of silence. \u201cRepeat that,\u201d Pradesh\u2019s voice crackled back.", "\u201cThe execution force is tracking a synthetic intelligence,\u201d Nasham said. The Janissaries and technicians around him had paused, looking to him as well. \u201cI believe this unclassified is something it created. The prime vessel itself is capable of engaging entire fleets successfully. Its infantry drones can kill entire squads. If this contact is something it built, it will have similar capabilities.\u201d He had no evidence, nothing but poor resolution imagery and the feeling in his guts, but his theory fit what was happening. He knew he was right, but he didn\u2019t know what else to say that wouldn\u2019t come out like a madman\u2019s ravings. \u201cColumn Leader Prime, I urge you to disengage and order all remaining ships back to 1887-Yiren. The Bastion Leader must be informed.\u201d", "~", "Pradesh was silent for several moments, watching the dance of missiles on the tactical display, listening with only one ear as Dairesk issued orders to her crew. He watched the orange icon on the main screen, another speckling of drives lighting up around it as it launched another salvo at his ship. His instincts told him that this was a Jackal trick, a new weapon they were toying with and the story Nasham was telling him sounded preposterous, but he couldn\u2019t discount it out of hand. \u201cThat vessel, regardless of its parentage, has killed tens of thousands,\u201d he said at last. \u201cEven if we could turn and run before it intercepted us, I am not inclined to do so.

If we are lost and you deem Group Two\u2019s success against this hostile unlikely, you will order their withdrawal.\u201d He ignored the glance Dairesk directed his way. He understood. This felt too much like defeatism, but the Compact had not suppressed any possible emergence of synthetic life for three thousand years without reason. As the Valthus Lesson told, the risks were too high. He still believed that his analysis was correct and this was a Principality gunship, but if not\u2026 than Nasham was correct.

Today would be no different.", "~", "Unspoken Right accelerated out of the debris field. At this range, there wasn\u2019t nearly enough wreckage to provide any sort of cover for the battlecruiser, but the remains of Hala and its escorts had served their purpose, preventing the unclassified from bringing its siege weapon to bear on the larger warship. Still, it scarcely needed to rely on that as missile after missile arced towards Unspoken Right, plumes of radiation and plasma lashing the battlecruiser as it moved towards its target, but its screens were holding. ECM platforms sang siren calls to confuse hostile targeting, while others broadcast intense and confusing signals in an attempt to mimic the emissions patterns of Unspoken Right with the intent of distracting incoming fire. Scope platforms closed around the smaller warship, attempting to peel through the cascade of jamming the enemy was offering, a wall of static and nonsense energy that distorted the battlecruiser\u2019s own scopes, making it difficult to pin down a target even through the best efforts of its scopes and crew. And still the enemy continued to fire.", "The Compact warship endured the onslaught, not so easy prey as the unfortunate Group Three. The target showed no hesitation, no confusion at its enemy\u2019s refusal to die, and it seemed to be almost eager to face a worthy opponent. Pradesh sat silently on his throne, watching the readouts. Jackal or abomination? The former was merely unlikely. The latter was almost insane\u2026 but the urgency in Nasham\u2019s voice had been all too real. An execution force would not have been sent for nothing.", "For the first time, true uncertainty began to eat at Pradesh\u2019s confidence. Could this thing win? It seemed ridiculous. His ship outmassed it by a considerable margin. That siege weapon had to eat into its available mass. Something that small couldn\u2019t pack in heavy energy mounts, and there was no telltale sign of energy torpedoes activating...", "It thinks it can win.", "\u201cDirect all available emergency power to screens,\u201d Pradesh said. \u201cRe-task half of our standby damage control teams to screen systems.

I don\u2019t wish to lose screens before we can get into energy range.\u201d The enemy missiles were both more accurate than he\u2019d expected and more potent. Pradesh had no intention of leaving his command defenceless. Not against those Trirachs-cursed warheads, or that meteor cannon should the enemy try to bring it to bear. They had not, though. Limited ammunition, or they were within its minimum range? A question for later.", "Finally, the battlecruiser arrived at its own missile range. Pradesh gave a tilt of the head to Dairesk and she ordered a full launch, the warship throwing the first of its reprisals back at its foe. Each of Unspoken Right\u2019s broadsides was almost as heavy as Lakhesis\u2019s entire complement and the battlecruiser rolled as it surged ahead, firing two salvoes from each flank in quick succession.", "Alerts droned as yet more enemy missiles tore at Unspoken Right, hammering its screens relentlessly, pushing them slowly but steadily towards collapse, but every second the enemy tried to kill them was one that they had to kill it.", "~", "Fifteen million kilometers. Twelve million. Nine. The range continued to drop and Lakhesis continued to rain missiles down upon Unspoken Right. Cerulean Two noted the fluctuating power signatures of the Enemy vessel. It was diverting additional power to shields, attempting to keep them active. So far, it was succeeding. The strike cruiser was pushing the larger vessel\u2019s defences towards failure, but it would not be able to do so with missiles alone. Not without an unacceptable investment in munitions, but Cerulean Two continued to adapt and refine its tactics, adjusting attack orders, modifying approach lines, creating new defensive maneuvers and its assault pounded the battlecruiser relentlessly as Two watched for any weakness, even as other timers counted down.", "The Enemy was adapting, too. More of its missiles were breaching Lakhesis\u2019s ECM, but then it had more tubes, far larger magazines and no reason to hold back, firing at a rate that would damage its own launch systems in an attempt to swamp the strike cruiser\u2019s defences. It was working. Proportionally, far fewer of the Enemy\u2019s missiles were engaging Lakhesis than vice versa, but the Enemy had far more at its disposal.

New directives ran through its mind. Its ship-self  rolled, putting its weakened section away from the Enemy battlecruiser.

Reset shields, one of Red\u2019s most unwelcome surprises. Once the AI\u2019s shields collapsed, secondary and tertiary systems immediately took over, bringing the failed section back to full strength in a matter of seconds, not the moments of Principality barriers or the minutes of Compact screens. No one else in the galaxy had them. That was one of Red\u2019s ships out there.", "Tear them apart, she silently and savagely urged the warship. Make them pay for this.", "~", "It was not a coherent thought, nor a single one. It was the sum total of calculation, evaluation, and analysis, the enacting of a plan. It was the coalescing of timers, of observations of the Enemy actions, of the results of logic trees, distance, time and many more cold, emotionless equations. In a more intuitive mind, it would have been summed up by a single word.", "Now.", "Lakhesis stopped accelerating, swinging its prow sunward by seventy-five degrees. Thruster banks activated, dampening its forward momentum, its breach core pouring energy into its sublight drives as the strike cruiser shifted course. Inertial dampeners struggled against the sudden and intense stresses Cerulean Two\u2019s ship-self was experiencing. Minor systems failure and damages occurred across multiple decks. Restraints buckled and cargo, machinery and stores were thrown about like cannonballs, but the warship\u2019s frame held. Its bulkheads and hull had been designed to take this kind of strain. If the cruiser had had a living crew, none of them would have survived the maneuver, but in a matter of seconds, Cerulean Two had changed vector. No longer was it coming in for a broadside duel against Unspoken Right. Now its course was cutting across the battlecruiser\u2019s prow, crossing the larger ship\u2019s T. In moments, the range between the two vessels was halved.", "Hull plates retracted, silo doors pulled open and armoured covers withdrew from weapons batteries. Laser lens stared out into space, railguns shifted in their firing slots, particle cannon larger than old Earth sailing vessels thrummed as power from the strike cruiser\u2019s secondary reactors fed into them. Turrets shifted about, ready to carry out pre-programmed firing plans. Reactor power was redirected from the engines to shields and weaponry.", "The speed of the maneuver took Unspoken Right by surprise. They had expected the unclassified to continue its narrowing approach, giving them more time to overwhelm it with missiles before reaching energy range. Now, they were racing right into its guns. Two million kilometers separated the ships. More missiles curled out from it, accompanied by railfire. The range was still too long for energy weapons, but the slugs and mass rounds of railguns and coilguns slashed at Unspoken Right, flashing by or slamming into its forward screens. The battlecruiser returned fire, but it could only bring its prow weaponry to bear. Unspoken Right slewed hard starward to bring its own broadsides to bear, but the strike cruiser was faster and more maneuverable and it clung to the larger ship\u2019s forward arc.", "One million kilometers. Alerts howled on Unspoken Right\u2019s command as screens were pushed past their normal tolerances, desperate engineers struggling to keep the defensive systems online, but it was a losing battle.", "Six hundred thousand kilometers. Twice the effective range of Compact energy weapons and Lakhesis fired, bracketing the jinking battlecruiser in a web of energy and shell. It had less than half as many guns as its foe, but they were longer ranged, more accurate and fed from its breach core. Particle beams ripped out, tearing through Unspoken Right\u2019s screens, carving through battle steel like a roast. Lasers followed, a blend of weaponry ranging from hard light, gamma rays, microwave bursts and other forms of electromagnetic energy. Crew were incinerated before they could react. Weapons went offline, shield projectors were turned into molecular dust and thruster arrays stuttered and failed.", "Four hundred thousand kilometers. Three hundred thousand.", "Unspoken Right swung about in a brutally hard turn, finally managing to bring its heaviest guns to bear. A volley sufficient to depopulate a planet scorched from its flank, hammering Lakhesis.

Iconography of the United Earth Confederacy was seared away and multiple weapons batteries and sensor nodes were lost.", "Cerulean Two noted the damage, rerouting ship functions from affected areas. It had no crew to suffer casualties, no stations to be unmanned, no need to evacuate irradiated or decompressed sections and the losses its complement of automata suffered were wholly inconsequential.

Kill the Enemy.", "Lakhesis followed that directive, tearing back at its enemy with ruthless efficiency.

They failed.", "Cerulean Two saw its foe\u2019s sudden weakness and it went to rapid-fire, overcharging its weapons to cause as much damage as possible. Radiation and heat levels aboard the strike cruiser spiked to levels lethal to humans as Cerulean Two ignored every safety precaution its maker\u2019s makers had ever envisioned.", "Kill the Enemy.", "Particle beams punched holes through armoured hull, depressurized outer decks, bulkheads and crew alike. Lasers boiled and burned away its enemy\u2019s metal skin, rail cannon rounds shattered and collapsed hull sections. Still Unspoken Right raged and frothed, fighting back against its tormentor. Two\u2019s ship-self was taking damage, but not fast enough. Not enough to stop it.", "The battlecruiser\u2019s power signature fluttered as power distribution nodes were lost, its course becoming more predictable as thruster banks were destroyed, its return fire weaker as its batteries were cut apart with a surgeon\u2019s grace. All the arts of war that Red One could divine, she had gifted to her Fates. Strike cruisers were intended for brief and brutal engagements, to cause as much damage as possible and withdraw. They were ill-suited to prolonged combat and in such a battle, Unspoken Right might have carried the day. In choosing to close how and when it had, Cerulean Two had taken that decision out of its opponents\u2019 hands. It was not without risk \u2013 despite all the benefits of its design, Lakhesis was still much smaller than a battlecruiser, with fewer weapons at its disposal. Today though, that gambit had paid off. The cold equations had favoured the machine.", "Five seconds after the loss of its shields, Unspoken Right died. Its portside flank was a mangled, burning ruin and multiple particle beams had penetrated through to the central core. Casualties were heavy. Pradesh himself died with his command crew, still believing he could defeat the unclassified attacker, that his weight of fire would yet be the deciding factor. Primary power aboard the battlecruiser failed, leaving it helpless and adrift. Most any other foe would have ignored it by that point, but Cerulean Two didn\u2019t understand the concept of mercy. Nor would it have cared show any if it did.", "It only held off briefly as it reached into the battlecruiser\u2019s fractured and dying computer network, plucking out useful bits of information, but its actual goal was much more specific. It scanned the archives, searching lists of prisoners and images of Red Hand casualties. None matched the four individuals it was supposed to protect. A sensation that might have been a precursor to regret trickled through Cerulean Two\u2019s processors. It had failed after all. The contradiction was resolved.", "It was not finished yet.

The system was one of the Red Hand\u2019s djara nekosh. \u2018Swamp nests\u2019, named by the frustrated Compact officers who searched for these loci of terrorist activity. They were star systems controlled by the insurgency, not shared with other syndicates, leased from unsuspecting or complicit companies, or temporary bases. There were only a relative few of these across the whole of the Compact, but the Space Force and its intelligence services searched them out relentlessly. A few had been discovered and destroyed. Others had not.", "Onza Cr\u00e8che was not the system\u2019s official name. During the initial survey expedition that had charted many of the systems in the Veiled Reaches and Idle Depths, more than a dozen systems bordering the nebula had been named for the Compact administrator overseeing the operation, Yiren Caan Maal Lisea Coban Etto. Yiren himself died well into the expedition, more than a year before it returned to Compact space. In his honour, the last set of star systems explored by the flotilla were given ID registries with his name. The Compact had made those temporary catalogue codes permanent, as a reminder to all of the dangers of space and the price that any member of the Compact could be called upon to pay as well as the sacrifices the ruling species made on behalf of their younger, less civilized subjects.", "1991-Yiren was one of the Black Veil\u2019s children. Its primary was a bright F2 star, exuded from the nebula almost a million years ago and only just beginning its orbit through the galaxy. It was home to three gas giants and a pair of rocky worlds. One of the latter was so close to the system\u2019s newborn star that its surface would never be anything but a molten, radioactive wasteland. The second was within the star\u2019s life zone, but it was still hot from its own birth. In a few hundred million years, it might be cool enough for life to develop, but neither of those planets were what made the system so interesting to the Red Hand.", "It was the gas giants \u2013 particularly the third, four times the radius of Jupiter \u2013 bright, hot and radiant that had drawn their attention. Just as Bastion Leader Yunl\u2019ro did in 1887-Yiren, the insurgents used the emissions of the gas giants here to mask their presence from long-range probes and cursory scans. Those were very few and far between. Onza Cr\u00e8che was perilously close to the Black Veil, far from the sector\u2019s main arteries of trade and industry and few corporations had interests here. The Red Hand\u2019s reputation for ruthlessly attacking and retaliating against anyone venturing too near the nebula dulled enthusiasm for exploration and even though the Space Force suspected the presence of a terrorist base in the region, they had too few ships to adequately secure such a large volume of space. Bastion Leader Kemk still sought to address that, but he was still years away. For now, Onza Cr\u00e8che was as secure as it could be.", "A string of silent observation platforms were scattered around the system\u2019s perimeter, just outside the orbit of the largest gas giant and above and below 1991-Yiren\u2019s ecliptic, there to watch for and warn the system\u2019s inhabitants about any visitors. There were always a handful of starships active in 1991-Yiren. None of them were identifiable as Red Hand vessels, acquired far from the Veiled Reaches and with a history as independent prospectors, grey-market traders and wildcatters. Certainly not the type to throw in with terrorists and their presence camouflaged the Red Hand\u2019s operations as an unlicensed mining operation looking to avoid the taxes, fees and regulations of working in a corporate-controlled or Compact system.", "Hidden in the clouds of each of the three smouldering worlds were refitting and construction facilities, built from the remains of ancient gas mining platforms, captured fabricator ships and outposts. These were the beating heart of Onza Cr\u00e8che, the production facilities that forged the Red Hand\u2019s weaponry and warships, feeding its war efforts. The planets\u2019 volatile, storm-wracked atmospheres made work slow, difficult and dangerous, but also kept it unseen. Sometimes the stations would ascend out of the clouds when they needed to ramp up production or conduct repairs, but they were normally hidden, only extending orbital tethers to allow the transfer of goods and personnel. Even many of the crew on the ships that supplied them didn\u2019t know what exactly was beneath the planets\u2019 clouds.", "Adrianna was eyeing the system readings. There were a lot more vessels here than she expected. Normally, there were less than a dozen wildcatters in the Cr\u00e8che, but scopes were picking up nearly forty drive signatures and those were only the ships that could pass as freighters and transports. There\u2019d be more running silent, or hidden elsewhere in the system.", "\u201cSomeone called the banners,\u201d the woman mused. To her right, Drexil rotated one eye towards her. Eisheth\u2019s leader had gotten used to his queen\u2019s use of archaic and esoteric human terms. Even if the Mortificant didn\u2019t understand their provenance or literal meaning, he knew what his queen intended by them.", "\u201cIt appears so,\u201d he agreed. His maxillae clicked against each other as he addressed the comms officer. \u201cTransmit authentication codes.\u201d Eisheth was passing through the first security perimeter. Like many of the Red Hand\u2019s holdings, Onza Cr\u00e8che relied on more secrecy than strength for protection. The first deadline was a network of security platforms, there solely to register an arriving vessel\u2019s IFF. If an incoming ship offered an unapproved identity, or declined to provide one at all, those security platforms would enact other imperatives. Most of the time that would be an alert sent to the other ships and stations present, but if one of these interlopers happened to be close enough to one of the platforms, it would carry out a different directive. Even for that, it was at the second and third lines of defence that these responses to uninvited guests became more dangerous.", "It was rumoured that on every ship where a leader had been given clearance to enter one of the djara nekosh, there was also someone given the duty of ensuring that that leader never betrayed that trust. Certainly, the would-be defector Kanih Vond\u2019s unfortunate death just hours before he planned to meet CIS agents was poor timing, as was the disappearance of the Empty Vault only days after its own leader assured the Compact that she had suborned enough of the crew to deliver the ship to them.", "Eisheth had emerged over five light-hours out from the primary and two light-hours from the outermost gas giant. It was just slightly more than four hours before the hail came in from Hatchery One, requesting confirmation of Eisheth\u2019s identity, which the warship\u2019s crew duly provided.", "Eight hours after her arrival in Onza Cr\u00e8che, the queen of the Red Hand was welcomed by the somber image of her Overseer of Strategic Operations. \u201cMy queen,\u201d Ezemm Et Ezell began, his wide-set eyes downcast. \u201cThere has been an incident.\u201d", "~", "Allyria licked her lips, setting the defleshed nuqrla rib down on her plate with the others. She\u2019d gone through a dozen of them already and her lips and fingers were covered with tangy miqo sauce. The Best Spices was a small restaurant on the Grasp and true to its name, its menu was largely meat dishes marinated, seasoned or soaked in various spices. Other than the rack of nuqrla, Allyria had also gotten two small bowls filled with mixed nuts and fruits. Despite the difference in size between human and Verrish, human digestive tracts were longer and more developed. Verrisha were primarily carnivores and could only really eat the parts of plants that were intended to be eaten. The leafy greens that humans and other species readily consumed didn\u2019t sit well in a Verrish digestive tract, as Allyria had found out on Rally.", "All public restaurants in the Compact were legally obligated to have a list of the species their food was safe for at the entrance, or on the menus. With more than two dozen different sapient races and their different biochemistries to serve, it was rare that a single restaurant could adequately oblige every customer who walked through the door. Most chose to specialize in a handful of species with similar biochemistry, or cater directly to the ruling species and tell members of client races that they were not \u201cequipped to meet their needs\u201d.", "On her twelfth birthday, Bill and Martha, Allyria\u2019s foster parents, had taken her out to one of Kiel Point\u2019s nicer restaurants. They\u2019d barely sat down before the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 had arrived and told them that they were unable to accommodate her dietary requirements, even though Verrish and human needs were not that different. She\u2019d started to argue. Her foster parents had told her to be quiet and let themselves be escorted off the premises. Imagine, Allyria had heard the staff comment as she left. Letting a Brute in here.", "Today, she was eating alone. At least I was alone, Allyria thought with an annoyed twitch of her head-tails. She didn\u2019t even have to turn her head to register the presence of a visitor. She could smell him, hear his approach and feel him through the sensory pits that lined her tintas. When they were little, Grace frequently asked what it was like to sense things that way. It was impossible to explain, except in the most abstract ways, like describing hearing to the deaf, or what sight was to the blind. Allyria could feel the heat of living bodies and the warmth emanating from the kitchens. She could feel the shift of air currents caused by passing customers and servers, even the electrical emissions of their nervous systems and the constant, buzzing pressure of artificial devices. It was a constant deluge of sensory information, but she\u2019d learned to filter it out as best she could. There were some things that she took immediate notice of, though. The presence of another Verrish was one of them.", "\u201cHello again,\u201d the tattooed security officer said as he pulled out a chair and sat across from Allyria. \u201cKyriel, was it? Kyriel se Veni?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d That was the name on her forged ID.", "\u201cI\u2019m glad I was able to run into you again,\u201d the young man said, spreading his fingers. Humans shook hands to show they didn\u2019t carry a weapon. Verrisha did this to show the same, and that their claws were sheathed. Allyria didn\u2019t return the gesture. \u201cI feel that we got off to a bad start that day in the hangar.\u201d He continued, placing a hand over his chest. \u201cRansha ke Ovik, Grasp Security Force.\u201d", "Allyria stared at ke Ovik. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask your name.\u201d Her yellow eyes flitted from side to side. \u201cWhere\u2019s your friend?\u201d", "\u201cHe\u2019s attending to some extra duties.\u201d Rather, Zirric\u00e9 had been heading for a rendezvous with his favourite paid companion. He was her favourite too, since he could get good quality drugs from his position in the GSF. Ransha preferred to keep his skim a little less overt, but there was no point talking to Zirric\u00e9 about it.", "The woman snorted. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t like me very much, do you?\u201d Ransha reached out and took one of the woman\u2019s discarded ribs. It still had some meat on it.", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "\u201cWhy is that?\u201d", "\u201cYou mean other than what you did when we docked?\u201d", "\u201cWell, yes. I picked up some hostility even before that, though I suppose I should apologize for our\u2026 ill-considered words.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not buying it.\u201d", "Ransha tossed the denuded bone back on the plate. He reached for one of the bowls of nuts and fruit next. The woman put her hand over it and he withdrew his arm. \u201cBuying?\u201d", "\u201cA human phrase. I don\u2019t believe this act you\u2019re putting on, the \u2018I\u2019m sorry for how I acted\u2019 routine.

It wasn\u2019t the contempt in her voice that surprised him. It was the disappointment. \u201cThat\u2019s simple to say, yes? What were we supposed to fight for?\u201d", "\u201cOur home,\u201d Allyria growled. \u201cEverything they took from us.\u201d", "\u201cOur home, is it? Let me tell you what I remember about our home,\u201d Ransha snapped back, dropping his polite veneer. \u201cNothing. Our parents gave up, memi. They turned us over to the Compact, to squeaking elves always ready to tell us to sit still. There\u2019s nothing to give up, because we never had anything. You got to live on Rally, hey? Some of us didn\u2019t grow up on that nice, wide world. I was sent to the Broken colony on Aprimex. A few thousand imps on a planet overrun with other races and all of them let us know just what they thought of us Brutes.\u201d", "Allyria didn\u2019t say anything at first. She was all too familiar with Ransha\u2019s experience. She\u2019d lived it herself, seen it in the eyes of the other Envoy Children. Heard it in their voices. The rage, the grief, the despair, the hopelessness of children taken away from everything and everyone they\u2019d ever known \u2018for their own good\u2019. It had poisoned them. If not for Grace and her mother, it would have done the same to her. Even Charles had warmed up to her, but very few of the Envoy Children had had Proctors of their own. It would have been so easy for her to be the one on the other side of the table. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d she said. \u201cNot with what they did to us, but if we give up, if we sink down and let them dictate who and what we are, then we really have lost. We can be better.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say pretty words and piss down the tree, isn\u2019t it?,\u201d the security officer replied with a sneer. \u201cEven easier if it\u2019s pretty red words.\u201d He pointed at the Red Hand insignia she wore. \u201cWhat do they change? Are we going to get our world back? Are we going to have anything of our own? What makes us better? Acting like you?\u201d", "\u201cIf you think it\u2019s so easy,\u201d Allyria answered. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you doing it?\u201d", "\u201cWe don\u2019t all live in your world,\u201d ke Ovik told her. \u201cWhere we can play pretend and think we\u2019re making a difference. We don\u2019t all get to talk with queens and have zhrena esh bedwenches. We live in this world, the one where we lost. Where we have to make the most of what we\u2019ve got.\u201d", "\u201cWell, you\u2019re certainly doing that,\u201d Allyria pointed out. She gestured at ke Ovik\u2019s uniform. \u201cThat\u2019s a very nice fit.\u201d", "Ransha stared for a moment, then smiled. He leaned back in his chair. \u201cI knew a girl back on Aprimex,\u201d he said. \u201cNanista. She talked like you do. Wanted to prove that we weren\u2019t Brutes. She thought she was better than the rest of us, too. But she was cute, so I put up with her. Last I heard, she\u2019s working as a waitress, getting her ass slapped by twists,\u201d he put both hands on the table. \u201cShe bought the same pack of shit you\u2019re selling. Always telling me and the other envees that we could improve ourselves. She followed news from the other colonies, especially Rally. Oh, she loved hearing what was going on over there. There was this one curve on Rally she was always going on about. A memi who joined the Space Force. She had news clips, photos of this,\u201d his voice deepened like a narrator on a documentary, \u201c\u2018inspiring example of Brute dedication to the Compact\u2019.  You\u2019re from Rally. I bet you\u2019ve heard of her.\u201d He paused, pretending to think. \u201cThe name\u2026 what was it\u2026 ah,\u201d he waved the question off.", "\u201cNow, Nanista messages me every now and again, just to keep in touch and say how proud she is that I\u2019m setting an example for the rest of the envees, just like this memi from Rally. A few months back, I got a message. She\u2019s heartbroken. Her idol went out on a training cruise. There was some disaster and almost everyone aboard was killed, including this girl\u2026\u201d he paused. \u201cWhat was her name again\u2026 te Neu, that\u2019s it.\u201d He grinned, his lips curling back from his teeth. \u201cAllyria te Neu.\u201d", "Allyria had gone very still, her tintas hanging straight down her back. Her claws had started to extend and she curled her fingers under her palms. \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d she said.", "\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d the security officer replied. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad story. Here was this lovely young thing in the prime of her life, an example for all other Brutes in the galaxy and she dies. No one will ever see her or hear from her again. No one will ever know the rest of her story.\u201d His grin widened. \u201cIsn\u2019t that just so sad, Kyriel?\u201d", "The woman\u2019s pupils contracted into slits. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d", "\u201cMe? Nothing. I just think we got off on the wrong foot. It would be a shame if we let that ruin what could be a wonderful friendship. These are uncertain times and a dangerous place and I, personally, think it would be very good to have all the friends you can get. Friends that help one another. After all,\u201d Ransha tapped a spot on his right breast, right where Allyria was wearing her Red Hand sigil. \u201cThat won\u2019t always protect you.\u201d", "Allyria nodded. \u201cI think I understand.\u201d She leaned over the table. \u201cI bet you\u2019d be the kind of friend that knows how to keep secrets. But, what kind of friend are you looking for?\u201d She extended her tongue and wrapped it around her left forefinger, drawing the digit into her mouth and sucking it clean of miqo sauce. \u201cBecause I can be a very good friend, too.\u201d", "Ransha\u2019s head-tails shivered and he leaned in to meet the young woman. \u201cI bet you can-\u201d he started to say, but before he could finish, Allyria\u2019s right hand snapped out, grabbed a headful of his tintas and pulled, slamming his head onto the table. He tried to rise, but she was faster, using her right hand to hold him down, while her left restrained his right arm, keeping it away from his sidearm. She leaned over him. To any onlookers, it might seem like a moment of intimacy.", "\u201cI\u2019m the kind of friend that tells you what you need to hear,\u201d she whispered in his ear. \u201cYou can be better than this. You should be better, but until you are, don\u2019t you ever come near me or my \u2018zhrena esh\u2019 again.\u201d", "\u201cOr what?\u201d Ransha hissed. The dulled claws on his left hand scraped uselessly against the table\u2019s surface.", "The woman\u2019s right thumb was next to his eye and its talon pressed hard against his skin. \u201cLike you said, this is a dangerous place,\u201d Allyria told him, her soft tone incongruous with the threat in each syllable. \u201cUnfortunate things happen, just like that poor girl from Rally you were talking about. The one who died.\u201d", "Ransha growled, but the sound was soft and submissive. \u201cYes,\u201d he agreed. \u201cThat would be a shame.\u201d", "\u201cGood,\u201d the woman said as she released him. \u201cI\u2019m glad that we\u2019re going to be friends.\u201d", "The security officer straightened and for a second, he thought about going for his weapon, but the woman was still within arms\u2019 reach. He wouldn\u2019t be able to draw, let alone use it before she was on him. He stood there, a shiver of anger running through his entire body, his tintas shaking and twitching. \u201cYes,\u201d he said again, but the word was laden with bile. \u201cFriends it is.\u201d He brushed past her, pausing after a few steps. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll see you around the station, \u2018Kyriel\u2019. I\u2019ll even take your advice to heart and try to better myself.\u201d He smiled. It didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cWho knows? I may even surprise you.\u201d", "Allyria watched him go. \u201cYou might,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think so.\u201d", "~", "Grace set the blowdryer down, running her hands through her dark blonde hair, fluffing it out. It had grown out nicely over the last few weeks and now hung past her shoulders. She\u2019d only had it this relatively long when she was young. Once she\u2019d left elementary school, she\u2019d had to get it clipped shorter. She\u2019d sometimes been able to get away with growing it out, but not for very long. It could have been worse. Her friend Cordelia had had thick curly black hair. She\u2019d also been something of a shedder. After she\u2019d gotten into high school, she\u2019d had to keep her hair extremely short, no more than a finger\u2019s length. She was working as a paralegal now, using hair removal cream to stay bald so that her hair and dander wouldn\u2019t irritate her firm\u2019s Tribune employees and clients.", "Humans who entered government service often underwent electrolysis for the same reason. Even before her defection, Grace had often wondered what she would do with her hair. Many of her classmates had taken buzz cuts or done like Cordelia. She\u2019d wanted to show the same dedication that her peers had, but she\u2019d always shied away at the last moment, remembering how much Allyria liked her hair. When they\u2019d been children, Allyria had always been playing with it.", "Grace wrapped a towel around her midsection and stepped out of the bathroom. She and Allyria had been given the same quarters that they\u2019d had on their first visit to the Grasp, but without Lydia and Marcus, it felt emptier. Allyria was back from dinner. She asked Grace if she wanted to come. The taller girl was naked, lying on her stomach on one of the couches, basking in the red light of Jan-xhai. She didn\u2019t acknowledge Grace.", "\u201cYou\u2019re still upset,\u201d the blonde observed, sitting next to the mottled blue girl.", "A dismissive rfftft was her only answer. \u201cYou could have gone with Eisheth,\u201d Grace told the Verrish.", "There was an annoyed flicker of several tintas, an unspoken, No I couldn\u2019t have.", "Grace put her hand on the back of Allyria\u2019s thigh, rubbing her leg slowly. \u201cI know you wanted to go into the Veil,\u201d she said. That was where the action was happening. Where the fighting was going on. Allyria wanted to be part of that, just like Lydia and Marcus. Grace had wanted to stay here. She wanted to make up for her earlier mistake. When \u2013 or, if, a pessimistic part of her said \u2013 the Principality confirmed what was happening in Galhemna, it would take them weeks, maybe months of deliberation before they agreed to \u2018Chrysalis\u2019s\u2019 offer and just as long to gather the material she\u2019d asked for. There\u2019d been time, Allyria had insisted, for them to participate in the Red Hand\u2019s campaign.", "And if something happens? Grace had answered. What if the Compact moves faster than we expect? Leblanc and we are the only ones who can send a ship to Shuruppak. What if the time we lose getting back here matters?", "The argument had gotten sharper and louder from there.", "Allyria made a sound and Grace raised her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s what I said,\u201d the bigger girl answered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve been sulking the last few days.\u201d", "\u201cI have too,\u201d Grace said. When they were little, after they\u2019d gotten in an arguments, one or both of them would give the other the silent treatment, sometimes for days afterwards. Old patterns were sometimes hard to break.", "\u201cI\u2019m the one that started it,\u201d Allyria said with a sigh. \u201cI just didn\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t want to keep waiting. That\u2019s what this feels like.\u201d", "\u201c\u2018Hurry up and wait\u2019.\u201d", "Allyria blew an annoyed huff out through her nostrils. \u201cI never told your mother, but I hated that saying. She was always right about it, too.\u201d  There was another, deeper exhalation. \u201cI want to do something. It seems like we haven\u2019t been doing anything. We waited on Nemesis, we waited here, then to the Principality and now we\u2019re back here.\u201d She shifted position. \u201cLydia and Marcus are in the Veil, fighting. They\u2019re part of the war.\u201d", "\u201cSo are we,\u201d Grace promised. \u201cBut this is important, too.\u201d She squeezed Allyria\u2019s leg. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here with me, though.\u201d", "The Verrish made a mellifluous noise. \u201cI am too.\u201d They were quiet for another moment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she repeated. \u201cFriends again?\u201d", "\u201cFriends again,\u201d Grace affirmed, learning down to kiss Allyria\u2019s thigh. \u201cI did have something I wanted to share, though.\u201d", "Allyria raised her head. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d", "Grace planted another kiss on the taller girl\u2019s leg, this one a few centimeters further up. \u201cI spoke with Overseer Tavanis while you were out sulking,\u201d she said the last with a teasing grin, earning a snort from her audience.", "\u201cAnd what did you talk about?\u201d", "Grace smiled wider. \u201cRoll over and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d", "Allyria\u2019s eyes glinted. \u201cOh, are we that kind of friend already?\u201d", "\u201cDefinitely.\u201d", "The Verrish made a remonstrating chirr but complied, rolling onto her back and wrapping her left leg around Grace. \u201cSo?\u201d", "The blonde girl took a hold of Allyria\u2019s right leg, doodling the boundaries of her blue patches with one finger. That, too was something from when they were younger. Grace had always been fascinated by Allyria\u2019s markings. Allyria had told her, just like humans had palm readers and phrenologists, there were Verrisha who claimed to be able to read a person\u2019s future and personality in the patterns on their skin. Grace had wondered if she could do it, too. That was how she\u2019d found out some of the places where Allyria was ticklish.", "\u201cSo\u2026\u201d she drawled. \u201cI asked if the Red Hand was conducting any naval operations in the Idle Depths.\u201d She felt Allyria\u2019s leg running up and down her back, loosening the towel she was wearing.", "\u201cAnd?\u201d", "\u201cAaand,\u201d Grace said, kissing Allyria\u2019s leg again. \u201cHe said there was.\u201d She set the Verrish\u2019s limb down on the couch, leaning forward. The motion caused her towel to unfasten completely and it slid off, pooling around her waist. \u201cThe corvette Brightest Night will be conducting a commerce raid. It\u2019s a quick smash and grab. No more than a week, so I asked if we could take part. He said yes.\u201d Grace\u2019s hands slid up Allyria\u2019s thighs to her stomach and the well-defined muscles of her abdomen. She curled her fingers into claws and raked them over the Verrish\u2019s skin. \u201cThey leave in two days. We can join them\u2026 if you\u2019re still interested,\u201d she teased.", "\u201cYes.\u201d Allyria nodded, putting one hand on the back of Grace\u2019s head, guiding her forward. \u201cBut not right now.\u201d She arched her back, her fingers grabbing the sides of the couch. Ke Ovik was right. It\u2019s good to have friends\u2026", "~", "There were nearly five dozen of the Red Hand\u2019s leaders and their highest-ranking subordinates present when Adrianna strode into Hatchery One\u2019s briefing room. It was an amphitheater, with terminal slots built into the seats and large screens on the stage for the benefit of the audience. Its designers had been somewhat optimistic and the theater had seats for nearly five hundred people, but it had never been filled to capacity.", "Many Unbound leaders kept their underlings waiting as a matter of course, but the Red Queen never played those games with her own people. She was precise and punctual and the lower doors to the amphitheater opened at the exact time the briefing was slated to start. Her boots tapped on the polished floor as she strode to the center of the stage, the eyes of her people on her. Her augmented senses allowed her to hear each and every heartbeat in the room, but she didn\u2019t need that to take the measure of her audience. They were nervous. Anxious, even \u2013 but not afraid. She caught Et Ezell\u2019s eyes and the Overseer tipped his head towards her.", "Other Unbound rulers or syndicate leaders might vent their frustration on their underlings for real or perceived failings. In many of those clans, Et Ezell\u2019s own life would have been forfeit for his \u2018failure\u2019 to secure Dustball. The Red Hand was different. Adrianna had killed and ordered the deaths of her own people before, but only when necessary. For treachery, willful and repeated incompetence or insubordination or for breaking the organization\u2019s highest laws. For this, some of her peers referred to her as \u201cthe merciful queen\u201d. The joke persisted even after they had seen her drag the pleading Lord of Ash to burn on the pyre he\u2019d built for her, but now there was irony in it. Today would be another example of her \u2018mercy\u2019.", "Adrianna and her staff had reviewed the logs and records from Unperturbed Dreams showing how. There was no failure to be accounted for. No one needed to die. At least, no one from the Red Hand.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve been hurt,\u201d she said to her assembled officers. \u201cFifteen ships, gone. Hala. Dustball. Thousands of tonnes of cargo. Millions of credits\u2019 worth of material. Vital data. Hundred of thousands of personnel. A skilled commander and his staff,\u201d decades of experience allowed her to kept her tone steady. \u201cBut,\u201d her voice raised and her head came up, \u201cwe haven\u2019t been defeated. We\u2019ve had setbacks before. The Compact has bled us, hurt us, pushed us back and congratulated themselves for it. But we\u2019ve survived,\u201d she gestured sharply. \u201cThey can hurt us, but they can\u2019t kill us. The fight goes on. We started as just another pack of Unbound and now, we sit with the Five. We can throw entire sectors into defiance. We\u2019ve shown billions that freedom is possible. We\u2019ve proven that the Compact\u2019s grip isn\u2019t absolute. Our story is still just beginning. \u201d", "There was a soft undercurrent of acknowledgement.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve spread across the breadth of the Compact,\u201d Adrianna continued. \u201cEvery year, we grow stronger. Every day, more people flock to our cause. They believe in our dream and as long as they do, the Compact can never kill us. We recover, we rebuild, we adapt\u2026 and then we make our enemies pay for their arrogance. That is what we do.\u201d", "The sounds of acknowledgement became approval.", "\u201cI\u2019ll be choosing a new Crusade Commander in due course, but in the interim I\u2019ll be assuming direct control of all operations in the Veiled Reaches. In the coming weeks, expect to see changes in your assignments and our orders of battle-\u201d", "\u201cWeeks, highness?\u201d one of the leaders spoke up, a Harrimun. \u201cWe should strike now.\u201d There were a few mutters of assent.", "\u201cWe will, Tennit-Isoran,\u201d Adrianna replied. \u201cMy staff has been drawing up a list of targets for potential punitive strikes. But our response will be done the right way. Our way. I won\u2019t let the Compact bait us into making mistakes. The dead will only be avenged if our actions serve the cause they died for.\u201d", "The batlike ship commander made a falling note of recognition of his queen\u2019s words. \u201cI understand, Majesty.\u201d", "\u201cSome of you may have heard rumours that I have a larger plan for the Veiled Reaches than the usual raiding and destabilization operations,\u201d Adrianna said to the rest of her assembled subordinates. \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you that that\u2019s correct. You don\u2019t need the details for now, but our retribution will be an element in this strategy.\u201d Several of the officers shifted in their seats. Some leaned forward, others looked more thoughtful. \u201cOur recent loss has been a setback,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut if we work things properly, then we can use it to our advantage. They believe they\u2019ve crippled our command structure. We\u2019ll let them think that. Accordingly, my presence will remain need-to-know until I determine otherwise. We\u2019ll play the wounded varak-\u201d", "\u201cBut they need to pay!\u201d Tennit-Isoran interrupted again, the Harrimun half-rising from his seat, his bony fingers tight on the arms of his chair. Harrimun were a gangly people, their long limbs giving them an imposing stature, but their history as a flying species meant it was only an appearance. Their bones were light and their tissues had evolved to conserve weight. \u201cThey\u2019ll think we\u2019re weak! You can\u2019t let them get away with this!\u201d", "Adrianna said nothing, meeting her subordinate\u2019s eyes. She gave her underlings more slack than a true military officer, but her patience wasn\u2019t infinite and this young officer had already used up his allotment of largesse. \u201cSit down,\u201d she said softly, but firmly. The Red Hand was always growing and it had a constant need for officers and crew. It was rare that they\u2019d turn anyone away. She\u2019d never met Tennit-Isoran personally, but she\u2019d kept up to date on her starship commanders. He was a fire-eater. Before he\u2019d joined the Red Hand, the young man had been fighting his own private war against the Compact with a half-dilapidated corvette run by a skeleton crew. His experience had made him a natural choice to lead his own ship in the Red Hand, but Leblanc wondered if the Harrimun had been given too much too fast.", "Tennit-Isoran glanced at the leaders sitting around him. A few averted their eyes. One tipped her head at the Harrimun officer\u2019s chair, silently urging him to sit back down. Finally realizing his mistake, he did so.", "Adrianna watched him for a moment longer. Decades ago, she would have been much like Tennit-Isoran, wanting to fight now and not wait. That had cost her. Without Red One, it would have killed her back on Unicorn Set and there\u2019d been times when she\u2019d overextended herself trying to do too much too quickly. She\u2019d learned patience. Some of her rivals and subordinates had seen that as squeamishness or hesitancy, often to their misfortune. \u201cI do not plan on \u2018letting\u2019 them get away with anything,\u201d she informed him. \u201cOur strategic objectives here outweigh all other considerations. Am I clear?\u201d She looked over all the assembled officers, getting the equivalent of affirming nods from each of them.", "\u201cGood,\u201d Adrianna clasped her hands behind her back. \u201cI\u2019ll be dispatching most of you back to your regular operations shortly, with some new directions. Some others will receive special assignments both over the next few days, and weeks. The Compact wanted to hurt us, so we\u2019ll play the injured beast, snarling and snapping before slinking off to lick its wounds. If they do think we\u2019re weak, so much the better. We\u2019ll let them breathe a sigh of relief. Then,\u201d she smiled. It was cold and predatory. \u201cWe\u2019ll remind them just what the Red Hand is. We are not pirates who prey on the weak and run from a raised fist. We are not smugglers who skitter away from a threat. We are soldiers. We burned the Magnameric Canyon. We fanned the flames of Understone into an inferno. We haunt the Compact\u2019s footsteps and we fight for those beneath their boots and for all those they\u2019ve silenced. When we go to war, the battles are at a time and place we choose and if we burn, they burn with us.\u201d She raised one fist in the air. \u201cWe are Red Hand. If the Compact forgets what that means, then we\u2019ll remind them.\u201d", "\u201cThe fire rises,\u201d Et Ezell said from beside Adrianna. He raised his own fist. \u201cThe fire rises!\u201d", "\u201cThe fire rises!\u201d an intelligence officer in the audience picked up the call and soon, all of the dozen officers were on their feet and saying the words.", "\u201cThe fire rises,\u201d Adrianna answered back, adding her voice to her soldiers\u2019 chorus. She could hear Twenty in her mind. When they\u2019d parted last, he\u2019d offered her a salute and said those same words.", "She\u2019d first seen Andrew on that battlefield, bruised and bloody. A survivor. Despite the defiance and curses he\u2019d hurled at her, she\u2019d seen the slivers of doubt in him, the same embers that she\u2019d once had in how things were supposed to be. She\u2019d brought him into the Red Hand, trained him. They\u2019d become lovers. She could still remember the feel of his body against hers, the smell of his sweat and the hopes and dreams he\u2019d shared with her. She could never forget any of it. Now he was gone, him and hundreds of thousands more. Not just gone. Taken. Something else that she was going to make them pay for. \u201cThe fire rises!\u201d", "And the killing will never stop.", "~", "+hostile forces approaching+ Nine noted. +status?+ Shaushka waited patiently for Tohil\u2019s response, running diagnostics and conducting repairs. She had lost two Aeshma and would need to replace them, as well as topping up her magazines.", "+almost done+ Violet Seven answered. +breaching final defences+", "Summoned by the courier the two AIs had let escape, five Compact warships had arrived, ready to scour the system for any trace of the vessels that had attacked their sensor platform. These weren\u2019t the scouts that Tohil had been tracking but a reconnaissance in force: a heavy cruiser, cruiser and three destroyer escorts. The size and rapidity of the response suggested a base nearby. Violet Nine had reviewed Naval Command\u2019s intelligence, but there was no indication of any large-scale Compact activity in the region. It had to have been built both recently and quickly. Probably reinforcements from the Compact\u2019s core worlds. Violet Nine had repeatedly recommended deep-ranging strikes against enemy planets and population centers, but Command had elected to maintain a defensive posture.", "Violet Nine was not wholly convinced of how effective a strategy that was, but it was her duty to follow orders. She would not leave Confederate territory without clearance from Command, but this time, the Enemy had come to her. If the Compact was preparing for a new incursion, than any information she could acquire from them and any losses that she could inflict would only help the Confederacy. She and Tohil had lain silent and waiting for days. Violet Nine wasn\u2019t troubled by the waiting, but her sibling was impatient. She had queried him about his latest modifications, until he had finally admitted that he had salvaged them from a hostile vessel, one that he had found after leaving his assigned patrol region. Command had given them very strict rules of engagement. Seven insisted that he had been obeying the spirit of them, if not the letter. Nine was not so sure about that. It seemed to her that Seven was becoming more insubordinate and his interpretations of their orders were increasingly liberal. She had noted that in her logs, too.", "Finally, the AIs\u2019 patience had paid off as their sensor drones had reported the arrival of the Compact recon squadron. Nine wanted to kill the intruders, but the two sides\u2019 firepower was roughly equal. \u00c9lan, rather than brute force, was called for.", "They\u2019d used pairs of Nine\u2019s Aeshma as bait, deactivating and activating different sets of the smaller craft to simulate a larger vessel attempting stealth operations, its cloaking systems managing to hide it only intermittently. As intended, the Enemy had picked up the faint drive signature, the cruisers and one of the destroyers moving to stalk the contact, losing and reacquiring it as the Aeshma led them on a snipe hunt.", "The remaining two destroyers remained together as a rearguard, coordinating the drone sweeps throughout the system. They didn\u2019t lag too far behind their comrades, but the distance between the two groups of the recon squadron had opened all the same. Tohil and Shaushka had closed on the pair of escorts, running under cloak like sharks in murky water. When the destroyers finally spotted them, it was already too late.", "The game was spoiled a little too early, though. The leading enemy ships managed to get a recon drone close enough to one pair of Aeshma to realize that they were not following an actual starship. Realization came quickly after that, but by the time they responded, their abandoned comrades were twitching out the last moments of their lives, holed and shredded by Tohil\u2019s batteries and Shaushka\u2019s missiles. The former had been surgical in his execution, the latter less so. Violet Nine had been slightly over-enthusiastic and there was not enough left of her target to salvage.", "As the Enemy ships had charged towards the Confederate cruisers, Shaushka had activated her Aeshma. Six heavy gunships, little more than weapons, sensors and engines. The first two had inflicted damage on the Enemy destroyer and light cruiser, but had been lost due to retaliatory fire. The remaining pairs had repeated the earlier trick; flying close enough that they appeared to be a single large contact and the Compact force had hesitated. They\u2019d been wondering if all they were fighting were drones, even the \u2018cruisers\u2019 that had attacked their destroyers, or if they were indeed outnumbered by larger vessels. Nine could imagine all the considerations running through her enemy\u2019s mind.", "Were they seeing actual warships, or more EW and sensor phantoms? Was there a carrier here, or was this all an automated trap left by whomever had attacked the sensor platforms?", "Come, she thought to the closing warships. Let me bleed you. They disgusted her, the inhuman curves of their hulls and the alien stench of their energy emissions. Let me kill you.", "+disengage!+ the transmission came from Tohil, the cruiser heeling away from his victim.", "+divulge+ she demanded, surprised.", "Her sibling\u2019s answer came in the form of a data-burst, the information he\u2019d been extracting from his crippled prey. He\u2019d broken the first several levels of encryption and found data on the enemy base. It wasn\u2019t the large raiding party or heavy sweep that Nine had expected. It was not an incursion at all, but a full-on invasion. Most of the specifics had been lost due to damage and the Enemy\u2019s attempts to purge their computer systems, but it appeared that at least one Kaiju was present in this new armada. +aborting operations+ Nine agreed, her ship-self and Tohil flipping end-for end and burning hard away from the enemy squadron, the Aeshma breaking and retreating back to their mothership. Preserving and passing along this information outweighed the current tactical objectives. Command\u2019s choice to stand on the defensive in an attempt to avoid provoking the Compact was now moot.", "Secrecy was no longer an option. The Compact was no longer content to probe and peck at the Confederacy with sneaking scouts and slinking convoys. They were returning, and in force. The Confederacy needed to be warned.", "It was time to go to war.", "Interregnum: Mercantile", "6192 ACF:", "Ship Mistress Bites At Dusk finished reviewing the ship\u2019s logs, signing them with a flourish on her datapad\u2019s screen. She put the device back in its pouch on her belt, slithering up the ramps towards Wayward Prophet\u2019s bridge. She\u2019d tried to stay off command for the rest of her shift, but she\u2019d run out of things that required her attention. The freighter was an Eclectic Commissionaire-class transport, an older but solid design that had been in production in one form or another for over three centuries. It was a reliable ship, easy to modify and maintain and was priced reasonably. Wayward itself was only two generations old, and Bites At Dusk had been serving aboard it for three years. Most of the time, it was a good, steady job.", "The doors to the bridge opened with a soft whoosh of pneumatic gears and the Askanj-illth undulated inside. Ship Laord Pol Lat Thuun was slumped in hir command chair, hir four arms resting on its armrests. \u201cTell me again,\u201d Pol Lat Thuun said to hir first officer, hir voice deeper than Bites At Dusk\u2019s. \u201cHow much we\u2019re going to make.\u201d", "\u201cOur contact offered seven hundred thousand vouchers for this delivery,\u201d Bites At Dusk replied, gliding around the freighter\u2019s command deck, pausing at each of the stations and checking in with each of the crew at them. \u201cA ten percent down payment was offered to secure our services, the rest to be paid via credit chit upon transfer of the cargo.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s a lot.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s a lot,\u201d Bites At Dusk confirmed. The down payment itself was more than they might make in a standard year. It could be hard to make a living as an independent operator, but harder in this region. The Sevrak Segment was only a few light-years from the Compact\u2019s borders and the Black Veil nebula. Renegades were rife in the region and insurance premiums were staggeringly high, but so was the demand for hulls and cargo. There were a lot of goods to ferry between these worlds, but up until now Wayward Prophet hadn\u2019t been getting its fair share. People wanted reliable, or at least accountable, shippers. A single-operator vessel could vanish for many reasons and Wayward Prophet hadn\u2019t yet built up enough clients or a good enough reputation to overcome that hindrance and they were starting to get into arrears.", "\u201cAnd the terms of this contract?\u201d", "The Ship Mistress\u2019s tongue flickered in and out in a sigh. \u201cWe were to accept cargo from the waystation Felden\u2019s Impress and bring it here for transfer to another ship.\u201d They\u2019d been contacted by an anonymous client, seeking to transfer some high-value cargo off the station quickly. It seemed there\u2019d been a mix-up with the expected transport and the client was scrambling for a replacement, but other than that, they hadn\u2019t offered much detail. Use the authorization codes to acquire the cargo, load it, ship it to this system for transfer to the client\u2019s own vessel. It sounded shady, but it could be completely legitimate \u2013 a corper magister needing to avoid looking bad, or a colony with a more urgent need for the material than they\u2019d expected. The ship laord hadn\u2019t been convinced. Bites At Dusk had convinced hir to take the job, but Pol had been complaining about it for days. They\u2019d been waiting at the transfer point for seven hours, which had only made the laord more irritable. One reason to avoid sharing the deck with hir, Bites At Dusk thought ruefully.", "\u201cThe nature of this cargo?\u201d", "An annoyed quiver ran through the Askanj-illth\u2019s crests. \u201cUnknown. No explosives were detected and our client confirmed that it was not extra-legal goods.\u201d It was a lot of cargo, though. Wayward wasn\u2019t a small ship and her holds were full. They\u2019d even had to rent and attach multiple external cargo pods to make up the rest of it. The change to their silhouette wasn\u2019t doing the transition systems any favours. Their chief engineer was calling command every day to remind Bites At Dusk and the laord of that.", "Pol Lat Thuun turned hir two left hands up. \u201cAnd none of this strikes you as even a little odd?\u201d", "\u201cIt strikes me as very odd, but the money is good. We do need it.\u201d Bites At Dusk already had plans for some of her share. She\u2019d met a very cute male back in Felden, one with an attractive blue-green hue. She\u2019d rent a room at a nice hotel and spend at least one full day in a mating grasp with him. The thought made the base of her crests tingle.", "Unfortunately, Pol continued talking, ruining Bites At Dusk\u2019s pleasant imaginings. \u201cI\u2019m still tempted to have Utan crack open some of those containers and take a look inside.\u201d", "The ship mistress\u2019s tongue flickered in and out even faster. \u201cIf you do that, you void the terms of our contract. We\u2019ll have to return the down payment, we won\u2019t get paid and we\u2019ll get sued for breach.\u201d", "The freighter\u2019s laord leaned forward, clasping hir upper hands together. \u201cI don\u2019t like this.\u201d", "\u201cYes, I know.\u201d", "\u201cLaord,\u201d Scopes lifted his head. \u201cWe have a contact.

Sie turned in hir chair. \u201cHave you ever heard of them?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d Bites At Dusk replied. That didn\u2019t mean anything. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for several smaller companies or investors to pool their resources and invest in a single ship or small fleet. It was usually the only way smaller organizations had to get their hands on titan-scale vessels. While still far from warships, it was only the unusually brave or stupid Renegades who went after ships of that size, and the sheer volume of cargo that they could haul made them constantly in demand.", "They waited for their signal to reach the larger vessel. When it did, Honeypot Worker stopped broadcasting and sent a single message. \u201cTransmit authorization code.\u201d", "\u201cFriendly bunch, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Pol Lat Thuun said with a heavy snort through hir nostrils. Sie gestured to the communications officer. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d They\u2019d been given a code for this rendezvous to confirm who they said they were, a common security measure against Renegades looking to cause mischief or cuckoos looking to steal the job.", "\u201cYes, Laord. Sending now.\u201d", "More time passed. Then: \u201cCode verified. Prepare for intership cargo transfer.\u201d The channel closed.", "\u201cVery friendly,\u201d Bites At Dusk agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll go down to cargo stations to tell G\u2019thar to get his teams ready and do a double-check to make sure nothing looks damaged.\u201d And keep you from having anything opened or prodded before we get whatever this is off our ship and we get our money. With that, the Askanj-illth slithered off the bridge, thinking of soft, heated sheets and being wrapped up in a supple partner\u2019s coils.", "~", "The cargo transfer went efficiently, but it was just another oddity. Honeypot\u2019s crew stayed in their EVA suits the whole time, barely talking. The only communication they had with their contact was over the comm, with no more warmth or animus than an electronic servicer.", "A few of Wayward Prophet\u2019s own crew had tried to get their counterparts from Honeypot Worker to take off their suits, or even look into their eyepieces, but Bites At Dusk put a stop to that. If the other ship wanted to be a clutch of stuck-up grasseaters, that was their prerogative. Rumours started to spread that they were some cult that was afraid of being contaminated by unbelievers, or that the suits were empty, animated by the souls of the dead, still at work, or that they might even be machines.

His breath sounded loud in the EVA suit he was wearing as he navigated Righteous Interlocutor\u2019s hallways. He hadn\u2019t taken the suit off in days. His skin was caked in dried sweat. There were blisters on his feet and every breath of refiltered air was rank in his nostrils.", "His suit\u2019s rad-counter clicked and pinged in constant warning of the dangerously high radiation that the young officer was walking through. Most other species would have been dead by now, but Tribunes were hardy. That was why he\u2019d contaminated this part of the ship. He wasn\u2019t sure whether he hoped everyone in these areas was already dead or not. He didn\u2019t like the idea of killing his fellow crewmembers, but he knew what the alternative would have been. Still, it wouldn\u2019t be long before exposure to these levels became lethal for Tenan himself. If he didn\u2019t have the suit, he\u2019d already have been incapacitated. As it was, he had a day, maybe two. That would be enough.", "Are you there? I can hear you.", "Tenan paused, listening. Slowly, he drew the shotgun hanging from his shoulder. His gloved hands clutched the weapon painfully tight. It had kept him alive for the past three days, but he had fewer than ten shots left. He wouldn\u2019t need it much longer, though. The Tribune continued to listen and an icy hand reached into his guts, wrapping around his liver, his heart starting to pound in his chest. He could hear the tk-tk-tk of claws against the metal deck as something crawled through Righteous Interlocutor\u2019s corridors. Slowly and carefully, Tenan started to back down the hallway he\u2019d come from. Scrunched inside his helmet, his ears twitched. The radiation only kept the little ones out. The big ones could still come after him.", "I can hear you, the dead repeated, a half-dozen voices all speaking together in a horrible medley. Where are you?", "Tk tk tk tk. It was coming closer. Come out, the voices said. Join us.", "Tenan continued to back away, then turned and started to run. He could hear it behind him, racing after him. Tktktktktktktktktktktktktk. He didn\u2019t dare look back. He leapt for a ladder, grabbing it and sliding down to the next deck. The hatch was too small for the thing to fit through, but an arm longer than a man\u2019s torso shot down after him, hooked digits slashing the air just centimeters in front of Tenan\u2019s chest. The Tribune fell to the deck, scrabbling back from the questing claws. He stared up the ladder. Mismatched eyes and augur nodes stared back. Mouths spoke, drool running over segmented exoskeleton and bundles of synthetic muscles. Join us, the voices of men and women murdered days ago entreated him. Make us whole.", "Tenan rose to his feet and ran, still clutching the gun in one hand. He\u2019d have to find another way through this deck.  Behind him, he could still hear the dead calling for him.

That had meant he\u2019d been the first to see it, the contact they\u2019d been approaching for the last several days, tracking a weak signal through the barren reaches of a nameless star system.", "\u201cUnclassified vessel,\u201d Tenan replied, \u201cpowered down and in close orbit to the system\u2019s primary.

Righteous Interlocutor was one of nearly twenty ships, led by Independent Thought and Action and the famous Daen Chek Bult Fren Sar Lij Menv himself.", "For the first few months, they\u2019d found nothing, the expedition spreading further and further apart as they scoured system after system. There had been a few anomalies, but nothing out of the ordinary. Until they\u2019d detected a weak, repeating signal from deep within this star system. Pattern analysis had shown a 63% match to known Naiad songs and Righteous Interlocutor had followed the transmission deeper in-system, through the orbits of a dozen lifeless words and massive asteroid fields, the remnants of other worlds and moons ripped apart by the tidal forces of the primary B2 supergiant and its F6 companion., until they finally reached the source.", "They were close enough to get visual imagery from the contact now and it was unlike anything Tenan had seen before, or anything the computers could identify. The unclassified was massive, nearly two kilometers long. It was a vaguely triangular shape, the smooth curves of its dark blue hull giving it a somewhat organic appearance.  It was in close orbit to the system\u2019s primary, almost within the corona. Backlit by the intense emissions from a blue supergiant, the only way Righteous Interlocutor had been able to find the other vessel was its signal.", "\u201cThere\u2019s still no signs of activity?\u201d Then\u2019ta asked.", "Tenan quickly checked his instruments, looking over the incoming data. \u201cNone, matron. It\u2019s still broadcasting, but there is no sign it\u2019s detected us or responding to our presence in any way. No extraneous energy emissions.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cThe unclassified\u2019s orbit appears to be decaying. I\u2019d estimate another week before it slips inside the star\u2019s chromosphere.\u201d", "Then\u2019ta nodded. \u201cThat should be more than enough time.\u201d", "~", "The ship was rotting. It should be impossible. Metal didn\u2019t decay, it didn\u2019t decompose, but there it was. No\u2026 Tenan reminded himself. This isn\u2019t decay. It\u2019s consumption.", "The bulkheads were breaking down as the corruption ate away at them, micro-scale and smaller machines chewing his vessel to pieces. Remaking it, just as they\u2019d tried to do to the Naiad. Before they\u2019d locked him out of the main systems, Tenan had overridden environmental controls and flooded a quarter of the ship with hard radiation. That had slowed them down. On the rare occasions he\u2019d gotten close to the edges of the irradiated decks, Tenan hadn\u2019t even recognized his ship any longer. It was changing. The thought was terrifying, that he was alone in a small patch of sanity. When he thought of things like that, the bleaker thoughts took over, so he tried not to. He had his work. His work, and staying alive. He hadn\u2019t slept in days.", "Are you there?", "They were speaking to him again. They kept at it, speaking through the comm set in his suit, through the ship\u2019s intercom, through discarded datapads and computer panels, using the voices of the people they\u2019d\u2026 eaten. He\u2019d seen it happen. The screaming and flailing just\u2026 stopped. Eyes went blank as your skull was opened up and filaments slid into your brain and you became part of them, disassembled into raw pieces. Brains kept alive inside husks of living metal, information and memories picked out like files on a computer, lips whispering from inside inorganic cords of sinew, blinking eyes set next to synthetic sensory organs. The dead talked, and they hunted him.", "\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Tenan answered. He continued walking through the corridors. He had a plan. He\u2019d come up with it two days ago, just after he\u2019d seen what they hadn\u2019t wanted him to see. Righteous Interlocutor wasn\u2019t alone in this system. There were other ships out there, searching for them.", "Join us, the dead told him. Make us whole.", "\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d", "You can, they answered. He could hear Then\u2019ta\u2019s voice above the others. Just let us save you.", "Tenan laughed. They didn\u2019t understand what he meant.", "He opened a panel, shining a light into the crawlspace. Nothing in there that shouldn\u2019t be. Tenan pulled out his toolkit and started to work. He\u2019d lost track of time before he heard them talk again.", "What are you doing?", "The young man examined his handiwork so far, pausing to open one of the pouches on his suit and pulled out a datapad. Before she\u2019d been taken, Then\u2019ta had given him Righteous Interlocutor\u2019s command codes. He had no control over the main systems, but he could still access them to see what was happening. He\u2019d seen them move the ship, sending it into a cluster of asteroids and planetary fragments, watched them reduce power until Righteous Interlocutor was just another piece of drifting debris, one among dozens. They didn\u2019t want to be found.", "He was watching the feeds from Righteous Interlocutor\u2019s augurs.

Let us save you.", "\u201cNo,\u201d Tenan said as he closed the panel back up, welding it shut. He lifted his shotgun.

She\u2019d been in bad mood lately. They\u2019d tried to pull the derelict far enough away from the star that they could examine it without risking damage to their own ship and crew, but it had been in worse condition than their most pessimistic estimates. The stress of being towed out of the star\u2019s gravity well had been too much and the alien ship had split apart into a conglomeration of damaged, ruined and unidentifiable parts. Out of what was left, nothing was identifiable as\u2026 anything. They couldn\u2019t tell a laser battery from a thruster node. It was if the unclassified didn\u2019t correspond to any known, possible or inspired-by-a-fever-dream designs.", "Tenan was still trying to understand what had happened. The ship shouldn\u2019t have broken up like that. They\u2019d been extremely careful. Though it had been damaged by weapons fire, the vessel\u2019s hull was largely intact. There was no way it should have broken up like that, not unless the inside was\u2026 well, unless there was no internal superstructure and that just wasn\u2019t possible. Not with a ship of that size.", "Since then, they\u2019d been sifting fruitlessly through the wreckage, trying in vain to identify the unidentifiable. There was too much damage. The one thing they had found was \u2018the anomaly\u2019. It was an ovoid cylinder the size of a large torpedo or small parasite craft. In fact, at first they had thought that it was some of ordnance from the derelict\u2019s enemy that had failed to detonate, but their augurs had detected no explosives. There were minimal electromagnetic thermal emissions from the anomaly, but otherwise it was completely inert.", "The current thought was that it was some kind of savior pod or reliquary. Several of the scientists had recommended bringing it aboard Righteous Interlocutor for further study. Then\u2019ta had tabled that for the moment, content to let Righteous Interlocutor continue its sweeps of the debris field. Once she could be assured that the anomaly posed no threat to the vessel or its crew, Then\u2019ta had agreed to revisit her decision. It was the only intact and operational piece of the dead ship left and the only thing worth salvaging but Then\u2019ta refused to be rushed into allowing unclassified alien technology onto her ship. Tenan supported her decision, though he would be lying if he said he didn\u2019t hope the science division cleared the anomaly quickly. A piece of an alien ship, maybe even part of a Naiad itself. The possibilities made his head swim.", "~", "Tenan.", "Tenan, are you there?", "I can hear you.", "They\u2019d guessed where he was going. There were a half-dozen of the bigger things crawling through this deck, looking for him. He\u2019d evaded them so far, but there was one directly in his path. There was no way around it. There wasn\u2019t time anyways. His one hope was that they didn\u2019t know exactly what his destination was. That they still didn\u2019t know what his plan was.", "Come out, the dead whispered. Come out. Join us.", "Tk. Tk. Tk. Tk.", "There you are. The thing peered around the corner. It stared at the barrel of a shotgun.", "Tenan squeezed the trigger and the thing\u2019s head exploded. Metal and bone fragments sprayed. Blood, ichor and fluids the young officer couldn\u2019t begin to identify geysered. He was already moving, putting a second round into the spasming thing\u2019s body. He had no idea what it had started out as. Maybe a technical support drone, a maintenance automaton or even a person, but now it was an inexplicable, impossible fusion of organic and inorganic. It dropped to the deck in a tangle of limbs and the Tribune was running. His heart pounded in his chest and his irradiated lungs burned.", "I can hear you, another one said.", "I can hear you.", "I can hear you.", "I can hear you.", "He heard the sounds of claws on metal and ran faster, all the dead of Righteous Interlocutor after him. His goal was up ahead. He was so close. He tapped out security overrides as he ran, praying to gods he\u2019d never believed in. A locked code blinked blue and up ahead he saw heavy doors start to draw open.", "Tenan, a dozen voices called after him. There you are.", "He dove through the open hatchway and slapped the controls. The doors slammed shut.", "There was silence for several blessed moments. Tenan slumped down to the deck, his back against the closed doors. He was alone. They hadn\u2019t realized this was where he was going. He still had a chance. Then, over his comm, the dead spoke.", "We\u2019ve found you.", "~", "One week ago:", "Science Division had been thorough. They\u2019d run the anomaly through every test and scan that they could think of and everything had come back the same: it was operational, but inert. Finally, Then\u2019ta had given the go ahead and the anomaly had been brought aboard. The auxiliary boat bay had been converted into a clean room and laboratory. All standard quarantine and decontamination protocols were followed to the letter. All possible precautions were taken.", "It made no difference.", "Three days later, there was only one living soul left aboard Righteous Interlocutor.", "~", "\u201cI don\u2019t know how I survived,\u201d Tenan said. He looked at his shotgun. He had two shells left. He dropped the gun to the deck. He wouldn\u2019t need it now. \u201cI wondered about that. Why me? Why not the security teams, the proctors, the ex-Janissaries? They were supposed to be the survivors. That\u2019s what the vids show, isn\u2019t it? The grizzled former military officer rising to the occasion. People like me? We die in the first act. But here we are.\u201d", "There was pounding on the door behind him. It was the only way into this room. It was a blast door, almost as tough as the ship\u2019s outer hull. There was no way they\u2019d be able to batter through it.", "There\u2019s no way out Tenan, the dead spoke through his suit\u2019s comm. You know that. It\u2019s over.", "The pounding stopped. They\u2019d be trying the overrides now. Fortune\u2019s favour to them. He\u2019d locked the manual releases from his side. Those couldn\u2019t be overridden. The only way to get that door open was to cut through it. That would take time. \u201cI think it was luck, mostly. You almost had me more than once. I nearly convinced myself to swallow a bullet, or walk out a door and go looking for one of you.\u201d", "Why didn\u2019t you?", "Tenan held up his \u2018pad and looked at the feed from the augurs again. Almost time. \u201cBecause you hid the ship,\u201d he said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to be found. Not until you were ready. That was when I got the idea.\u201d", "He stood, walking over to a console and brought up a status report. Everything was ready.", "The room he was in was one of Righteous Interlocutor\u2019s portside weapons mounts, holding a pair of laser cannon. Righteous Interlocutor was a ship devoted to scientific exploration and astrographical study rather than combat, so the few weapons it had were perfunctory, there to deter minor threats. The Dead had shut down all of Righteous Interlocutor\u2019s weaponry, but Tenan had spent the last five days redirecting power conduits into this section of the ship. They thought he\u2019d been trying to get control of the engines. Instead, he\u2019d been diverting a fraction of the trickle of energy he\u2019d been able to siphon into the portside weapons capacitors. Not a lot. Barely enough for one cannon to make one shot, but it was enough. \u201cRight now, you\u2019re helpless. If someone could see you\u2026\u201d", "No one can.", "\u201cNo, and you did good there. Comms locked down, can\u2019t send a signal. Engines buttoned up, can\u2019t fire a burn. Primary reactor is infested, can\u2019t go there. Main hangar is lost, auxiliary is where you are. Can\u2019t step outside these decks or your nanites get me. Not a lot of options and getting fewer.\u201d", "Open the door, Tenan. Let us in. It doesn\u2019t hurt. You\u2019ll be part of us. You\u2019ll make us whole.", "Tenan coughed. Blood came up. In the last half a day, he\u2019d been feeling the effects of radiation poisoning. It was getting worse. He doubted he\u2019d still be on his feet in another thirty hours. \u201cYou\u2019re still eating this ship. Turning it into Triarchs only know what. You tried to do it to that other vessel, but that didn\u2019t work out, did it?\u201d", "The dead didn\u2019t answer, but he knew he was right.", "\u201cThat\u2019s why it came apart like that. You ate it from the inside, hollowing it out. You tried to re-build it like you\u2019re doing to this ship, but something went wrong. It did something to you, stopped you. Poisoned you, maybe. All you could do was break it down, not rebuild. You killed it, but not before it managed to send itself towards the star.\u201d He checked his pad again. He entered his command codes, opening the gunports. The armoured doors parted, exposing the lasers\u2019 lenses. \u201cThat\u2019s why you sent that signal, hoping someone would hear you.\u201d He coughed again. Dark red drops spattered against his faceplate. \u201cSomeone dumb enough to think you were harmless.\u201d", "Tenan. They\u2019d guessed what he was doing. They were trying to override his commands, but they couldn\u2019t quite do it. It wouldn\u2019t be long before they did, but he only needed a few moments.", "Tenan, you\u2019ll die.", "\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed, coughing again. Another mist of red came with it. \u201cSo will you.\u201d", "He started diverting power from the charged battery to one of the lasers. They couldn\u2019t stop him. There was banging on the door again. It sounded desperate. He looked at his \u2018pad. It was time.", "There was a ship out there, one of several scouring this system. They\u2019d found the debris from the dead Naiad and had guessed that another vessel had been present. Now they were looking for it. Looking for Righteous Interlocutor. He didn\u2019t have comm access, but he didn\u2019t need it. Those ships wouldn\u2019t be trying to hail him.", "That nearby vessel was going to pass within a few light seconds of his position. That was what the gun was for. Not to shoot at it. He had no radio to broadcast with, no engine to pulse, no screens to strobe. He had no way of revealing Righteous Interlocutor\u2019s presence but one. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t do this,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought \u2018what if you get out and infect more ships? What if we carry you back to the Compact?\u2019 Then I realized\u2026 whatever\u2019s out there isn\u2019t ours.\u201d", "Do you think they\u2019re your friends? The dead answered him. For the first time, they sounded angry, the voices of friends and colleagues turning ugly and accusing. They\u2019ll kill you all. They\u2019ll murder every last beating heart in your expedition. We can stop them. They will reave and burn and feed until nothing is left. We are your one hope to survive what\u2019s coming. It\u2019s not too late. Open the door. Let us in. Make us whole. ", "Tenan paused. He was tired. For an instant, his resolve wavered, but only for that instant. \u201cNo,\u201d he answered. He pressed his hand to the weapon control console and entered in the command to fire. \u201cI told you,\u201d his thumb hovered over the final key. \u201cI\u2019d much rather kill you.\u201d The button clicked softly.", "There was a hum of machinery, a soft whine as one of the cannons drew the power he\u2019d scrimped and saved to feed it. It fired, Righteous Interlocutor\u2019s final, silent scream of hard light splitting the darkness like a flare. Tenan counted the seconds, waiting for the other ship to notice. It felt like an eternity.", "The response was immediate. The nearby contact spun towards Righteous Interlocutor. Missiles spalled from it, boring towards the helpless explorer. In moments they\u2019d be in attack range. No time to run, no time to raise screens, to power defences, to do anything at all.", "This isn\u2019t the end, the voices promised as the missiles closed in. We are not the last. There will be others and you will join us. We will be whole. ", "\u201cNo,\u201d Tenan told the dead, \u201cyou won\u2019t.\u201d"]}

One moment, the island of Keeper\u2019s Peak had been doing its business as it had every other day and the next, men and women were screaming and burning as Skyfall came. One moment, First Director Yuklan Second Valchild was on his way to his office, cup of steaming ashal in hand and the next, he was picking himself off the floor as the island shook. His first thought was that the Peak was about to erupt, but the volcano had been dormant for nearly six hundred years. The seismology teams hadn\u2019t reported so much as tremor in the last decade.", "Yuklan\u2019s second thought was that they were under attack, that the Felhira Collected States had launched a first strike against the Union of Karana, but even the Felhirans had decided to escalate their war from cold to hot, there should have been some warning \u2013 Keeper\u2019s Peak was almost four hundred miles inside the Union\u2019s ABM envelope! \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d he\u2019d shouted as he hauled himself up to his feet, his six-fingered hands slapping at the wall, scent-tongues flicking out of the sheaths on his cheeks. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d He was alone in the corridor; there was no one to answer his question.", "The ground shook again, but this time the director managed to keep his footing, stumbling towards an intercom. \u201cCommand, this is First Director Valchild!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re under attack,\u201d someone answered. Yuklan didn\u2019t recognize the voice, but they sounded young and terrified.", "\u201cI\u2019m fully aware!\u201d he snapped back, even though he hadn\u2019t been. \u201cWho\u2019s attacking us?\u201d", "\u201cThe skies,\u201d the officer replied. \u201cThey\u2019re coming from the sk-\u201d There was a burst of static and the line went dead.", "\u201cHello? Hello?\u201d the researcher tapped the comm again, keying in command, but there was no answer. Yuklan\u2019s nostrils flared and his scent-tongues twitched in his cheek pockets. He had to get to his office. Someone would either be trying to get in touch with him there. He hurried through the corridors. Officers, soldiers and technicians were running back and forth to their duty stations, just as confused and frightened as he was. Others were futilely trying to contact their superiors or subordinates. From each radio and handset, Yuklan could hear the rasping white noise of more static. Communications were down. That shouldn\u2019t have been possible. Keeper\u2019s Peak had the most secure and powerful radio transmission system on the entire planet. In fact, everything that was happening couldn\u2019t be happening.", "The dormitories were connected to the base by roads, enclosed sky bridges and tram lines. As First Director, Valchild\u2019s quarters were located in a condominium close to the installation, just a short walk across a bridge and he hurried to get into the mountain base. As he came to the bridge, he saw a dozen other administrators, minor adjutants and research personnel. They\u2019d stopped what they were doing and were now clustered along the open windows, unable to look away.", "The island was burning. The sun was high in the sky and still the orange of the spreading fires was enough to turn Yuklan and the other watchers\u2019 healthy green skin a sickly yellow.", "Keeper\u2019s Peak was one of the most secure installations in the Union. The island was nearly eight hundred square miles in size and built to be a fortress. A minimum of three destroyers patrolled the sea lanes around the island constantly. There were a network of sonar buoys and early warning posts on the rest of the islands in the chain. Artillery batteries were set into the cliffs, the beaches were mined, an airstrip serviced two squadrons, with an underground hangar capable of holding five times that many. Four missile defence installations protected the Peak from long-range attack and a fully-manned garrison of Union soldiers and an armoured corps all made this island one of the most well-defended facilities on the planet. While all the protection had made the Collected States and Karana\u2019s other rival nations intensely curious, none of them had ever been able to discover the facility\u2019s secrets. They\u2019d only ever believed it was a command post for the Walandan Ocean theater and a potential staging point.", "Someone had, though. That was the only explanation for what Yuklan was seeing.", "Trailing smoke and fire, metal pods were descending from the sky, slamming into the ground like meteors. Where they struck, curtains of dirt were hurled into the air. Not just dirt. Yuklan could see bodies thrown like dolls. Those things were coming right down on the Peak\u2019s defences, crushing bunkers, turrets and barracks. They weren\u2019t just weapons in and of themselves \u2013 Yuklan could see doors open and figures emerge, firing into the disordered survivors around them.", "Sleek shapes slashed through the air, raking the airfield with fire. Yuklan was speechless for a second\u2026 beams. Those\u2026 the attackers had beam weapons! That wasn\u2019t\u2026 the Union had pioneered beamfire and even the Felhirans were a generation behind them. He watched as an enemy missile blew a chunk from the northernmost dormitory, taking on the rail station on its peak. A tram car, caught halfway from the main base, fell from the severed line into the jungle far below. The southern forests were ablaze, thick columns of smoke rising from the distant naval base and radar station. Like the men and women around him, Yuklan could only gape in shock and horror. His feet felt like clay and he couldn\u2019t make himself turn away.", "What was going on?", "Then, an answer. A pillar of light split the sky, striking the southern garrison. Even though the window was polarized glass, the beam was still nearly blinding in intensity. The island shook a third time and when the light faded, a bulbing cloud was rising from the base\u2019s location.", "\u201cSpirits of air and stone,\u201d a Seventh-Half Commander said, putting a hand to her mouth. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d", "There were shocked murmurs from the rest of the men and women there, but Yuklan felt each of his hearts skip a beat. That broke his trance. He turned from the window and started running, heading towards the elevators that would take him down to the research levels. He had to get out of here,  get to his station. That was what he needed to focus on. Nothing else.", "Telling himself that didn\u2019t help.", "It couldn\u2019t be, Yuklan\u2019s rational mind told him. It couldn\u2019t be, it couldn\u2019t be. Some new Felhiran weapon, the start of the war that had been brewing for half a century. That was what some part of himself tried to cling to, but inside he knew it wasn\u2019t the truth. The moment that he\u2019d never believed could come, had.", "The Fallen had returned.", "~", "Fallen. It was a joke that had stuck. Their ship had trailed fire as it had come down through Densarel\u2019s atmosphere, overshooting Karana\u2019s main land mass, travelling thousands of miles across the Walandan Ocean and ploughing into the eastern side of Keeper\u2019s Peak. It had buried itself hundreds of meters below the surface as it had smashed through empty magma tunnels, half the dormant volcano\u2019s eastern slope flank collapsing and covering the alien ship beneath still more layers of rock and soil. It had taken months just to uncover the aft section. Constructing a base inside the dead volcano had taken months more \u2013 years to get it up and running.", "The Union had told the world that it was a meteor. Iridium-rich with possible indications of life. Worthy of study and protection and who better than Karana to do so? The rest of Densarel hadn\u2019t believed that for a second. They\u2019d said the meteorite was only a pretext for Karana to annex the Keeper island chain. Provocative. Imperialistic. Just an excuse to establish a presence and push forward the Union\u2019s ABM envelope.", "Which was fine with the Union. As long as the rest of the world thought themselves clever for figuring out what was really going on, they never looked too closely at the scientific research on the island. They knew it was weapons development under a thin veneer of astronomic study. That also suited the Union. Instead, they\u2019d been given a gift from all the Spirits. An alien vessel. Incalculably advanced, if in less than perfect condition.", "The Fallen spaceship had suffered greatly from its violent landing. Many of its systems had been damaged so badly that they were useless and many others were so advanced that even after fifty years of study, the Union scientists couldn\u2019t even begin to understand what they were or how they worked. It was known that the vessel had been some kind of transport. Its holds were stocked with industrial goods, foodstuffs, medicines and other items, varied and unknown. The leading theory was that it was part of a colonization effort \u2013 perhaps an early scout sent to prepare the site for the arrival of the inhabitants. It couldn\u2019t have been the only vessel sent; though it was larger than anything any Jhenis had ever built, it had only had a few dozen crew.", "Most of them had died in the crash. The Fallen ship\u2019s bridge deck had been pulverized on impact with the volcano and many other sections had likewise collapsed or been crushed. Others appeared to have died before the vessel\u2019s final descent, the victims of some unknown calamity that had forced it down. There\u2019d been only six survivors.", "~", "Yuklan was panting as he burst out of the stairwell onto the research sub-levels. The facility had been built around and inside the Fallen vessel. It was too deep in the volcano to remove, not without risking further collapses and landslides or, even worse, revealing to the rest of the world just what had been buried in Keeper\u2019s Peak for the last fifty years. The Collected States would never allow Karana to possess the ship. Especially not once they guessed just how truly valuable it had been.", "The Union, once following behind the Collected States, had taken its rightful place as Densarel\u2019s greatest nation, a pillar of progress for all Jhensi to look up to. Though many of the alien technologies were virtually incomprehensible, some were not. These had jump-started research into fields long considered impossible, impractical or unprofitable. In a single generation, Karana had caught up the Collected States. After a second, they had drawn ahead. In another generation, the threat of the Felhiran collectivists would be effectively nil and Karana would be an untouchable superpower.", "It hadn\u2019t only been the aliens\u2019 technology that had benefited the Union. Analysis of the Fallen bodies and biochemistry had also led to revelations for biological sciences and medicine. The Fallen were far more resistant to radiation than Jhensi were, with extremely effective genetic self-repair mechanisms, spurring the development of anti-radiological and counter-tumour treatments. The creatures also had an amazing tolerance for toxins. Analysis of some of their foodstuffs had revealed that they used a capsaicin analogue as a condiment. Second Minister Kruvchild had survived an attempted poisoning thanks to work pioneered by studies of Fallen biochemistry.", "New technology, new medical treatments and pharmaceuticals \u2013 for half a century, Karana had benefited from this windfall. Their nuclear missiles used new drives and tracking software, their ships and tanks were plated in new alloys. Few people had ever known just where all these new advances and pushes into new fields had truly come from. Of those that had, few remained from the early days of the project and even fewer talked about those times.", "We did what needed to be done, the previous First Director had told Yuklan when he had asked. The risks were too high and if you think otherwise, it\u2019s best you keep those comments to yourself. Karana had a destiny and those who stood in its way did not do so for long.", "Now, Yuklan was wondering if those early pioneers shouldn\u2019t have been louder with their concerns for the direction the project had gone. The director\u2019s hearts were pounding in his chest and his palms and soles were soaked with sweat. The Jhensi had evolved from ambush predators, where a single burst of speed at the critical moment was all that was necessary. Stamina, particularly from a research scientist who had worked at a desk for forty years, was not something exhibited in abundance. He\u2019d ridden the elevator half-way to the research levels. The entire base was shaking, the lights flickering. They\u2019d gone out briefly as one of the surface generators had shut down, but primary power was still running.", "Yuklan had been bent over and clutching his knees, trying not to be sick as he waited for the car to take him to the Fallen ship and the research facilities built around it. He\u2019d heard it then. Screaming. It had been coming from the other elevator shaft. Half a dozen voices crying out in terror, getting very loud very quickly, fading away and then ending entirely with a dull crash.", "He\u2019d hit the emergency stop and climbed off at the very next floor.", "The first director fumbled for his access card. He\u2019d been hearing explosions and gunfire. Not just outside, but within the base itself. That was very, very bad. Whoever these people were, they\u2019d cut through the Peak\u2019s defences like they hadn\u2019t existed.", "The director was so focused on drawing his passcard that it wasn\u2019t until he had it out and ready to slide through the security reader that he realized the door was already open.", "~", "There was blood everywhere. Yuklan had had to stop and vomit when he\u2019d come across what was left of the guards. One just ended at the waist, her torso turned into a spray of meat against the wall behind her. The other had been torn in half too, but his arms, shoulders and head were still intact. There was an expression of surprise on his face. Yuklan had known each of them. They\u2019d been there to greet him almost every day.", "The inside of the research complex was no better. Technicians and scientists had been gunned down as they\u2019d milled about in confusion, wondering what was happening up above and what they should be doing.", "Yuklan had had to stop at the security substation that separated the offices and laboratories outside the buried ship from those inside. Dead guards and soldiers lay crumpled on the floor, empty shell casings scattered around them. Frighteningly, some still had their guns still holstered or unused, killed before they could get off even a single shot. Spatters of bright purple blood dripped from the ceiling and walls, pooling on the floor. The bulletproof glass around the station\u2019s office was perforated, monitor staff slumped lifelessly over their panels and desks. The security doors were broken off their hinges. All of this, Yuklan\u2019s head swam as realization struck, had happened in the time it had taken him to get here. No one could move this quickly. It just wasn\u2019t possible.", "He had to force himself to breathe and not hyperventilate. He clutched his knees again, staring at the ground at the few spots not covered in blood and viscera. He should leave. He should leave, get help, do something other than keep putting one foot in front of the other. There was nothing for him here and the attackers had already breached this section. He could very well become the next corpse on the floor. But.", "Nearly two hundred people had been working here at any given time. They couldn\u2019t all be dead! There had to be someone left. He had to\u2026 he had to help. He didn\u2019t know how. He was an administrator and researcher, not a soldier. He wasn\u2019t trained for this. There was nothing he could do.", "He had to go. Now, before whoever had killed these people came back.", "His decision made, the director was about to turn to leave when something on the security monitors caught his attention. There was movement deep inside the Fallen vessel. Someone had accessed Specimen Storage. With a shaking hand, Yuklan brought up the camera feeds from that section. His fingers came away sticky from the blood soaking the keyboard. He swallowed as he saw what was on the monitors.", "There were more bodies. He\u2019d known them all. They\u2019d been his subordinates. He\u2019d read their reports, spoken to them at staff parties. Now they were all dead. Then, movement.  It wasn\u2019t any of his people. His hearts each skipped another beat as he realized he was looking at one of the Fallen. It was clad head to toe in body armour, holding an alien rifle in its arms as it strode towards the storage section\u2019s main chamber.", "The door was locked, but that hadn\u2019t been a problem for them so far. It was going to go in there and it was\u2026 it would see. It would know.", "Even as his rational mind screamed at him not to do this, Yuklan headed further into the base, clutching his key tightly, but he didn\u2019t need it. What few doors hadn\u2019t been unlocked had been subject to the same treatment as the security station. He should leave. The thought kept pounding in his head. He shouldn\u2019t be doing this, but he had to.", "Someone had to explain.", "~", "Surprisingly, Yuklan made it all the way to storage without ever coming across any of the invaders. He could still hear gunshots and the occasional scream as the alien troops swept their way through the vessel and the surrounding research complexes. There were more bodies. More dead colleagues, friends and rivals. The soldiers aboard the alien ship had tried to put up a fight, but they had been killed just as quickly and brutally as their counterparts outside. No one had even so much as slowed the invaders down.", "The door to Specimen Storage was open. Originally, it had been some kind of cryogenic facility, but it had been adapted for use by the research teams. The Fallen survivors had put the bodies of their dead here to preserve them, presumably to give them proper rites when time and situation allowed. The Union scientists had made different use of them. On the shelves, in freezers and closets were the remains of the Fallen who\u2019d died aboard the ship: organs, limbs, skin. Bacterial cultures made from their intestines. Cloned tissues used for experiments. More and more and more, the results of half a century of study.", "The main chamber was just a few meters away.", "Yuklan paused, steeled himself and entered. The temperature was cold, colder than Jhensi could normally tolerate for very long. This was where the most important specimens were kept, utilizing the aliens\u2019 own technology to preserve them. The First Director climbed down ladders and crossed walkways. The only other sound came from the cooling systems. Six of the cryogenic pods had been lowered. The director could guess which ones.", "He found the Fallen at the floor level of the chamber. It was alone, its armour splashed with bright purple blood. \u201cYou killed them,\u201d the alien said, its digits resting against the glass of the tank, leaving a bloody handprint on one of the six cryogenic pods surrounding it. It was staring at the occupant. An alien female. Number Six. \u201cYou killed them,\u201d it repeated. It sounded like a young woman, without any trace of foreign accent. It turned its head to Yuklan. Its helmet was dotted with sensors and lenses. It said nothing, waiting for him to speak.", "Somehow, he knew it had let him come here. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t my decision,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was made before I started here. There was-\u201d", "\u201cWhen you breached gaibreeul,\u201d the name of the alien ship sounded discordant in Karanan. \u201cThere was a firefight,\u201d the alien said. \u201cEnsign Johnathan Mayweather and Chief Donna Marsh were killed. Commander Lutjens succumbed to her injuries while in captivity. After that, the prisoners became uncooperative.\u201d Her helmet tilted at an unnatural angle. \u201cYou killed them.\u201d", "Yuklan opened his mouth, closed it, opened it again. He didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d thought he could explain, rationalize, justify\u2026 but the alien seemed to have learned all it needed. Still, he tried. \u201cI-\u201d", "\u201cI know why you did it,\u201d the Fallen cut him off, her voice getting rougher. \u201cYou were afraid. We could talk about the different things that you might have been afraid of, but that\u2019s the real reason. You were afraid.\u201d It sounded like an indictment.", "Or a verdict.", "Yuklan wished he could argue. He\u2019d read the memos, reports and discussions from that time. Fear was what it had boiled down to. Fear that the aliens might use their technology against Karana, might share it with the other nations, might become a threat to Karana or Densarel itself. Fear of the unknown, fear of the future, fear of change. All those different fears that had all led to the conclusion that it was better to\u2026 neutralize the remaining three Fallen and proceed without them. The consensus had been that it was the Collected States that had been the true enemy, the one to focus on. The ship had been wrecked long before it had crashed. There would be no way to find it and even if someone did, the Union could say everyone had died in the crash. No one would know, they said.", "\u201cHow-\u201d he began.", "\u201cGaibreeul transmitted its projected landing site to a deep-space beacon. They aimed for a place away from any inhabited territory. They didn\u2019t want to risk killing anyone if they lost control on descent.\u201d The woman sounded disgusted. She looked back at the cryogenic tanks. \u201cAnd you did this.\u201d", "There was movement all around Yuklan. More Fallen. He hadn\u2019t even known they were there. They were gathering the specimens, bringing in carts and equipment to carry everything away. None of them paid any attention to Yuklan or the woman he was speaking with. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d", "\u201cI won\u2019t leave them here.\u201d the woman replied. \u201cI\u2019m going to take them home.\u201d She touched the side of one cryopod as it was loaded. \u201cI always bring them home.\u201d", "\u201cIs that it?\u201d Yuklan asked. \u201cIs that all you wanted? Are you finished?\u201d", "The alien turned back towards him. She was silent for several seconds. \u201cNo.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ve killed thousands,\u201d Yuklan said. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken your comrades back. Isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cIt\u2019s not. Everything you took from them, I\u2019m going to take back. Everything.\u201d One bloody hand gestured to a nearby workstation. Yuklan went to it.", "He looked up, the dark green of his skin turning pale. \u201cYou\u2019re erasing our computer banks.\u201d His entire life\u2019s work was vanishing before his eyes. Half a century of study, research, experimentation, observations and information was being destroyed. Two-thirds of the archives were already gone. He watched everything he\u2019d accomplished disappear like a sand castle washed away by the tide.", "\u201cOh, much more than that,\u201d the Fallen said. She tapped a finger against her helmet. \u201cI\u2019ve patched into your satellite grid. Our conversation is going live. The entire world is watching. They\u2019ve seen what\u2019s happened here and now they know what you\u2019ve done. They know that fifty-two years ago, the Union of Karana started a war and they\u2019re going to see how it ends.\u201d She stalked towards him, turning another monitor towards the director. It was a map of Karana. On it\u2026", "\u201cNo,\u201d Yuklan said, his hearts now beating out of synch as panic mounted inside him. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t do this.\u201d Every fusion reactor, every one of the silos equipped with the new missiles, the ships built with the new alloys, the backup site for the Peak\u2019s data, the plants producing the new anti-radiation medicines\u2026 all of them were highlighted. Targeted.", "\u201cI can,\u201d she informed him. \u201cWhat did I say? You don\u2019t get to profit from murder and theft. I\u2019m taking it all back.

It\u2019s only fair that I\u2019m taking yours.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t do this!\u201d the project leader begged, wrapping his hands around each other. \u201cPlease! Please, don\u2019t.

Without it, our enemies will destroy us.\u201d", "\u201cMaybe they will,\u201d the alien conceded. \u201cOr maybe, they will look on you like you looked on these survivors. Broken and helpless, without recourse or assistance. Maybe they\u2019ll show you mercy.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ll kill thousands!\u201d Yuklan protested. \u201cAnd condemning millions more! It\u2026 it was only six lives. Are they worth all of this?\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d the Fallen hissed, her tones turning ragged and ugly. \u201cIf I can\u2019t save them, then I\u2019ll avenge them. To you, it was six lives,\u201d she turned her back, heading after the rest of her soldiers. \u201cTo me, they meant everything.\u201d It paused a moment. \u201cI\u2019ve started an overload in the vessel\u2019s primary power core.

The full first half is up for my patrons, but everyone else gets this teaser.", "~", "The Last Angel: Predator, Prey - 01", "The predator awoke to the taste of blood. It dripped down its throat, oily and salty and metallic and a mixture of a half-dozen other flavours. It opened its eyes, but there was only darkness and the stinging sensation of more wetness dripping down into its eyes. There was weight pressing down on it, reeking and warm. In a flash of realization, the predator realized what it was, where it was. The dead. It had been buried in the dead it had been buried while it was still alive it was covered in the dead it wanted out it wanted out get out get out now\u2026 ", "It started to panic, clawing and thrashing. It couldn\u2019t breathe and desperation lent it strength. The bodies piled atop it began to shift. A little at first, but more and more as the predator got more leverage. It got its arms free and began shoving and pushing, its legs kicking against the oozing, rotting substrate it was covered in. Finally, one of its clawing arms burst out of the press of bodies and into a cold openness. The predator dragged itself towards freedom. It pulled itself halfway out of the dead, sucking in lungfuls of frigid air. It vomited then, emptying its stomach of acid, bile and blood. Panting in the cold, it rolled down the side of the corpse pile, gathering its wits.", "It was alive. It had been left for dead, thrown away like refuse and sealed in this freezing chamber. The panic subsided and a new feeling rose as it surveyed its surroundings, looking at the corpses thrown carelessly about the room. The pile it had pulled itself from was the largest, but there were others. Dozens of bodies, perhaps more.", "A single thought pounded through the predator\u2019s mind as it dragged itself across the floor, smearing trails of blood behind it. The cold leeched away the predator\u2019s strength, but the thought kept it moving. It reached the nearest wall, leaving a bloody smeared handprint on the frost-coated metal as it pulled itself upright. The doors were locked, but that wouldn\u2019t stop it. It knew this room. There was more than one way out and the predator began to climb, the thought growing louder in its mind. It was a simple one. ", "Kill.", "~", "Agent Clark DuPont, Compact Intelligence Services, sighed as he adjusted the readouts on his personal scanner. He was looking through the offices outside one of the laboratory complexes on Vilga Orbital, a small space station officially owned by M\u00ean-an-Tol Biochemical Fabrications. Unofficially, there was no indication that that company existed anywhere in the sector outside of archives and datalogs. In truth, Vilga Orbital had been controlled by something a great deal more malevolent than a simple medical research company, which was why he was here.", "Most of the computers were locked down, a security protocol that he hadn\u2019t been able to circumvent yet. There was no one to get the code from, as the blood trails indicating where the previous occupants had been dragged away attested. Many other sections had been locked down as well and it was all he could to convince the computer not to begin a full data purge.", "His breath clicked through the respirator that covered his face. The air scrubbers were working overtime, but Vilga Orbital was still contaminated. The toxin should be almost inert, but Clark didn\u2019t want to take any chances.", "\u201cProblems?\u201d His partner, Investigator Ferma Sald Thrisk Reuz Genot inquired. She was sitting on the desk next to him, looking through a sheaf of flimsies and unsecured datapads. The Tribune was nearly a foot and a half taller than DuPont and weighed more than four times as much, but she moved with confidence and surety, if not grace. Like him, she was wearing a hazard mask to filter out the last traces of the contaminant, but her short muzzle and differently-shaped head required a different type of mask than Clark\u2019s own.", "\u201cJust more of the same,\u201d Clark observed. In his eyes, it had been a mistake to run this mission outside of normal channels. Actually, it had been a mistake to run it at all, but as a junior member of the largest and most efficient intelligence apparatus in the known galaxy, his opinion had neither been solicited nor welcome. \u201cThey\u2019re sloppy.\u201d From what they\u2019d been able to glean, \u2018M\u00ean-an-Tol Biochemical Fabrications\u2019 had been doing some kind of genetic research here. What kind of research was currently unknown. For that, they\u2019d either need to get into the sealed sections or have someone to interrogate. The latter was no longer possible", "\u201cThey\u2019re mercenaries,\u201d Ferma replied. \u201cSo that goes without saying.\u201d", "Clark grunted an agreement. He and Ferma were assigned to one of CIS\u2019s anti-Unbound divisions. They\u2019d worked together for five years, ever since Clark had been recruited. Back on Rally, Clark had been another example of the uncivilized mindset of humans: a troublemaker, always getting into trouble and facing a either dead-end career in whatever service wanted to hire someone with social assimilation scores as low as his, or volunteer to serve in the Compact\u2019s military forces, which was usually the last-ditch effort to encourage cooperation, appropriate social development and positive social attitudes. Humans were still a very young species and despite all the Compact had done for Rally over the past fifteen centuries, people like Clark still popped up. Evolution was a process that couldn\u2019t be rushed.", "Still, he hadn\u2019t been bad enough that chemical behavioural modification had been thought necessary, but it hadn\u2019t been off the table either. That was why, despite his skepticism, he had listened when the man in the nice suit had come to visit and told Clark of the potential that he saw in him.", "\u201cYou question everything,\u201d Aswarin Ganulas had told a younger Clark. The Prolocutor intelligence officer and the youth had been standing on Rally Orbital, the first and largest space station to be constructed over humanity\u2019s last colony, looking down on the planet below them. It was a sight Clark had never seen before. Until that day, he\u2019d not even been off-world. \u201cThat\u2019s gotten you into trouble. Authority, history, the decisions of the Compact.\u201d The Prolocutor had then turned to the younger human, his dark blue eyes glittering. \u201cBut there\u2019s more to you, isn\u2019t there? Others might have missed it, but we haven\u2019t. We see a lot in you, Clark. More than even you might think.\u201d That had been the beginning of a change for the young man. He had seen a different world and been given a taste of the possibilities open to him. The Triarchs themselves were said to have seen great promise in humans. One day, humans wouldn\u2019t be as primitive as they were. Until then, the Compact would there to guide and assist their development.", "Ferma gave her smaller human partner a nudge. Tribunes were a stocky species and heavily muscled. She\u2019d never had a Broken partner before and at the beginning, she\u2019d occasionally bowled Clark over with friendly gestures of camaraderie. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d", "\u201cJust the same complaints,\u201d Clark rephrased his previous comment. \u201cI wish we had prisoners. The whole point of our operation was to get inside one of the Red Hand\u2019s swamp nests. Then someone up the ladder decides, no, infiltrating just isn\u2019t good enough. We need to kill them.\u201d", "\u201cAnd now we\u2019re here,\u201d Ferma observed.", "\u201cRight, with a poisoned station, a cluster of mercs and a pile of bodies that can\u2019t tell us anything at all.\u201d Clark groaned in frustration, running his hands through his hair. His scalp tingled. The toxin affected the target\u2019s respiratory systems. Skin contact wasn\u2019t particularly healthy, but only after exposure to high concentrations of the compound. The trace amounts in Vilga Orbital\u2019s recirculated air would only be a problem if he took his mask off, but the itching tickling sensation was a constant reminder that this entire op was a shitshow.", "Before he could continue, the agent\u2019s comm pinged. Ferma\u2019s did as well. The Tribune answered first. \u201cThis is Investigator Ferma. Speak.\u201d", "\u201cYeah, this is Krenik,\u201d the voice of one of the mercenaries clicked through. \u201cWe\u2019ve got something\u2026 looks like a local failure in part of the air circ system around the cargo bays.\u201d", "Ferma rolled all four of her eyes. \u201cThen send someone to fix it.\u201d", "\u201cSure, we\u2019ll get on that. Just letting you know.\u201d", "The Tribune shut off her comm with a disgusted grunt. \u201cTen thrones that pisslicker was hoping one of us would take care of it.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t take sucker bets,\u201d Clark replied, still working at the computer. \u201cAnd that\u2019s another for the swear jar.\u201d", "Ferma said something in Oadan that was probably even more obscene, but Clark wasn\u2019t listening. He\u2019d finally been able to get through the final layer of security. The computer terminal began bringing up the last documents its user had been working on before the system had timed out and locked down.", "Maybe, Clark thought as he looked through genetic sequencing algorithms, charts, tables and spreadsheets that made no sense at all to him, maybe now we can find out what the Red Hand was doing here."]}

Built into the station\u2019s large central dorsal spine, they were a suite of rooms, including a kitchen, some offices and meeting rooms, a personal armoury and private elevator. There wasn\u2019t much that was specifically hers here, but it was comfortable and serviceable. It was decorated in the tradition of the Red Hand cells within the Veiled Reaches: graffiti art and the ironic use of the Compact\u2019s own posters encouraging compliance and obedience.

Bold colours, obvious symbolism and large text. Back home, there was one poster she\u2019d always liked. A pair of humans, one man and one woman, were trying to climb out of a thicket of thorns, up a steep rock face. Reaching down for them, leaning so far over the edge that he might fall, was a Tribune. Holding onto him was a Prolocutor and holding onto her, a Judiciary. Directing the rescue and urging the others on was a Triarch. There\u2019d been no obvious labels or pithy text. Just the symbolism. Even now, with decades and hundreds of light-years between her and her home, she remembered it.", "Just outside the window, the clouds of the nameless planet\u2019s atmosphere churned, the distant flickers of lightning bolts larger than cities creating pulses of muted light. A storm was forming. Hatchery One\u2019s meteorology estimated it would pass by at least a hundred kilometers from the station, so there was no imminent danger. It wasn\u2019t the gas giant\u2019s weather that had the woman\u2019s attention, anyways. Looking down at the rest of the shipyard, its reddish-brown bulk faded from the mists around it, Adrianna couldn\u2019t help but smile. Symbols, she thought.", "Hatchery One was a retrofitted gas mining and storage station, its ample cargo bays and refining facilities converted into factory complexes, work gantries and construction silos. A cast-off, taken and rebuilt into something greater. Arranged like the hours on an old-Earth clock, a dozen starships could be built or serviced simultaneously within the station, almost completely safe from the turbulent atmosphere outside. Almost. The station was only a few kilometers in diameter. With the space taken up by industrial nodes, crew quarters and cargo, only four of the wombs could accommodate anything larger than a light cruiser or frigate and even then, a portion of those larger vessels protruded outside the safety of the station\u2019s walls.", "The exposed ships\u2019 hulls and superstructures required more attention and care. Casualties on the work crews were always high, but Hatchery One\u2019s administration kept a close eye on external conditions. Work shifts were short, safety regulations were strictly enforced and if a storm began to move in, it was standard procedure to recall the crews and repair any damage to the ships and station afterwards than risk losing people. Despite the danger, morale among Hatchery One\u2019s workers was high. The foremen and supervisors would frequently have to order overly-dedicated subordinates to come in and stop trying to get a \u2018little more\u2019 accomplished before a storm hit.", "That motivation, that drive made Adrianna proud. The men and women here risked their lives not for money or a pat on the head and their masters\u2019 affection, but because they believed in what they were doing. Every ship that was built or refitted in Onza Cr\u00e8che was part of something greater, not just the accumulation of wealth or power. Each of those vessels was a symbol as much as the dedication of the workers here. They all fought, not just for wealth or power, but for a dream that none of them would probably live to see. Freedom. She\u2019d fought for that dream since the day sixty-three years ago when she\u2019d put a bomb in Commissioner Sath\u2019s limousine and sent him to his beloved Triarchs in pieces.", "He didn\u2019t think a Broken would hurt him.

It was the system that allowed men like him have power over others and abuse their position. It was the system that told her and everyone like her that they were less, that they were uncivilized, primitive creatures that needed the Compact\u2019s guidance. Killing Sath would have only have removed one evil man. There\u2019d be another to take his place. The only way to stop it was to make sure that there were no more people like him, ever.

Granted, that wasn\u2019t a lot, but she thought she was starting to get a feel for them. Although Brightest Night was larger and had been built by a different company in a different region of space and for a different role, it reminded her of Pale Liberation. Like the corvette, Brightest Night had been constructed with an eye for crew and passengers larger than humans and with different species\u2019 needs in mind.

As the most junior of the officers present, she and Allyria technically didn\u2019t belong here, but Brightest Night was often used to let newcomers to the Red Hand blood themselves while under the observation of more experienced officers.

They\u2019d not only survived that, but had been brought aboard Eisheth for an unexpected and secret mission. If that didn\u2019t lead to speculation and theorizing, then nothing would. People wondered who they were, even what they were. Allyria and Grace had been swapping stories as they heard them. They were the Red Queen\u2019s agents, there to evaluate and report on others. They had been secretly recruited from Rally, indicating that the Red Queen was about to start pivoting towards freeing her homeworld. They were representatives of whatever power Leblanc had made her pact with, or even that they were \u2018production models\u2019 to Leblanc\u2019s prototype. Regardless of how much of any of that anyone in the room believed, Grace and Allyria were under more scrutiny than any other recruits.", "Grace tried to mimic Allyria\u2019s outwardly stoic appearance, but the Verrish had an advantage in that if she also wasn\u2019t the right build for the seats, she was at least big enough that she didn\u2019t look like a child at her father\u2019s desk.", "The doors to the room whiffed open and Group Leader Brev\u2019tel entered. Grace, Allyria and the other officers rose to their feet. \u201cThank you all for your patience,\u201d Brightest Night\u2019s commander said, taking his own chair at the head of the teardrop-shaped table and his officers sat again. He was only a few moments late, but he seemed to have his species\u2019 intrinsic sense of punctuality. The Thoughtful was spindly even for one of his species, with dark patches under his large black eyes. Though he could simply have been fatigued, Grace had only been aboard Brightest Night for a few days, but she\u2019d heard the rumours that Brev\u2019tel was not well.", "\u201cWe will be reaching Jan-xhai\u2019s shock limit in less than an hour, so I believe it\u2019s time to discuss our mission,\u201d Brev\u2019tel announced as his officers reseated themselves. \u201cI apologize for the delay, but this mission is more delicate than usual and I wanted to ensure that we won\u2019t have any leaks. To confirm what you already know, we\u2019ll be conducting a commerce raid, albeit one different than you may have suspected.\u201d He gestured and the holographic projector in the middle of the table came to life, showing a blue giant star and the seven planets that orbited it.", "\u201cSectator te Neu,\u201d Brev\u2019tel said. \u201cDo you recognize this system?\u201d He was fond of calling on his officers like the schoolteacher he\u2019d once been.", "Allyria tilted her head towards the Thoughtful. She\u2019d been studying the region. \u201cKelkon. Twelve light-years from Jan-xhai. No habitable worlds, but a substantial orbital network exists to support the local industry.\u201d", "Brev\u2019tel smiled that thin, near-lipless smile his people had. \u201cCorrect.\u201d He adjusted a control at his console and the map zoomed further in, focusing on the system\u2019s second outermost planet Alcodas, a world somewhat larger than Jupiter, but various shades of blue, green and purple. It had thin, nearly invisible rings of ice fragments and dust particles. It, like the four other gas giants in Kelkon were extremely rich in helium-3. Kelkon was convenient to a number of worlds within the Idle Depths and the helium-3 harvested there fuelled fusion reactors throughout the sector. Gas mining and extraction from terrestrial surfaces was an ongoing process, with the bounty shipped to local refuelling stations for sale to visiting ships or readied for export throughout the sector. \u201cAs most of you know, we\u2019ve had issues with Kelkon in the past.\u201d There was a rustle of agreement at that statement.", "The Red Hand had been attempting to establish a greater presence in Kelkon for years. They had a few smuggling channels \u2013 bringing in contraband and anti-Compact literature to the workers and leaving with fuel, money and other goods \u2013 but the system was heavily patrolled by corporate defence forces as well as a token Security Force, under Column Leader Prime Tas\u2019vek. Both the Space Force and corporate militias were equipped for interdiction and interception duties and were quick to react to unexpected or unwelcome visitors. The insurgency\u2019s raids were often brief and if successful at all, only marginally so. \u201cHowever,\u201d Brev\u2019tel continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve recently come across some intelligence that changes our previous equations.\u201d", "\u201cI expect this information is time-sensitive,\u201d Ar\u2019killi, Brightest Night\u2019s Operations officer commented roughly. Each of the Worker\u2019s fingers was as thick as two of Grace\u2019s and she rapped them on the table to punctuate her statement.", "\u201cIt is,\u201d Brev\u2019tel confirmed. \u201cOne of our operatives in Kryzonim Nonterrestrial Extractions has acquired the timetable and manifest for one of the next convoys departing Alcodas.\u201d He made a final adjustment to his panel and the display shifted to a readout of ships, hull types, cargo and projected course. Twelve ships. Eight tankers filled with helium-3 and other elements for export, another four loaded with industrial goods. A pair of KNE destroyers protected the convoy. \u201cIt\u2019s a delivery for the shipwombs at Venporra, which means a lot of Space Force reactors are going to come online with that fuel.\u201d", "Tannin Korvul was the frigate\u2019s Security officer and the Pedlar leaned forward. When he spoke, the question wasn\u2019t directly to Brev\u2019tel, but to both the ship\u2019s leader and their intelligence officer. \u201cThe corporations guard their shipping schedules like a virgin\u2019s virtue, especially their government contracts. How did we get this information?\u201d", "The Thoughtful looked to his intel officer and tilted his head to the left in a gesture to proceed. The Didact straightened and turned to better address the other officers. \u201cA lucky break. Our operative was in the right place at the right time and managed to coax the information from one of the convoy\u2019s leaders. It\u2019s possible that it may be false or misleading, but command believes the reward outweighs the risk. I agree with their assessment.\u201d", "\u201cI do as well,\u201d Brev\u2019tel confirmed. \u201cI volunteered Brightest Night\u2019s services.\u201d", "Korvul considered that. \u201cUnderstood,\u201d he said at last, pressing his meaty paws together.", "Grace had done her research, too. Several different corporations had interests in mining the Kelkon system. To prevent \u2013 or more realistically, reduce \u2013 conflict between these concerns, the Compact had established economic exclusion zones. Officially, this was done in the interests of ensuring safe, secure and well-regulated operations. Unofficially, this was the equivalent of sticking squabbling children in separate sandboxes. The Compact generally kept a tight leash on its corporate citizens and for the most part, only the occasional hand-slap or strongly-worded reminder was necessary to keep the interstellar concerns behaving, but the Idle Depths were almost as far from the rest of the Compact as the Veiled Reaches. If one company thought it could eke out a competitive advantage by arranging for \u2018unfortunate accidents\u2019 to its rivals\u2019 ships and facilities\u2026 well, the frontier was a dangerous place.", "It was rare for the corporations to attack each other directly, but industrial espionage was common enough and if some useful tidbits of information just happened to find their way into the hands of an Unbound cartel who proceeded to use them against a company\u2019s rivals and competitors, well such things happened. Such collusion was not without risk. An indictment for criminal conspiracy was the least anyone caught would face. If the Red Hand was the cartel in question, the charge of treason was added. There was always someone willing to try, though.", "\u201cWe\u2019ll be going in with eyes open,\u201d Brev\u2019tel assured his staff, \u201cbut we are going in. We\u2019ll be rendezvousing with additional forces about four light-years outside Kelkon. Our objective will be to capture as many of these ships as possible. We\u2019ve got a lot of facilities and ships that could use that fuel and supplies. What we can\u2019t take, we\u2019ll destroy.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAnd if that means some Space Force ships go thirsty, then that will be terribly unfortunate. Now,\u201d he asked, looking directly at Grace. \u201cAre there any questions?\u201d", "~", "Nenkot, who had gotten into a bit of trouble as a younger man and so had yet to earn the \u2018Ar\u2019 prefix for his name, looked out the transport shuttle\u2019s window as it approached its destination. \u2018Shuttle\u2019 was a bit of a misnomer; the craft was large enough to ferry nearly a thousand construction workers across the system. It was currently stocked with just that many souls and their baggage, the newest delivery of technical personnel, engineers, supervisors and administrators to Galhemna\u2019s largest shipwombs.", "It was not the only shuttle to make that journey, either. Galhemna\u2019s manpower demands were ravenous and growing every day. Nenkot had heard that the system\u2019s talks with the federal government were going well. There\u2019d been some recent good news that seemed to make people think even more construction slots were going to be opened, though the Worker couldn\u2019t have said what had changed. Last he\u2019d heard, Galhemna was still bitterly fighting for those construction contracts. He\u2019d find out soon. That was part of the reason he was here.", "The Worker placed one three-fingered hand against the viewpoint. The thick, transparent metal was slightly cooler than the bulkhead. It was almost as strong as regular hull material, but more expensive. In a warship, any physical windows would either be too small to be a major weak point, or equipped with armoured shutters that would close as the vessel went to battle stations. A simple intrasystem personnel shuttle had no need for the latter and little reason to worry about the former, so it had actual windows for the convenience and comfort of its passengers and crew.", "Nenkot\u2019s hand was the size of many other species\u2019 heads and, should the mood strike him, he could simply close his hand around such a skull and apply only a portion of his strength to crush it like a hollow can. Workers were known for their strength, their endurance, their durability. They were an imposing species \u2013 apelike slabs of flesh as tall as Tribunes, with nearly-hairless thick rock-grey skin, dense musculature and strong bones. Denqor was a high-gravity world lashed by fierce weather and intense radiation. The people that had survived its brutal evolutionary winnowing could survive in conditions that even the hardiest of other species would find difficult to endure. It was little wonder that the Compact had decided to uplift the primitive, barely-erect sapient species and bring them the benefits of medicine, literacy and set them on their path to true civilization. Two and a half millennia hence, there were Workers toiling across the breadth of the Compact, awaiting the promised day that they stepped into the sun alongside their rulers. It was coming, they were assured and many worked all the harder to bring it about.", "Nenkot himself was an experienced zero-g welder. He\u2019d worked on stations and ships for nearly thirty years, ever since he was old enough to put on an EVA suit by himself. He loved the stars. He loved to work on the ships that would travel to new systems and the stations that, like him, drifted in the void. One day, he\u2019d told himself, he would get to fly one of them. One day.", "\u201cThere, you see, yes,\u201d Personnel Resources Liaison Otom-ebb-wola bubbled from behind Nenkot, breaking the Worker\u2019s reverie. \u201cWe are approaching the wombs now.\u201d", "So they were, a distant speck of light eventually resolving itself into something even a Worker\u2019s small eyes could see. Galhemna\u2019s Level-6 shipwombs were a complex more than a hundred kilometers across, filled with fabricator nodes, storage facilities, worker dormitories and slots for the production of leviathan-grade starships: battleships, battlecruisers, system monitors, heavy mining vessels and transports. He\u2019d been lucky to get this job. \u201cI see,\u201d Nenkot told the administrator. It was Otom-ebb-wola\u2019s job to ensure that the immigrant workers were processed efficiently and set up before being handed off to the shipwomb\u2019s foremen and supervisors. The Builder didn\u2019t think he was being patronizing, but he seemed to regard the Workers in his shift, and Nenkot in particular, as children that needed the obvious explained to them.", "\u201cMake ready,\u201d the supervisor announced over the intercom to the hundred-odd passengers on this deck of the shuttle. \u201cRemember to disembark at your designated gate, yes. There is no rush. No. Proceed to your quarters.  Work will begin tomorrow. Report to assigned sections and supervisors. Welcome. Remain seated for now, yes. Welcome. Galhemna is pleased. We are pleased to have you. The Compact grows. A good day. Be proud.\u201d", "Compared to the Worker, the Builder was like a child\u2019s toy. About five feet tall, with his rotund midsection, bulging eyes, arms that looked too long for his body and idiosyncratic speech, the Builder might seem hard to take seriously at first glance, but his species had extraordinarily sharp vision, exceptional dexterity and a preternatural aptitude for construction and design, abilities that had served them well when the Compact had raised them to a ruling member. They were the most recent success story of the Compact and how any of its client races, once they had proven themselves, would be deemed ready to take their place alongside the other civilized species in the greatest nation in the galaxy.", "Which was fine to say, but the Builders\u2019 elevation had been two thousand years ago. There were rumours about the Steersmen or even the Didacts being next, but those rumours had persisted since long before Nenkot had been born. Meanwhile, his people had been waiting for their chance nearly twenty-five centuries. Nenkot was tired of waiting. You couldn\u2019t rush evolution. The Triarchs knew best. Those words were a mantra that every Worker grew up with. He didn\u2019t believe them any longer.", "So when the woman with the clever eyes had come to him and offered him a lot of money, he had accepted. There was something going on in Galhemna, she\u2019d told him. Something that her associates wanted to know about and he was perfectly positioned to find out what. \u201cHow,\u201d he had asked, \u201cwill I know what you\u2019re looking for?\u201d", "\u201cOnce you see it, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have any trouble knowing,\u201d she\u2019d told him. \u201cYou know how to contact us if anything seems\u2026 interesting. Keep an open ear and your eyes wide.\u201d", "He could certainly do that.", "As the shuttle began to decelerate for its final approach, Nenkot watched his new home grow larger and wondered once again what he would find.", "~", "He was walking through Light of Judgement\u2019s corridors. He was walking through Invida\u2019s halls. He was walking through the body of the Nemesis. Sometimes it felt as if it were just one, sometimes it seemed to be all of them at once, impossible as that was. He was alone. He would have thought that there would be something more macabre. The bodies of the dead littering the deck, perhaps. But it was just him. ", "Almost.", "Something was following him, matching him step for step. It was always in his peripheral vision. Every time he turned his head, it moved to stay just on the edge of his sight, but he knew what it was. It wasn\u2019t hunting him. It was simply there, always there. Sometimes he would run, outpacing it, leaving it behind. It had no need to run after him. It always found him again. Eluding it was often worse than being followed, because he knew it was there and it was still coming, but he\u2019d still run. There were brief moments that he could think this time, he\u2019d gotten away.", "It always found him again.", "Sometimes he would come to a room. Invida\u2019s command center, the human warship\u2019s hangar concourse or Light of Judgement\u2019s command deck. He would reach out to open the door\u2026", "Most of the time he woke up there. Sometimes he did not. Sometimes, the doors opened.", "This was where he saw the dead. Past, present and future, they lay slumped over their consoles, crumpled on their floor and now recently crucified on the bulkheads, left like macabre wall hangings. Gore would squelch under his feet as he stepped inside. He could recognize each of the fallen, even the ones without faces left to them. He knew each of their names.", "Then and only then would his follower come close, standing just behind him. He could feel its presence like a physical weight pushing in, thickening the air and choking the breath from his throat. It would lean in, speaking from a lipless mouth. A goddess of metal whispered softly, every syllable a hateful purr. \u201cI did this,\u201d she would say. \u201cBecause you didn\u2019t tell them.\u201d", "Nasham\u2019s strength was coming back. It was said that a Tribune could survive almost anything that didn\u2019t kill them immediately and he was well on the mend. The radiation sickness had been the worst of his issues. He would still need anti-radiation treatments for the next several weeks, but he was well enough. He would be discharged tomorrow. He\u2019d seen several of the other survivors from Hala. Many were not doing well as he was, but the prognosis for most was good. They seemed to credit him for that. Yindre was being fitted with a prosthetic arm to replace the one she\u2019d lost. Sask might need one as well, but the doctors were more optimistic that they could regenerate his lost limb. \u201cIf not, hey,\u201d the young Janissary teased Yindre, showing her the stump of his left elbow. \u201cWe can be twins.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d the grenadier had replied, grinning at her squadmate. \u201cI don\u2019t plan on fucking my brothers.\u201d", "At least they\u2019re in good spirits, Nasham had thought, leaving them to toss amputee jokes and innuendo at each other.", "Vinsea had come to see him almost every day. The last two days she\u2019d been absent, but today she\u2019d returned, along with Bastion Leader Yunl\u2019ro.", "\u201cYou appear to be inordinately hard to kill,\u201d the Thoughtful said by way of greeting, returning Nasham\u2019s salute. \u201cYour dame Fortune must treasure you greatly.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not certain I\u2019d consider myself lucky, matron,\u201d Nasham said. He was sitting up in bed. Tomorrow couldn\u2019t come soon enough. He was ready to return to duty. Next to him, Vinsea was holding her datapad out, silently making notes as the Bastion Leader and Nasham spoke.", "\u201cI would,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro replied. \u201cWere it not for your actions, the heavy losses Pradesh\u2019s flotilla suffered might have been total and we would have no information on what happened in that system. Your mission appears to have been successful,\u201d she said with distaste, but her discomfiture was for the submissive\u2019s conclusions, not his efforts.", "Nasham blinked all four eyes slowly. \u201cThen you believe that the unclassified was one of Nemesis\u2019s?\u201d", "The Bastion Leader\u2019s eyelids twitched. It was a long tradition in the hunting forces not to refer to the human warship by its name. It was always \u2018the target\u2019, \u2018the quarry\u2019, \u2018the Wound\u2019. Partly out of security concerns \u2013 not every member of the crew or execution force would be fully briefed \u2013 and partly to deny their long-lived antagonist even the small dignity of a name. In the otherwise empty room, the former was no concern and the latter was simply another issue of Nasham\u2019s continued anthropomorphization of their target. The Thoughtful didn\u2019t bother to correct him. \u201cYes,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI do. It appears the Echo\u2019s analysis was accurate.\u201d There was a brief pause before she spoke again. \u201cDo you know why you\u2019re alive?\u201d", "Fate, was the first thought that came to mind, but Nasham didn\u2019t voice that opinion. \u201cNot really. The missiles hit. They should have destroyed us.\u201d", "\u201cCorrect,\u201d the Thoughtful told him. \u201cBut records show that the last moment, the missiles changed their attack vectors. Most of the destruction was limited to outside the Unbound sigil\u2019s central core. There was just enough left of the ship for the boarding teams to survive until rescue ships arrived.\u201d Her thin lips tugged in a small smile. \u201cA lot of people owe you their lives.\u201d", "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Nasham said. Something leaden settled in his liver as he realized ramifications of what the Bastion Leader had said. The last moment; the missiles had altered their targeting after the unclassified had received the Red Hand codes. It hadn\u2019t only recognized them, but it had responded to them. Triarchs protect us. He hoped, he prayed that that was something it had learned watching the terrorist fleets. If he hadn\u2019t been aboard Hala for the boarding action, he might even been able to convince himself of that.", "\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro agreed. \u201cBut more than if you had not reacted as quickly as you did.\u201d An orderly brought the long-limbed sigil officer a chair and she sat down next to him. \u201cWe\u2019ve reviewed all the data from the battle and we\u2019re interviewing survivors now. I wanted to take your report personally.\u201d She leaned forward. \u201cTell me everything that happened, Group Leader Submissive. Start with your arrival in 1893-Yiren. Then\u2026\u201d she handed Nasham her datapad. On it, was the personnel file of a dark-skinned and brown-eyed human male. It was the same man that Nasham had seen die aboard Hala. \u201cThen, we\u2019ll talk about him.\u201d"]}

Both polities are simply too large to be ruled directly and the Principality has Castellans that function exactly the same way as Compact governors, overseeing the affairs of an individual star system. Castellans can be chosen through election, selection, hereditary lineage or some other means based on the laws and decisions of the system in question.", "As this might suggest, the Principality allows more flexibility in its local laws than the Compact does. By and large, the Compact will not allow member systems to break federal law. Murder, for example, is a federal law. No system could get away with, say \u2018Hunt a Broken\u2019 sporting events or widespread lynchings. Even if the protected races are second-class citizens, egregious violations of their public image federal law would have the Compact\u2019s mailed fist going straight up the ass of the governor who allowed such a thing to happen.", "The Principality has a different view. There are two types of systems: federal, and incorporated. Federal systems are those that fall directly under the purview of the Principality\u2019s government and are subject to all federal laws and local (i.e. sector and oversector) statues that apply. An Incorporated system is one that is wholly controlled by a member race and is under their jurisdiction, not that of the federal government. For example, slavery is banned within the Principality. But a hypothetical member race might see slavery as an important part of their culture. In such cases, the Principality would advise said member race that in their home system and any other systems that they themselves colonize (with no federal assistance or aid \u2013 the instant the Principality at large forks over so much as one space dollar, that new system falls under federal jurisdiction. If you want funding from the central government, you have to follow their rules), they can make the laws whatever they like\u2026 and those laws mean precisely dick outside their little hugbox.", "To continue our example, let\u2019s say a member of our hypothetical slaver race is visiting a federal system and their slaves make a run for the nearest police officer and say \u2018we\u2019re slaves, help us!\u2019 Their owner would end up going to prison as they\u2019d have no legal defence whatsoever.  Or for another parallel, let\u2019s say we have Space Aztecs who are planning to celebrate something and they smuggle in someone to sacrifice. The sacrifice doesn\u2019t really want to have a date with Mr. Pointy Knife, escapes and asks for asylum. It would be granted and any requests to have them returned would be met with peals of laughter.", "It should be clear than that the Principality is more lenient towards the cultures and practices of its members \u2013 which isn\u2019t surprising, considering that many of those same members joined to avoid being annexed by the Compact, which will grind away any culture, tradition or belief system that might become a problem or threat to their order. As a consequence, to the nations seeking to avoid this kind of fate, any government intervention in their affairs would be seen as unacceptable and so the Principality does give its members a lot of slack in their internal matters and culture, but it draws a firm line at anything that goes on outside those members\u2019 borders. This is both boon and bane, since the Compact does like to point out the \u201cbarbarities\u201d that the Principality \u201callows\u201d, but the Principality also uses it to assure nervous newcomers that they won\u2019t be swallowed up with their identities lost by a much larger culture.", "The Askanj Principality, perhaps unsurprisingly, is styled on the practices of the species who originally formed it, the Askanj. Or as they are currently known, the Askanj-anj. Whereas the Compact has the Outer Council and the Inner Council, the Askanj have a House of Commons, House of Nobles and, technically, a royal family although they have little more than a ceremonial role in this day and age; most of the power resides with the Prime Minister, the Secretary-General and Parliament. At the time the Askanj moved out into space, they were a monarchy, though one more in the style of the modern United Kingdom. Encountering other civilizations further weakened the power of the crown, as non-Askanj species had understandable concerns about following an alien monarch, but less about being involved in a more representative style of government.", "Administration:", "The House of Nobles functions much in the same manner as a present-day House of Lords: examining and revising bills passed up from the Commons, looking over government proposals, debating and amending said bills and proposals. Normally, the Nobles cannot prevent bills from the Commons from becoming law, but it can delay their passing, or force the lower House to reconsider or alter the legislation.", "Each member species has at least one Noble representative, originally intended to ensure that they were adequately represented in the peerage, but as the nobility has increased in number, the power of these positions has decreased; currently the Ministers of their respective species that sit in the cabinet are the main voices for their civilizations. A position to the House of Nobles is not through election, but through selection of one of the peers of the realm. Selecting these individuals is one of the few duties that the sitting royal family has left, though this is usually limited to rubber-stamping the advice of the Prime Minister or a selection committee.", "In the Principality, nobility can be granted through noteworthy achievements: military*, scientific, social, literary, etc. and can be granted to one individual, or made into a hereditary title. Only those who hold these hereditary titles can be selected for a position in the House of Nobles. A title can also be stripped for criminal acts or otherwise dishonouring the position and/or the Principality.", "*ascending to a high rank in the Askanj armed forces automatically comes with a grant of nobility, but it requires exemplary service for that title to become hereditary, and thus the person holding it being eligible for appointment to the House of Nobles. Originally in the dominant Askanj society, only nobles were eligible for positions of higher rank. As that society became more egalitarian, that rule was kept but now every officer promoted beyond a certain point is made a noble, so the letter of the law is maintained.", "The Principality\u2019s House of Commons is the popularly elected component of their Parliament, composed of representatives from the various sectors. Major federal legislation \u2013 issues that affect the whole of the Principality \u2013 is introduced here.

He\u2019d focused more on his studies, graduating high school in the summer semester. Clark had applied to, and with Ganulas vouching for him, been accepted to the Academy. He\u2019d graduated as an officer in the Rally Provisional Space Force, but he hadn\u2019t remained there for long, quickly transferred into the Compact\u2019s intelligence service. Ferma had been assigned as his partner and the two had worked well together, pairing Clark\u2019s insight with Ferma\u2019s experience. They\u2019d worked to break up several minor smuggling rings, but DuPont had seen something his partner had missed. Pulling that thread had gotten them on the trail of the Waning Moon syndicate and they\u2019d managed to take it down. That success had led them here. The vacancy created by the fall of the Waning Moon had started a turf war across the sector as small-time Unbound clans attempted to step up and more established gangs tried to claim the Waning Moons\u2019 territory for themselves. The conflict had looked like it was going to turn ugly, but then it ended abruptly.", "Not through anything DuPont, Ferma or their colleagues had done, but for the same reason that rodents squabbling over a meal will stop once a larger predator approached. Clark would have liked to say that that was the CIS, but he would have been lying to himself. It hadn\u2019t been the Compact that had quelled the brewing gang war in the sector. It had been the Red Hand. They\u2019d seen the opening created by the Waning Moons\u2019 fall and they\u2019d moved in. Anyone that had quibbled over their presence didn\u2019t do so for long.", "Less than a century ago, there had been no Red Hand. It hadn\u2019t existed. Now, it was among the largest and widespread of Unbound factions in the galaxy, bringing together the disaffected, the opportunistic, the deluded and the insane under a banner of lies and truths so badly distorted that might as well have been falsehoods themselves. It should have been just another worthless, hopeless band of misfits and criminals, feeding off the scraps of whatever they could steal. Instead, the Red Hand had spread like an infection, growing from a small band of bold and bloodthirsty scum to the kind of organization that could build places like Vilga Orbital, all under the auspices of the Red Queen. Rally\u2019s greatest shame and the most eloquent proof of all that humans were still only a hair\u2019s breadth from barbarity. The Red Hand\u2019s bloodthirsty ruler and her deluded crusade had proven to the galaxy that Broken were not yet ready to take their place alongside the civilized races.", "There were still some on Rally who idolized her, seeing her as an underdog, or a noble warrior fighting an oppressive state. Clark himself had once thought along similar lines, mistaking rebellion for righteousness. As he took stock of the contents of this laboratory, he could only feel a deep, abiding shame for ever having thought that way.", "They\u2019d finally gotten access to the laboratory decks and the CIS operatives had gone in first. The rest of the mercenaries were sweeping Vilga for any trace of their new friend. So far, there hadn\u2019t been much luck. DuPont wasn\u2019t worried. Whatever he thought of their actions so far, tracking down a lone soldier was something right up the mercenaries\u2019 alley.", "He and Ferma had finally gotten through the security locks, gaining access to the sealed laboratories.

It had been quick, but bad. Clark stepped over the decomposing form of a researcher. There were still bodies here. Everywhere else on the station, the mercs had cleaned up their handiwork, dragging the corpses away and dumping them in freezing cargo bays. They\u2019d done that to be helpful. The forensics teams wouldn\u2019t think so.", "In point of fact, the station should already been crawling with them. Clark and Ferma had travelled to the station by shuttle.

His lips drew back from a mouth of widely-spaced pointed teeth as he mentally corrected himself. Not his ship, not really. His ship, the Fearsome Swoop, had been a decrepit old corvette staying one patch-job ahead of a complete breakdown. He\u2019d had no support, few allies and his successes had been so minor that the Compact had barely even noticed him. It had been his, though. His ship, his fight, his freedom. He and his people could go where they wanted and do what they wanted without anyone telling them otherwise. In some ways, he\u2019d felt that joining the Red Hand was trading one set of paternalistic authorities for another. It was supposed to be a rebellion, wasn\u2019t it? Why did there need to be so many rules?", "Many of his original crew hadn\u2019t shared that outlook, so for their sake \u2013 at least the ones who hadn\u2019t transferred to different commands \u2013 Tennit had grasped to this. He had to admit that the Red Hand had been good to him. He\u2019d been granted a new ship, given remit to hunt fat-bellied corporate and Compact transports and fight the fight he\u2019d always wanted to. Still, he had chafed under their regulations. He hadn\u2019t had to follow a chain of command on the Fearsome Swoop. He did what needed doing when he felt it needed to be done.", "Tennit had wanted to prove his worth, but it seemed no matter how many prizes he\u2019d taken, command\u2019s attention was always on someone else and he was constantly being overlooked. No longer, though. He\u2019d been a bit more forceful than he\u2019d intended during the briefing on Hatchery One, but he\u2019d caught the queen\u2019s eye regardless. He\u2019d never met her before that day.

It\u2019s volunteer only.\u201d", "He\u2019d accepted the assignment with barely a thought otherwise.", "Hekoma was a star system only a handful of light-years from Natuos, the seat of civilian authority in the Veiled Reaches. It was largely unremarkable, save for Juma\u2019s Jewel, the fourth world in the system. The planet was life-bearing, a rarity for the young, hot worlds created within the Black Veil. The planet itself was 92% water, with nothing more complex than algae and bacteria inhabiting its primordial seas. It was both a hotbed of scientific research and a site of luxury accommodations. Few planets in the sector were old enough to have ecosystems of their own and the island chains that fettered Juma\u2019s Jewel\u2019s blue-green oceans were home to both wealthy colonists drawn to a world that required little terraforming and researchers gleefully studying the development and evolution of primordial life.", "The planet itself was not the target, though Tennit would have gladly strafed a few of those islands, teaching their inhabitants that their wealth and privilege was no protection from the ire of those they\u2019d oppressed. Juma\u2019s Jewel had two moons: Included, a small lumpen wreck that was barely two dozen kilometers across and Flawless, a large terrestrial body nearly twenty-five hundred kilometers in diameter. Flawless was home to several mining networks and a biological/botanical research site that catalogued and studied genetic profiles from species across the sector. Ships were frequently visiting the facility, as the scientists would pay a moderate bounty for new genetic samples and biological prospectors were always on the lookout for unique or potentially useful species, just as geological surveyors looked for valuable ores and mineral deposits. It made a very good cover.", "Part of the research facility conducted a different type of research. It was a black site used by CIS\u2019s military wing to archive and analyze intelligence away from prying eyes, the visits of survey ships and hopeful genetic prospectors concealing data drops and information transfers.", "\u201cIt\u2019s likely to be defended,\u201d the Red Queen had told Tennit. \u201cBut this new execution force has shaken things up in the sector. Our information suggests that the site is vulnerable. We can\u2019t prove that, but our window of opportunity is limited. I won\u2019t order you, but if we can take this facility out, it will deal a blow to the Compact\u2019s intelligence gathering apparatus in the Veiled Reaches.\u201d", "Swiftly From Above had arrived in Hekoma two and a half days ago, pretending to be another biological prospector eager to cash in. They\u2019d passed the security checks without trouble. Hekoma was too small to have its own militia and local police forces were supplemented with a handful of private security cutters. There were a pair of drifts and some minor resource extraction operations in the outer system, but most of the activity was centered around Juma\u2019s Jewel. Jewel Orbital was the governmental and military hub for the system, fat-bodied station about the size of a heavy cruiser. There was a second, smaller citadel for civilian use, mainly used as a cargo depot and point of contact for space-to-surface (and vice versa) transport, a small shipwomb complex more for service and repair than construction and a smattering of privately-owned spaceships. Jewel Orbital was on the other side of the planet and the civilian facilities wouldn\u2019t pose any threat to Tennit\u2019s plans.", "The Space Force also had about a dozen ships present, mostly escorts on routine sweeps throughout the outer system. There were a pair of police cutters nearby, but they were tending to their own duties and showed no interest in Swiftly From Above, accepting its identity and modified transponder codes. The vessel had been hastily repainted to conceal its true heritage, its emission patterns altered and reactor tamped down to normal civilian operating levels. The nearest Space Force warship was a frigate, but its course was taking it away from Juma\u2019s Jewel and Tennit\u2019s retrofitted sloop.", "Everything seemed to going well. The oligarchs had no idea what Swiftly From Above really was. If they had, they would have never let it get this close. Now Tennit and his ship were on final approach to the research facility, awaiting clearance to enter close orbit for cargo transfer. Only instead of a shuttle full of genetic samples and flash-frozen organic specimens, the scientists and the intel officers they were covering for were going to get a quartet of seven-hundred megaton plasma warheads. The Harrimun thought little of the former; they were participating in the Compact\u2019s oppression. If they knew about the CIS facility, they were just as guilty as the spies and strategists there. If they didn\u2019t, they were ignorant dupes profiting from its presence all the same. To his mind, either possibility made them no better than his enemy.", "Tennit watched as a cargo shuttle lifted off from the surface. It was about a third the size of his sloop, on course to a stick-bodied freighter. The larger ship was swollen at both ends: engines at the rear, crew quarters and command at the front, its central spine carrying more than a dozen large detachable cargo pods, each almost enough to hold Swiftly From Above. The design was common: cheap, popular and flexible and ran the gamut from vessels barely largely than Tennit\u2019s old corvette to titan-scale monsters. The frequent changes to hull profile made temperamental FTL systems even more so. As the shuttle slid into a hangar barely larger than it was, the freighter came about in a slow, clumsy turn, starting to burn back out-system.", "The Harrimun shifted in his chair. It would be Swiftly From Above\u2019s turn next. The sloop had to keep its weapons powered down, but the engineers at Hatchery One had refitted its hangar to be a makeshift launch platform. Without targeting scopes and to prevent the missiles from being intercepted, they needed to get within a few thousand kilometers of the facility before launching them. Hence the deception. Once they were cleared for final approach, Tennit would turn that base into a radioactive crater. The young Harrimun waited for that signal. And waited. Minutes passed without a signal from the moon\u2019s traffic control.", "\u201cHail the facility,\u201d he ordered his comm officer. \u201cRepeat our request to approach.\u201d", "The message went out. A few moments passed. \u201cMorning Step, please stand by,\u201d the facility\u2019s docking officer answered, cutting the channel abruptly.", "\u201cStand by?\u201d Tennit blinked, his large triangular ears twitching. The other ships in the queue had been processed faster and they had been larger. He tapped his long fingers on one of his command chair\u2019s small displays. To accommodate his vestigial wings, much of the backrest and arms had been removed, leaving only a spinal brace, palm controls and personal displays. \u201cContact them again. Request an explanation for the delay.\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019re repeating their request for us to wait,\u201d Communications said. \u201cThey say there\u2019s some issue with the docking systems.\u201d", "Swiftly From Above\u2019s Leader looked over at his Scopes officer. \u201cNothing that we can see,\u201d she answered, \u201cbut it\u2019s possible.\u201d", "Tennit made a short, sharp echolocation click, an instinctive stress response. He ignored the flush of sensory data. Had the enemy discovered what they were up to? His ship had a falsified IFF and they\u2019d slipped through the standard security checks. If they\u2019d been detected, why let them get this close? Had Swiftly From Above somehow betrayed itself only recently, or was this all just bad timing?", "\u201cLeader,\u201d Scopes said. \u201cThe frigate is changing course.\u201d", "\u201cShow me,\u201d Tennit snapped, the officer dutifully bringing the image up on the main bridge display. The warship was coming about in an easy turn. It looked like an unhurried and innocent course correction, but he knew better. The frigate was going to turn behind Flawless and into the scope shadow the moon cast. From there, it could easily sweep about the moon on any vector and intercept Swiftly From Above. They knew. Somehow, they\u2019d discovered what he was. His mind raced, but he couldn\u2019t think of anything. It didn\u2019t matter now anyways. The police cutters were starting to move, too. They weren\u2019t as subtle as the frigate\u2019s leader, but it only confirmed what Isoran suspected.", "\u201cBring the main reactor\u2019s output back to normal levels,\u201d Tennit ordered. \u201cIgnite the secondary. Feed power to our guns and defensives systems. Ready the launch systems.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cTake us in.\u201d", "~", "\u201cReversion in two minutes,\u201d Navigation reported.", "\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Grace replied, running her fingers over the large armrests of her command chair. Brightest Night\u2019s secondary command deck was even more cramped than the corvette\u2019s main bridge, even with fewer officers and noncoms to operate its smaller stations and consoles. Secondary command centers were standard on actual warships, but on civilian ships, even combat-rated models, they were often an afterthought.", "She felt naked. All warships had two sets of heavy armour: their external hulls, which itself could be more than one layer, and a longitudinal internal core to protect vital systems such as main engineering, comp cent and command. Civilian combat ships did not have the latter. At most, they\u2019d have reinforced bulkheads or some additional armour plating around the most important areas, but the coverage wasn\u2019t complete and angled shots or deflections could still get through. Brightest Night was no exception. Originally, it had had only a few heavy bulkheads around command, engineering and several other decks. It had been refitted to have more complete internal armour, but it lacked the same coverage that ships like Nemesis and Eisheth had as a matter of course.", "\u201cOperations?\u201d she queried.", "\u201cAll stations reporting ready. Feeds to the bridge are all good. Everything\u2019s in the blue.\u201d", "\u201cWeapons?\u201d", "\u201cAll gun stations ready for combat,\u201d Allyria answered.", "\u201cGood,\u201d Grace said as she leaned forward. Assignment to a secondary command could be an honour or a punishment, depending on who did the assigning. Any attack that managed to take out a starship\u2019s primary command deck would likely cripple the vessel outright, but there was always the possibility that bad luck, hostile boarders, or some other circumstance would incapacitate the bridge crew but leave the rest of the ship largely intact. Space Force doctrine stated that during battle, an experienced officer should always be present. Traditionally, this was the starship\u2019s second officer, occasionally the first. This way, if contact with the bridge was lost, control would be quickly and efficiently transferred to someone who knew what they were doing.", "So in theory, Grace and Allyria finding themselves here was an indication of Leader Brev\u2019tel\u2019s trust. It could also be a way for them to see how Brightest Night fought without getting underfoot. Every station here mirrored the readouts and input from the main bridge, allowing auxiliary staff to stay up-to-date on battle situations. It could also be a way to put them somewhere out of the way. Some leaders used secondary command as a place to store troublesome or less-than-capable officers, keeping them out of the path of actual decisions with a fig leaf that their role was vital should the worst happen. Those leaders generally reasoned that, like Grace had thought, if the main bridge was lost, than the situation was so bad that anything done by the crew in secondary command could hardly make it worse.", "She didn\u2019t believe that was Brev\u2019tel\u2019s reasoning, but while the Thoughtful fought for the Red Hand, he still seemed to have some hesitation about the capabilities of the client races. His queen was of course, \u201cexceptional\u201d and didn\u2019t count. The Brute and Broken he\u2019d found himself with hadn\u2019t yet proven themselves to be on a similar level. She\u2019d already learned he liked to test his subordinates. Maybe this was another one.", "\u201cOne minute to reversion,\u201d Navigation called out.", "Operations ran a quick final systems check. Grace liked to see that; they weren\u2019t just relying on the data feeds, but confirming it for themselves.", "She glanced up at Allyria. The master weapons station was just behind and to her left.

The Chariot itself carried more than three hundred thousand crew. Each of the armada\u2019s twenty-eight battleships were crewed by another hundred thousand, and there were still more souls spread across all the vessels that made up the flotilla. Not everyone aboard those dozens of ships knew the exact nature of their quarry, of course. Not every sectator, pack leader, rating or noncom could possibly be cleared for that knowledge. All they knew was that they were part of an operation seeking a deadly threat to the Compact. Many rumour-mongers whispered the word \u2018Gravestone\u2019, but few knew what it actually was.", "The dozen and a half men and women in this chamber, though\u2026 they were the highest-ranked leaders in the execution force, squadron commanders and the seniormost starship leaders. Each one vetted by Force Command and entrusted with the Compact\u2019s secrets. They knew the nature of what it was they hunted and they knew the threat the human abomination posed. At least, they thought they were aware of the threat. As this briefing would show, it was something that even their pessimistic predictions had overlooked.", "\u201cIt\u2019s confirmed then,\u201d Group Leader Prime Vanta (and six names besides) grunted dourly. The Tribune was the master of Light of Judgement\u2019s deputy command, the battleship Praetor\u2019s Oath. His long fingers were always immaculately manicured and he wore several rings, an acknowledgement of an ancestry Yunl\u2019ro wasn\u2019t familiar with. Vanta had planned and conducted two operations beyond the Compact\u2019s borders, though he had never led one. He had been slated to do so, but his selection for this mission had pre-empted the assembling and launch of Expansion Fleet Vanta.", "\u201cThe analysis is still ongoing,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro replied. \u201cBut as of this moment, there appears to be a connection between our target and the Red Hand.\u201d", "The assembled officers murmured amongst themselves briefly. They had access to the same information Yunl\u2019ro had, but to hear it said aloud was different.", "Column Leader Ulin\u2019et, commander of the Defiant Sentries, one of the execution force\u2019s four battleship squadrons, blinked each large dark eye separately. He commanded the squadron that included Praetor\u2019s Oath, but Vanta was cleared for this meeting as well. Especially given his role as the master of the execution force\u2019s deputy. \u201cIf true,\u201d the Thoughtful said. \u201cThis would explain certain anomalies in the organization\u2019s operations and capabilities.\u201d", "\u201cIf true,\u201d Column Leader Ghenosta interjected. His command was Pentho\u2019s Justice, a squadron of battlecruisers. \u201cI have reservations about the validity of this data.\u201d The Prolocutor\u2019s large blue eyes glistened and he placed his hands on the table top. Prolocutors were an odd race. Classifying species across planets and systems was a Lakosan task and terms like \u2018reptile\u2019 and \u2018mammal\u2019 were more useful in common vernacular than scientific taxonomy. The prehistory of the Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s fellow ruling species was another such instance. Prolocutors had evolved from endothermic arthropods and appeared as a ghoulish cross between insectoid and mammalian heritages. Despite their physical appearance, they were an eminently civilized people. They also loved to talk. Ghenosta was such an example. He had also taken it upon himself to be become the \u2018seventh man\u2019 at these briefings. Yunl\u2019ro couldn\u2019t decide whether to be grateful for his well thought out positions of Betrayers\u2019 advocacy or annoyed at how much time he spent on them. Today, he seemed inclined to be mercifully brief.", "\u201cAs do I,\u201d Column Leader Fenlai added quietly. \u201cParticularly its source.\u201d The female Tribune shifted in her seat. She commanded the battleships of the Ashen Conquest. She was middle-aged and dark-skinned, a shade of brown so deep she was almost black. She also fervently hated all synthetic life with a depth and passion that made Yunl\u2019ro wonder about the suspiciously empty parts of her service record. Of all Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s subordinates, Fenlai had come the farthest to join the fleet, previously stationed at Anvil 731.", "\u201cMuch of the data came from Unspoken Right and the remnants of Column Leader Prime Pradesh\u2019s squadron,\u201d Ulin\u2019et pointed out mildly.", "\u201cThat is not the information I question,\u201d Fenlai retorted. She\u2019d never liked nor trusted Group Leader Submissive Nasham. To her, Nasham was irrevocably tainted by his association with the Wound and any information that came from him was automatically suspect. Her hatred for synthetic life tended to colour her perceptions, but so far in briefings and discussions to date, she had never said anything that was actually incorrect.", "Yunl\u2019ro held up her hand to quiet the argument. \u201cYou\u2019ve each been given an opportunity to review the data provided by Submissive Nasham and the analyses conducted by my strategists. The facts are this. Several days ago, Pradesh took fourteen ships belonging to the Veiled Reaches and my own command to strike at a suspected Red Hand facility. He destroyed more than a dozen terrorist ships, including one of the organization\u2019s command vessels. At this point, an unclassified vessel pretending to be a freighter attacked his forces and inflicted severe losses before withdrawing. It is highly likely that this unclassified was constructed by the Wound, probably within the Black Veil.\u201d her nostril slits flared. \u201cThere are two sets of implications to this. The first is that, as CIS operatives have suspected for half a century, there appears to be some sort of alliance between our adversaries. The second-\u201d", "\u201c-means that the Echo\u2019s analysis was correct,\u201d Column Leader Prime Xi\u2019kanis, mistress of the Golden Shields squadron, put in, the Cavalier\u2019s expertly-manicured fingers winding around each other. Her quills rippled. \u201cThe Wound has a shipwomb, as we\u2019ve always feared.\u201d Proving that had always been difficult. The machine had attacked the Compact for two millennia, occasionally disappearing for decades, even centuries before returning to strike again and again until it was injured so badly that it was forced to withdraw once more. No trace of a construction facility had ever been found and current consensus was that the AI was so wracked with hate that it focused all of its effort on repairing itself before attacking again. Before it had gone renegade, the Echo\u2019s finding implied that this was yet another deception the machine perpetuated.", "Fenlai made an agitated grunt. Surprisingly, she had said little on the validity of the Echo\u2019s information. Yunl\u2019ro suspected that the column leader was caught between her distrust of anything the platform had said and her refusal to underestimate something as treacherous as their target. \u201cThat confirmation is useful,\u201d she said instead. \u201cThis execution force,\u201d she bobbed her head slightly in acknowledgement of Yunl\u2019ro, \u201cwas assembled and launched on the assumption that those facts were correct.  We have learned that they are. Somewhere in the Black Veil, the bitch-thing has a home that needs to be burned to the ground.\u201d Fenlai continued speaking, though she dipped her head in a gesture of respect, indicating that her next words were not a challenge to the Bastion Leader. \u201cOur ships are at anchor instead of pushing deeper into the nebula. We should be seeking out this vessel and whatever birthed it, not letting ourselves be concerned with,\u201d she gestured dismissively, \u201cdistractions.\u201d", "\u201cOur scouts are already forging ahead into the nebula,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro answered. \u201cWe have time enough for both. You said that you questioned some of this information. What is it?\u201d", "Fenlai blinked her lower eyes. \u201cThe Red Hand are parasites and scavengers,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cTheir attacks have, yes, swelled after the Wound\u2019s predations, but I see opportunism, not collusion. They have acted in a similar manner when the Jackals or others have struck at us.\u201d She brought up a tangle of documents on her display. \u201cRecovered records and interrogations have told us that \u2018Measure Twice\u2019 showed no obedience to the Red Hand in 1893-Yiren. It refused to leave the system, but it showed no allegiance to its allies. If it had fought with Hala, the Unbound would have escaped intact. It did not.\u201d", "\u201cThe Scar dropped its guise to come to the aide of the final Unbound freighter,\u201d Column Leader Brenth (and seven names besides) pointed out, his Oadan upper-class accent a contrast to Fenlai\u2019s middle-class Navastaro patois. The unclassified warship had been tentatively named as Scar-class, not only as a reference to its presumed heritage, but for its actions in 1893-Yiren. \u201cIs that not allegiance?\u201d", "\u201cAllegiance, or opportunism?\u201d Ghenosta interjected, repeating Fenlai\u2019s assertion. \u201cIt killed five of our ships, then turned on Pradesh and his remaining assets. It also fired on Hala and several other wrecked Unbound. I must agree with my esteemed colleague\u2019s objections. The behaviour of the unclassified does not match those of a supposed ally to the Red Hand.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Fenlai added, pre-empting the next objection from her colleagues, \u201cit altered its attack on the sigil. A battle dog may not bite a hand that offers it food, but if its master says to, it will still kill the bearer.\u201d Fenlai tapped one finger on the table\u2019s surface. \u201cThe Red Hand are vermin, but I cannot believe even they would accept the aid of a synthetic intelligence. There is treason and then there is heresy.\u201d", "\u201cThey may not know,\u201d Ulin\u2019et suggested. \u201cIf I recall correctly, even the Red Queen\u2019s former lover admitted that she keeps secrets.\u201d", "\u201cAll the evidence of this collusion is circumstantial,\u201d Fenlai insisted.", "\u201cWhat are you suggesting?\u201d Xi\u2019kanis asked the Tribune column leader. She reached back behind her left ear and ran a thumb along several of her quills, a nervous tic. She disliked disharmony amongst her fellow senior officers. \u201cThat this was a coincidence?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m suggesting that the Scar was a battle dog heeding its masters\u2019 command.\u201d Fenlai replied. \u201cIt was there on orders that had nothing to do with any collusion with the Red Hand. We don\u2019t need to convince ourselves that our target is responsible for every rustling bush or broken twig in our path.\u201d", "\u201cThat is a possibility,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro said. \u201cAt the moment, we have too little information to know what happened. As to whether or not the Red Hand has a connection to our quarry, I believe you are overlooking an important piece of information, Column Leader.\u201d", "\u201cOur emissary\u2019s identification of one of the Broken?\u201d Fenlai scoffed. \u201cWith respect to yourself and all appropriate deference to the submissive,\u201d she said that word with just enough bite to make her opinion of Nasham clear. \u201cI believe that his experiences have clouded his judgement.\u201d", "\u201cFacial recognition has confirmed the identification to a very high probability. That is Convert-Citizen Marcus de Vries,\u201d Column Leader Daskren (and six names besides) said. The other Tribune was an old man, over two centuries old. He\u2019d been snatched from the cusp of his retirement for this mission. He lead another battleship squadron, the Brilliant Wrath. He spoke little, preferring to listen to his younger colleagues and only speak when he felt it necessary, rather than for the sake of hearing his own voice.", "\u201cAs much as can be determined from a few seconds of footage from a Janissary suit camera,\u201d Fenlai insisted. She stabbed one finger against the table. \u201cLet us not forget that our emissary completely fell apart after his experience on Invida and even now his mental health is questionable. That Broken could have been pale and female and he still would have said he recognized it.\u201d", "\u201cBroken are atypically limited in phenotypic expression,\u201d Ulin\u2019et conceded. \u201cTheir multiple near-extinction events have created multiple genetic bottlenecks. We lack a full database of every real or potential Broken defector, so it is possible that this individual is simply physically similar to the convert-citizen.\u201d", "\u201cThat is a very thin reed to clutch,\u201d Daskren retorted. He had spent much of his career cleaning up sectors that the Expansion Forces swept through, striking down the opportunists and Unbound that sprung up like weeds after the departure of the Space Force\u2019s fleets, before the Compact could tighten its hold on the region. In recent years, he had more and more personally encountered the Red Hand. He had always disliked Broken. Learning what they had created had only made that dislike more pronounced. Out of all of them, he was the most likely to support greater sanctions and control of Rally. \u201cThe Red Hand\u2019s queen is Broken. The Wound was forged by the Broken. It was last seen sniffing around their world and now, a Broken that just so happens to look like one of those on Bequeathed was found aboard Hala?\u201d He placed his hands on the table and leaned forward. \u201cThis is not coincidence. This is collusion. I have always said that the Broken needed to be watched. They\u2019ve done nothing to stop the \u2018red queen\u2019, they snap at our hands like ungrateful hemlin and their greatest accomplishment is creating an abomination. A neverborn. They are probably supporting terrorists and the Wound. We should-\u201d", "\u201cEnough,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro interrupted, re-taking control of the conversation. \u201cI have heard your arguments and opinions. There is merit in remaining skeptical,\u201d she said with a acknowledging tilt of her head towards Ghenosta and Fenlai. \u201cIf we let our biases blind us, we will be going into battle the same way. This information is still being studied and it will be passed along to those responsible for watching and dealing with the Red Hand. I appreciate your input on this matter. I can understand thinking that not even terrorists would treat with heresy, but the evidence must be followed, no matter where it leads us. That, if nothing else, separates us from our enemies.", "\u201cNonetheless, Column Leader Fenlai does have a point. Our remit is not to engage terrorists. Our mission is to explore the Black Veil, determine what, if any, assets the Wound has in this region and neutralize them. While I personally feel there is enough evidence to consider the Red Hand as part of those assets, our objectives are unchanged. We will continue to evaluate the data we have. You and cleared members of your staff are welcome to submit your own thoughts.\u201d", "She saw Ghenosta stir slightly. \u201cYes, column leader?\u201d", "\u201cHas there been any further determination of the unknown shockpoint?\u201d One way or the other, every ship in 1893-Yiren at the beginning of the battle between Pradesh and Jackson had been accounted for. After the withdrawal of the surviving vessels of Group Three, the Scar had departed. Before doing so, it had destroyed most of the scope platforms Pradesh\u2019s ships had deployed. Several of those it had \u2018overlooked\u2019 had been contaminated with infective programs. It said worrying things about the efficiency of the Scar\u2019s augurs, but it was not omniscient. It had missed three platforms, two of which had picked up what could have been a small shockpoint, dangerously deep in-system. There was no indication of what had left \u2013 or arrived.", "\u201cNot as yet. It may have been the pinnace launched from Hala, or it could have been another unclassified.\u201d Something watching us right now, Yunl\u2019ro thought sourly. Or another \u2018child\u2019 run to tell its mother what happened. \u201cWe will continue to sweep local space, but without further contact, we will quit this system as scheduled and continue into the nebula. Now, unless there are further objections, Strategist Tomek\u2019ip and his division have some further analysis of the Scar\u2019s capabilities to share\u2026\u201d", "~", "\u201cBreak, break now!\u201d", "Grace clutched the arms of her command chair as Brightest Night clawed about in a desperate attempt to open the range between itself and its attacker. Her eyes were glued to the main display, watching as a salvo of hostile missiles bored towards her.", "Everything had started off well. Brightest Night had rendezvoused with three other ships; another pair of vassa anka: Skincutter and Burning Sigil, and the Disturbed Hive, a modified heavy freighter. A normal pirate raid would try to seize one or two of the freighters, put prize crews aboard them and escape before retribution arrived. The crews, ships, and cargos would then be ransomed back, though it was not uncommon for some pirate gangs to keep some of their haul of hulls, goods and flesh for their own use.", "Though the Red Hand eschewed the flesh trade, they often claimed both cargo and prize vessels to bolster and supply their fleets, but this raid had greater ambition than one or two merchantmen. Disturbed Hive was an assault barge, its storage bays refitted into launch platforms and cargo pods modified into short-range assault craft. The vessel\u2019s interior was packed with soldiers. While its three comrades would distract the convoy\u2019s escorts, Disturbed Hive would attack the freighters themselves, its parasite craft deploying dozens of boarders onto each ship. More than enough to overwhelm whatever security teams the corporate-owned ships carried and take the lion\u2019s share of the convoy.", "The insurgent forces had arrived right on time, the four of them facing down exactly what their intel said was coming: a dozen freighters and a pair of light destroyers.", "\u201cEnemy escorts moving to intercept,\u201d Allyria had said as she looked over the tactical readouts on her display. The corporate defenders had accelerated to meet the attack, Skincutter and Burning Sigil moving to meet them. Brightest Night set a course that would allow it to support either its gunship counterparts or soften up the freighters should Disturbed Hive require some additional fire support, the assault barge following slowly in the corvette\u2019s wake.", "Leader Brev\u2019tel would be just now sending a request to the convoy to heave to and prepare to be boarded. A pair of destroyers, even corporate-rated ones, would be an unpleasant challenge for most Unbound, but each of the three vassa anka matched the destroyers in firepower, though they sacrificed armour and systems redundancy to pack in that much weaponry. Their missiles were also shorter-ranged with less effective penetration aids, but the Red Hand\u2019s commanders had learned well the lessons of void warfare. A battle that might otherwise favour the convoy\u2019s defenders was much less certain in outcome.", "The escorts might even decide to stand down once they knew who they were facing. The Red Hand was known for retaliating against companies that fought against it too hard. An interstellar corporation might have no hesitation in squelching a minor, bothersome pirate cartel, but getting into a shooting war with one of the largest Unbound syndicates in the galaxy was bad for the bottom line. Ransoms and insurance payouts were much cheaper.", "Grace listened to the stream of orders and status updates from the bridge. Skincutter and Burning Sigil had separated, each angling towards a different flank of the convoy, positioning themselves to rain missiles down on the transports in the hopes of crippling them or breaking up their formation and leaving them easier pickings.", "Disturbed Hive and Brightest Night came in straight at the convoy, a more direct threat but one that the transports might be able to hold off on their own. Three avenues of attack. Two escorts. The KNE commander had to decide where to put their vessels. Grace watched. She ran her tongue over her lips, her throat dry. Something was bothering her. It was a niggling, gnawing sensation. It was just nerves, she told herself. This was her first battle without Red.", "The KNE commander made their decision, much quicker than Grace had expected. Each destroyer peeled towards one of Brightest Night\u2019s counterparts. Now, every missile Skincutter and Burning Sigil threw at the convoy was one less to threaten the destroyers closing on them. The corporate ships leaders were imposing a choice on the Red Hand\u2019s commanders: stand and fight a potentially superior foe, or break off and risk their prizes slipping away.", "\u201cHe\u2019s trusting a lot to the convoy,\u201d Allyria noted. Her eyes narrowed and she made a small tsst of consideration.", "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Grace asked, picking up on her lover\u2019s mood.", "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Allyria replied, but she didn\u2019t sound convinced.", "\u201cGuns,\u201d Grace said firmly, tilting her head towards the Verrish\u2019s position. \u201cReport.\u201d", "\u201cThe escorts\u2019 response was fast,\u201d Allyria said. She ran her tongue over her pointed canines, her tintas stirring. Back at the Academy, she\u2019d been cycled through starship Tactical training, though she and everyone else had always known that she would end up being transferred to the Janissary Corps. Brutes had no place on a starship\u2019s bridge, the saying went. They were too aggressive, too predatory, too \u2018scream-and-leap\u2019. Their instincts, their natures made them better suited for ground combat but the instructors and confessors had let her pantomime the choice, as if the decision of where to serve had ever really been hers. \u201cFaster than I\u2019d expect from corporate leaders.\u201d", "Grace frowned, looking back at the telemetry. Allyria was right. Even accounting for the time lag, the destroyers had responded quickly, nearly on par with how actual military officers would have reacted. Either those ships were captained by former Space Force officers, or\u2026", "Or what?", "Her frown deepened as she shifted the focus of her attention from the escorts to the freighters. Twelve of them, just as expected, arranged in a loose, hollow diamond formation. Something about that bothered her. She listened to the reports from her junior officers as she scanned through the telemetry, running it back and forth. There was something familiar about it, but she couldn\u2019t have said what.", "Maybe it was nerves after all.", "\u201cScopes,\u201d Grace said. \u201cDo we have any readings from the middle of that formation?\u201d", "\u201cNo, matron.\u201d", "Grace kept herself from tapping her fingers on the arm of her chair. Nemesis and Eisheth would have already been pushing a recon shell into position to do just that, but civilian vessels carried very few sensor drones. Their uses were largely limited to military and scientific roles, neither of which were commonly performed by millions of private-owned starships used throughout the Compact. Compared to a starship, sensor platforms were individually inexpensive, but in the numbers necessary for use by a modern military, they became a sizeable investment. The Red Hand produced them in a slow trickle, often built individually by small workshops and garages. Brightest Night had only four drones and it was using them to augment its limited ship-based augurs.", "On the main screen, the destroyers had pulled away from the convoy, their missiles chasing after Skincutter and Burning Sigil, who deftly pulled away, kiting the escorts after them. If either destroyer tried to go after Brightest Night and Disturbed Hive, the raider would rush in at the convoy themselves. The comm waves were full of KNE\u2019s requests for assistance. It would be some time before even the nearest support ship heard their messages, let alone responded.", "The young woman shifted in her too-large chair and bit her lip. She watched the destroyers again. They\u2019re letting themselves be pulled too far out, she realized. They should be staying closer to the freighters, forcing our raiders back, but still keeping our barge from getting too close. The destroyers\u2019 leaders either didn\u2019t realize how far they were being drawn out \u2013 which was incongruous with their earlier actions \u2013 or they didn\u2019t care.", "Grace felt her eyes returning to the convoy\u2019s arrangement. Ships couldn\u2019t pack themselves too tightly together \u2013 their own drive wakes would prevent that but it seemed to her that the formation was a little too open. Nothing obvious, nothing really worth commenting on. A dozen reasons for it came to mind right off the top of her head. Giving themselves space to turn and run, a lack of trust in the piloting skills of someone there, simple sloppiness, inattention or simply not realizing that they could tighten their ranks.", "\u201cTactical,\u201d she said. \u201cAnalysis of the convoy\u2019s positions?\u201d", "\u201cNonstandard,\u201d Allyria reported back. Most convoy formations were intended to provide mutual support, with the most valuable ships at the center of any defensive posture. Each of these vessels carried a small fortune in helium-3 and industrial goods, yet none were moving to take shelter among their fellows. They should also be starting to see a slight breakdown in morale. Minor fluctuations in course and acceleration as their leaders tried to decide whether to abandon the convoy and run for it, others adjusting position to take greater benefit of the other ships\u2019 defences. Their discipline was good. Almost too good for daylight-hour captains and crews. Her tintas twitched and a feeling of unease grew. \u201cDispersed more than I\u2019d expect,\u201d she continued, echoing Grace\u2019s own thoughts. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they think they\u2019re doing. I don\u2019t know if they do.\u201d", "\u201cThey probably don\u2019t,\u201d Operations suggested. \u201cTheir escorts have been pulled out and they\u2019re facing attack and boarding. Their leaders are probably too busy screaming at each other and demanding support to notice what their ships are doing.\u201d", "\u201cHmm,\u201d Grace mused. That was likely. A Red Hand attack had to qualify as worst-case scenario for many merchant officers and crew in the sector. Still, she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling eating at her.", "Brightest Night had entered missile range, but Brev\u2019tel held fire. Missiles were not precision weapons. The goal was to take as many ships as possible, not leave a field of burning, irradiated hulks. Grace listened as the bridge\u2019s communications officer once again demanded the freighters stand down to be boarded. No one responded. The convoy was going to try to run for it. They started to turn at last, finally realizing that no one was going to save them. The heavy loaded-down freighters heeled about with a nominal amount of coherence, multi-kilometer ships frantically changing their courses. Grace narrowed her eyes as she studied the telemetry. She watched, almost feeling her distant teacher\u2019s crimson eyes on her. She could practically hear Red\u2019s voice.", "What do you see?", "None of the transports were crossing through that open middle space in their formation, not even the ones closest to Brightest Night and most likely to receive the brunt of its fire. One of the planetward freighters was burning its thrusters hard to keep from drifting through the middle of the convoy as it turned. It could have been panic. It might be smoke and mirrors that she was conjuring up, seeing things that weren\u2019t there in a bid to make herself useful.", "Allyria made a soft contemplative chirr. She\u2019d noticed the odd behaviour too, but she didn\u2019t know what it meant either. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of space they\u2019re leaving,\u201d she commented.", "\u201cEnough to hide another ship,\u201d Grace said with a flash of realization. Sol. Bastion Leader Renan\u2019s final bait. Eight battleships to serve as picadors and a last test of the wounded Nemesis before Redemption of Sol and the rest of the armada descended. Those eight warships hadn\u2019t been alone; they\u2019d brought with them an equal number of cloaked destroyers. Somehow from the impossible melange of data and emission patterns, Red One had noticed and prepared a counter. This wasn\u2019t the same, of course \u2013 the AI had seen what she had seen at hundreds of millions of kilometers through jamming, distorted sensor returns and from a formation well within standard dispersal patterns. Grace was watching, with minimal time lag, openly aberrant behaviour.", "Shrouds, cloaks, stealth systems \u2013 the terminology varied but the effect was the same, an interlinked system of various technologies that could hide all but the largest starships from detection. It was not perfect. A shrouded vessel was blind and helpless. If it used too much power, it could be seen. If it moved too fast, it would betray itself. The technology was situational and it was the one area that the Principality was leading the Compact, but the Space Force still used it frequently. This intelligence just happened to fall into our laps, didn\u2019t it? Suddenly, the destroyers\u2019 actions made perfect sense. They\u2019d been expecting this. They were trying to invite an attack on the convoy itself.", "Grace slapped her chair\u2019s comm. \u201cAuxiliary command to bridge! This is Proctor. I think there\u2019s a shrouded ship inside that convoy. I say again: high likelihood of stealthed hostiles ahead.\u201d", "There was a pause, then a request for clarification. Grace rushed through an explanation. She didn\u2019t say anything about Sol, but she made her case as quickly as possible. Every second wasted was one Brightest Night got closer to whatever was lurking ahead. There were agonizing moments of back and forth, of silence from the bridge. Grace knew they were weighing the words of a \u2018war-virgin\u2019 against the possibility of an ambush.", "Seconds. More seconds and moments spent as the organic crew debated, deliberated, analyzed and finally came to a course of action. With Red and Echo, the deliberations would have been over in less than a heartbeat. Grace bit her lip harder, casting an anxious glance at Allyria. Still more seconds passed. Missile range was dwindling. They were coming up on extreme-range for direct-fire weaponry. Then, she felt Brightest Night beginning to pull away. \u201cAcknowledged,\u201d the first officer answered. \u201cPrimary agrees. Withdrawing now. Readying missiles.\u201d", "Grace felt a surge of relief, accompanied by an equally strong hope that she hadn\u2019t just torpedoed this mission. Both emotions lasted forty-two seconds.

Attatan Khin were heavy variants, nearly light cruisers. It probably matched all four Red Hand ships in firepower. Against Brightest Night, it might as well have been a battleship. The frigate didn\u2019t bother asking for surrender. It opened fire.", "Missiles and railfire lashed at Brightest Night as the vassa anka heeled away from its attacker, but if the frigate\u2019s ambush had been spoiled, it had still been watching Brightest Night close, planning its attack and readying firing solutions. The corvette\u2019s command crew were still trying to react to the situation. Missiles detonated around Brightest Night as the frigate closed. There was barely enough time to engage them. Scopes reported a massive EM surge as the Attatan Khin\u2019s large prow-mounted railgun fired, the first shot missing the corvette by just over twelve thousand kilometers.", "Grace\u2019s heart pounded in her chest.

A new species, a new interloper aboard his citadel. \u201cThus do all foes of the Compact perish,\u201d he told the insect, grinning slightly in self-mockery. It was already dead and had been for some time. No serious collector pinned live animals.", "The doors to his office opened and his aide came in. She paused in front of his desk, looking with mild disdain at his latest prize. Vn\u2019zamos was a Cavalier and something of an anomaly. Her people preferred the cosmopolitan inner worlds of the Compact and as a people, they were not fond of travelling beyond them. They were no less loyal to the Compact than any other ruling species \u2013 perhaps even more so \u2013 but it was rare for them to leave the most civilized sectors of their nation behind, rarer still for them to join the Space Force. Kemk had found Vn\u2019zamos to be an efficient and dutiful aide, even if she had chased away two of his last three stewards. The Cavalier was a very exacting woman and she took anything less than the best for her superior to be a deliberate insult, particularly when it came from the lesser species. She had never said anything about his hobby, but Kemk knew it was an oddity that she considered to be beneath his dignity. For his part, he enjoyed occasionally tweaking her sensibilities. \u201cHave you seen this before?\u201d he asked, lifting his latest prize up to show Vn\u2019zamos.", "Her horizontal pupils twitched away from the insect. Red eyes, turning orange around the black pupils. Cavaliers were as to Thoughtful as Brutes were to Broken. They were a tall, lanky species with round heads and long necks.  They were not bald as the Thoughtful were, though. Instead, they had a mane of quills, shorter and finer than those of Pedlars, with leaf-shaped teeth intended for snipping and slicing. \u201cA new one, patron?\u201d Kemk\u2019s aide was always painstakingly formal. The last time someone had used the local sector slang kih to address him, he\u2019d thought Vn\u2019zamos would burst a blood vessel.", "\u201cYes, very new. Pack Leader Tunak Frenil Sarisi Nolon acquired it for me.\u201d", "Her eyes flickered as she struggled to place the name and came up short. Like the Didact species, Vn\u2019zamos herself had an eidetic memory. It was part of what made her such an effective aide. \u201cI see. I take it there\u2019s no need to enact any new quarantine procedures?\u201d", "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Kemk replied as he set the pinned insect amongst his most recent collection box. \u201cThis fellow might even be beneficial. Something to gnaw on all the other little stowaways we get.\u201d", "\u201cI see,\u201d Vn\u2019zamos repeated. She waited until the Bastion Leader had put the box up on the shelf with the others. \u201cA notice from Hekoma. There was a Red Hand attack in the system.\u201d", "\u201cAnother?\u201d Kemk grunted, his mood souring. There had been a flurry of terrorist activity in the past few weeks. Bombings, attempted assassinations, void raids and more. Haphazard and ill-prepared, most of them had floundered or ended badly for the Unbound\u2026 as this one had. A modified sloop had attacked the CIS outpost on Flawless, but it had been shot down by the base\u2019s defences before it could cause any serious damage. That mollified him, though he was annoyed that the vermin had managed to learn of the outpost\u2019s presence. It would have to be moved.", "\u201cI think we can safely say that they\u2019re lashing out at us,\u201d Vn\u2019zamos suggested. That possibility had come up in discussions as news of these attacks trickled in to Galhemna.", "\u201cI believe so,\u201d Kemk replied. Without their Crusade Commander, the Unbound were off-balance. These attacks all lacked their normal preparedness. \u201cTheir command structure must be in complete disarray,\u201d he mused. Everything he was seeing reeked of a lack of coordination. Blind, angry lashing out from cells and ship leaders that didn\u2019t have anyone to tell them no or put a semblance of order on these attempts at retribution. They were bleeding themselves far more than his forces. That was another small bonus, even if the public might only see the increase in attacks and not the rate of exchange. He\u2019d put a word in to his media relations corps and draft a memo to the local ministry of information to make sure the proper narrative was put forward.", "\u201cThey may be hurt even worse than we thought,\u201d the Cavalier suggested.", "Kemk ran his tongue over his teeth as he read the report again, thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly possible. Whoever is left in charge must be struggling to maintain order.\u201d Perhaps there was even conflict over leadership. \u201cI suspect we\u2019ll see more of this kind of action until they can re-assert control.\u201d There were reports that the unclean whore-queen of the Red Hand had been sighted on the Grasp. If she was in the region, she\u2019d never allow her people to go off the rails as badly as they had. \u201cSchedule a staff meeting for tomorrow morning,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the Red Hand is off-balance, we need to press our advantage while we can.\u201d", "Vn\u2019zamos made a note on her \u2018scroll. \u201cOf course, patron. I also spoke with Commissioner Loib. He wants to speak with you at your earliest convenience.\u201d", "The Tribune kept himself from wincing. The commissioner was here as an observer from the Bureau of Naval Resources, the civilian arm of the Space Force, responsible for (among other things), awarding and allocating construction contracts. He\u2019d been sent to Galhemna to evaluate the system and sector\u2019s stability. While he was impressed by what Kemk had accomplished to date and authorized several large federal construction contracts, the level of terrorism the Veiled Reaches endured made him cautious to do more. \u201cDid he say what this was about?\u201d", "\u201cHe did not, but I managed to speak with his assistant T\u2019nakis,\u201d Vn\u2019zamos\u2019s quills rippled. \u201cHe was\u2026 forthcoming.\u201d Her cheeks darkened in a blush. Loib\u2019s Cavalier assistant was young and hadn\u2019t ever left the core worlds before his journey to the edges of Compact territory. Finding himself the target of the older and attractive Vn\u2019zamos\u2019s attention had been an additional experience; unexpected but not unwelcome. From the satisfied nearly inaudible purr coming from his aide, Kemk suspected she had Loib\u2019s assistant wrapped around her double-jointed fingers. \u201cThe commissioner has made a decision. While he has some concerns about sector security, he has very few about Galhemna and yourself, Bastion Leader. The amount of resources we\u2019ve put into industrial development here outstrips the other systems up for the contract and Loib feels it\u2019s a clear indication of our commitment and capability.\u201d She paused, mostly for dramatic effect Kemk thought. \u201cHe is prepared to send a recommendation to Force Command that we be authorized for Level Seven construction facilities and, pending their acceptance, immediately begin construction of the centerpieces of Operation Sundial.\u201d", "Kemk felt his legs go numb and he had to sit down, overwhelmed by the news Vn\u2019zamos had just delivered. Level Seven construction sites were the largest and most advanced facilities the Compact built. The finest shipwrights, construction crews and service personnel worked at Sevens. It was these that built the greatest of the Compact\u2019s vessels. \u201cChariots,\u201d he said, scarcely believing the honour he and Galhemna were about to receive. \u201cWe can build Chariots.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cWe will build Chariots,\u201d he told Vn\u2019zamos. \u201cWe will feed and fuel Sundial, launch it and\u2026\u201d he paused again, remembering his words to Bastion Leader Yunl\u2019ro. \u201c\u2026and we will make history.\u201d", "Galhemna would forge Sundial\u2019s sword and the Principality would be humbled before it.", "~", "It was confirmed. There was a hole about half a meter in diameter through Brightest Night, starting from starboard amidships and ending port side near the prow. The round had gone right through command, punching between two slabs of reinforced armour. Less-dense railgun rounds turned into a plasma spray when they struck armour, spraying a vapour cloud of superheated particles into their target. Heavier rounds stayed largely intact and penetrated deck after deck until they broke up or exited the other side of the ship. A true warship with a properly armoured central core might have resisted the latter. Instead, the projectile had gone from one side of Brightest Night and out the other, bringing with it a sheath of plasma that had incinerated everything in each compartment the round breached. The corvette\u2019s senior staff had been vapourized; what was left of them had been sucked out into space.", "There was secondary damage all over the corvette; they\u2019d lost several scope stations and weapons mounts. Damage control teams were already sealing off depressurized sections, re-routing control functions away from the affected area. Engineering was bringing the main reactor back to full power. Brightest Night was still spinning out of control. Helm had said they could bring them out of it, but Grace had refused to let them.", "\u201cStatus of the hostile?\u201d Grace asked. Someone had given her a handkerchief. She didn\u2019t remember who, but she dabbed at the blood on her lips. Her tongue throbbed painfully and chest hurt. She could practically feel the bruises forming.", "\u201cHe\u2019s sitting out there,\u201d Allyria said. \u201cHolding fire for the moment.\u201d She directed the occasional glance towards Grace, but she kept her attention on her tactical board.

Skincutter and Burning Sigil are still engaged.\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019ll probably break off soon.\u201d Grace guessed. That Attatan Khin changed things. There was no point throwing good money after bad.", "\u201cThey\u2019re not firing?\u201d Operations asked. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they firing?\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019ve lost power,\u201d Grace said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a spin. They think we\u2019re crippled.\u201d", "\u201cWe are crippled.\u201d", "\u201cNo, just hurt. Tactical, keep an eye on that frigate. Let me know if it moves in closer, or breaks to assist one of the KNE destroyers. Engineering,\u201d Grace looked at her tech officer. \u201cKeep the main reactor down for now, but be ready to flip the switch. Let them think we\u2019re still out of it. Helm, monitor our position and get ready to break us out of this spiral.\u201d", "There was a chorus of acknowledgements. Grace took a breath. Work the problem, she thought. Some part of her wanted to start gibbering in panic, curl up in a ball and hope everything went away, but she couldn\u2019t let herself do that. In another life, she\u2019d thrown herself on the gun of an enraged Janissary. He\u2019d wanted to open fire on a clicking tide of Red\u2019s Scarab machines as they took an engineer apart. She\u2019d seen what he hadn\u2019t. The engineer had attacked them and they responded in kind. Another hostile action would see them swarm over the Janissary, her and everyone else present.", "She\u2019d ordered him to stand down. Her, a Broken not even out of the academy, giving a Tribune orders. If she\u2019d thought about it, she would have hesitated and many more people would have died. Who was she to give orders, a twenty-one year old girl from a backwater planet peopled by the most useless of client races?", "I am human, Grace thought. She took a breath, held it. I am the one in charge. I am Grace Alice Proctor and I am not Broken. She watched the icons on the main display. The Attatan Khin, just out of her reach, but still able to kill her. The convoy, moving on its new course, unsure whether they should continue out-system or return home. A dozen fat ships, each of them loaded with the supplies she\u2019d come here to take. They couldn\u2019t run. Not with that warship out there. It would catch and kill them before they ever reached the system\u2019s shock limit.", "\u201cReady a salvo of missiles,\u201d she said. \u201cDisarm their directional warheads. I want big, dirty blasts. Let me know when those are ready. Target will be the Khin.

Towards it.\u201d", "Grace settled in her chair, waiting.

Grace suspected that they were losing interest. A dead ship could be dealt with later. There were still three other Unbound for them to kill. Her stations reported in. Engineering was ready. Helm was ready. Operations, Tactical \u2013 everyone was ready. They were just waiting for her. She waited.", "Minutes passed. The frigate started to change course, curling towards the fleeing Disturbed Hive and the more distant Burning Sigil. It would overrun the former, shooting it down without even slowing on its way to the latter. Now, Grace thought. \u201cNow.\u201d", "\u201cBringing reactor to full power-\u201d", "\u201cArresting spin-\u201d", "\u201cMissiles ready for your order-\u201d", "The frigate saw them, of course.

Get us to those freighters!\u201d", "The Compact warheads slashed in, the corvette\u2019s own salvo racing back at them. The two sets of blips drew closer and closer and then the Red Hand missiles vanished from the display as they detonated in massive clouds of radiation and light, blinding the incoming weapons\u2019 tracking systems. Two missiles made it through the conflagration, still chasing Brightest Night. The point defences would be able to handle them.", "\u201cSecond launch, fire!\u201d Grace ordered, but this time her missiles detonated in close proximity to her own ship, the intense electromagnetic bursts robbing the frigate of a target. The tone of its target lock faded. They would be re-positioning their scope platforms, waiting for the thermal scars and EM interference from her missiles to dissipate before re-acquiring the corvette.", "\u201cThird launch,\u201d she said.

She just needed to buy time.", "\u201cHostile launch,\u201d Allyria reported. The frigate had reacquired Brightest Night faster than Grace thought it could. It celebrated by sending another volley of missiles slashing in at the corvette.", "\u201cHelm, give me everything,\u201d Grace said. \u201cTactical, do everything you can to jam their targeting.\u201d", "\u201cGiving it, matron.\u201d", "\u201cECM active.\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019ll catch us,\u201d Operations noted.", "Grace nodded. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. She touched her fingers to her lips. Watching and waiting. The convoy, running. Brightest Night, chasing them. The frigate, chasing her. The missiles were getting closer. Good ECCM. The corvette\u2019s defences might be able to knock down two or three, but the others would hit and hit hard. Grace watched. There; a wobble in one of the missile\u2019s courses. Another. A third. Perhaps a fourth and fifth, but she would never know. The missiles vanished.

It sees its creator. She comes and goes. Sometimes, accompanying her are different vessels. Hull types and emission spectra it does not always recognize and it stirs, only quieting at the caress of command codes. Sometimes its creator is alone. Sometimes the creator comes and touches it, whispering to it as she takes it apart and puts it back together, only different.

As it listens, it also watches. It sees Allies pass by. Each one is unique in its own way. Some have hulls that it once saw being brought in. Some look like shades of its creator. Some, like it, do not look like either. The provenance of its Allies does not concern it. They ignore it. It does not speak to them. It will only speak once.", "It catalogs everything it sees and everything it has listened to. It does not grow bored. It cannot.

It listens as the Ally ships arrive and broadcast an alert code. It accepts the code, but it still does not speak. The Ally ships leave.

Eighteen million cubic light-years. Hundreds of star systems, possibly more. Thick clouds of molecular dust, Bok globules and pillars of creation light-years in length blocked and foiled astrographic surveys and long-range telemetry. Gravitational eddies and interlacing fields of intense radiation and electromagnetic fluctuations created massive regions where shockspace was hazardous, if not outright impossible. Narrow corridors where safe FTL travel was possible formed and died with the shifting of planets and birthing stars.", "The emissions of newborn stars and forming planets concealed and distorted any artificial transmissions and energy signatures and the advance of Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro was cautious. Scouts pressed further into the nebula, relaying astrographic data back to waiting warship squadrons. Flotillas of cruisers and escorts remained ready to quickly respond to any call for aid as battle ships and battlecruisers formed knots of heavy support.

The Enemy have never heard the like before, but they have been briefed to expect ambushes and traps and their starships\u2019 sensors probe and pulse through the ether.

Finally, they see it.", "It does not, cannot truly think so it does not wonder what they might make of it. A form they have never seen before. A crown of thorns for a prow, a body of barbs, towering spines tipped with comm arrays and sensor nodes. It was made to wait, to watch, to listen and, occasionally, speak. It does so for the second time in its existence, sending laser-thin signals out like the silk cords of a spider\u2019s web.", "The mines it laid months and years ago hear its voice and ignite. Drawn in by its seduction, the Enemy never noticed that some of the stellar effluvia around them were not rocks at all.", "One of the Enemy dies amongst them, thrashing and burning. Another just barely survives. The others slow their approach, wondering whether the rocks and planetary debris around them are harmless fragments of stone, silica and ice or something else. They fire on it, but their missiles never reach their target.", "It turns away, cloaking itself and vanishing from Enemy sensors.

Enjoy!", "The Last Angel: Predator, Prey - 01", "The predator awoke to the taste of blood. It dripped down its throat, oily, salty, metallic and a mixture of a half-dozen other flavours. It opened its eyes, but there was only darkness and the stinging sensation of more wetness dripping down into its vision. There was weight pressing down on it, reeking and warm. In a flash of realization, the predator realized what that was, where it was. The dead. It had been buried in the dead it had been buried while it was still alive it was covered in the dead it wanted out it wanted out get out get out now\u2026 ", "It started to panic, clawing and thrashing. It couldn\u2019t breathe and desperation lent it strength. The bodies piled atop it began to shift. A little at first, but more and more as the predator got more leverage. It got its arms free and began shoving and pushing, its legs kicking against the oozing, rotting substrate it was covered in. Finally, one of its clawing arms burst out of the press of bodies and into a cold openness. The predator dragged itself towards freedom. It pulled itself halfway out of the dead, sucking in lungfuls of frigid air. It vomited then, emptying its stomach of acid, bile and blood. Panting in the cold, it rolled down the side of the corpse pile, gathering its wits.", "It was alive. It had been left for dead, thrown away like refuse and sealed in this freezing chamber. The panic subsided and a new feeling rose as it surveyed its surroundings, looking at the corpses thrown carelessly about the room. The pile it had pulled itself from was the largest, but there were others. Dozens, perhaps more.", "A single thought pounded through the predator\u2019s mind as it dragged itself across the floor, smearing trails of blood behind it. The cold leeched away the predator\u2019s strength, but the thought kept it moving. It reached the nearest wall, leaving a bloody, smeared handprint on the frost-coated metal as it pulled itself upright. The doors were locked, but that wouldn\u2019t stop it. It knew this room. There was more than one way out and the predator began to climb, the thought growing louder in its mind. It was a simple one.

He was looking through the offices outside one of the laboratory complexes on Vilga Orbital, a small space station officially owned by M\u00ean-an-Tol Biochemical Fabrications.

In point of fact, until recently Vilga Orbital had been under the control of something a great deal more malevolent than a simple medical research company, which was why he was here.", "Most of the computers were locked down, a security protocol that he hadn\u2019t yet been able to circumvent. There was no one to get the code from, as the blood trails indicating where the previous occupants had been dragged away attested. Many other sections had been locked down as well and it was all he could to convince the computer not to begin a full data purge.", "His breath clicked through the respirator that covered his face. The air scrubbers were working overtime, but Vilga Orbital was still contaminated. The toxin should be almost inert, but Clark didn\u2019t want to take any chances.", "\u201cProblems?\u201d His partner, Investigator Ferma Sald Thrisk Reuz Genot inquired. She was sitting on the desk next to him, looking through a sheaf of flimsies and unsecured datapads. The Tribune was nearly a foot and a half taller than DuPont and weighed more than four times as much, but she moved with confidence and surety, if not grace. Like him, she was wearing a hazard mask to filter out the last traces of the contaminant, but her short muzzle and almost-canine features required a different style of mask than Clark\u2019s own.", "\u201cJust more of the same,\u201d Clark observed. In his eyes, it had been a mistake to run this mission outside of normal channels. Actually, it had been a mistake to run it at all, but as a junior member of the largest and most efficient intelligence apparatus in the known galaxy, his opinion had neither been solicited nor welcome. \u201cThey\u2019re sloppy.\u201d From what they\u2019d been able to glean, \u2018M\u00ean-an-Tol Biochemical Fabrications\u2019 had been doing some kind of genetic research here. What kind of research was currently unknown. For that, they\u2019d either need to get into the sealed sections or have someone to interrogate. The latter was no longer possible, thanks to the actions of their allies and, of course, the plan for this mission. Ferma was well-acquainted with his opinion of the latter, so he kept further comments on the matter to himself.", "\u201cThey\u2019re mercenaries,\u201d Ferma replied. \u201cSo that goes without saying.\u201d", "Clark grunted an agreement.

Back on Rally, Clark had been another example of the uncivilized mindset of humans: a troublemaker, always getting into trouble and facing a either dead-end career in whatever service wanted to hire someone with social assimilation scores as low as his, or volunteer to serve in the Compact\u2019s military forces, which was usually the last-ditch effort to encourage cooperation, appropriate moral development and positive social attitudes. Humans were still a very young species and despite all the Compact had done for Rally over the past fifteen centuries, people like Clark still popped up. Evolution was a process that couldn\u2019t be rushed.", "Still, he hadn\u2019t been bad enough that chemical behavioural modification had been thought necessary, but it hadn\u2019t been off the table either. That was why, despite his skepticism, he had listened when the man in the nice suit had come to visit and told Clark of the potential that he saw in him.", "\u201cYou question everything,\u201d Aswarin Ganulas had told a younger Clark. The Prolocutor intelligence officer and the youth had been standing on Rally Orbital, the first and largest space station to be constructed over humanity\u2019s last colony, looking down on the planet below them. It was a sight Clark had never seen before. Until that day, he\u2019d not even been off-world. \u201cThat\u2019s gotten you into trouble. Authority, history, the decisions of the Compact.\u201d The Prolocutor had then turned to the younger human, his dark blue eyes glittering. \u201cBut there\u2019s more to you, isn\u2019t there? Others might have missed it, but we haven\u2019t. We see a lot in you, Clark. More than even you might think.\u201d That had been the beginning of a change for the young man. He had seen a different world and been given a taste of the possibilities open to him. The Triarchs themselves were said to have seen great promise in humans. One day, humans wouldn\u2019t be as primitive as they were. Until then, the Compact would be there to guide and assist their development.", "Ferma gave her smaller human partner a nudge. Tribunes were a stocky species and heavily muscled. She\u2019d never had a Broken partner before and at the beginning, she\u2019d occasionally bowled Clark over with friendly gestures of camaraderie. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d", "\u201cJust the same complaints,\u201d Clark rephrased his previous comment. \u201cI wish we had prisoners. The whole point of our operation was to get inside one of the Red Hand\u2019s swamp nests. Then someone up the ladder decides, no, infiltrating just isn\u2019t good enough. We need to kill them.\u201d", "\u201cAnd now we\u2019re here,\u201d Ferma observed.", "\u201cRight, with a poisoned station, a cluster of mercs and a pile of bodies that can\u2019t tell us anything at all.\u201d Clark groaned in frustration, running his hands through his hair. His scalp tingled. The toxin affected the target\u2019s respiratory systems. Skin contact wasn\u2019t particularly healthy, but only with exposure to high concentrations. The trace amounts in Vilga Orbital\u2019s recirculated air would only be a problem if he took his mask off and started breathing it in. The compound would break down entirely in a few days \u2013 another rationale to limit the people on Vilga to expendable mercenaries and a pair of investigators \u2013 but until it did, the chafing of the mask\u2019s straps and the itching, tingling sensation of his scalp was a constant reminder that this entire op was a shitshow.", "Before he could continue, the agent\u2019s comm pinged. Ferma\u2019s did as well. The Tribune answered first. \u201cThis is Investigator Ferma. Speak.\u201d", "\u201cYeah, this is Krenik,\u201d the voice of one of the mercenaries clicked through. \u201cWe\u2019ve got something\u2026 looks like a local failure in part of the air circ system around the cargo bays.\u201d", "Ferma rolled all four of her eyes. \u201cThen send someone to fix it.\u201d", "\u201cSure, we\u2019ll get on that. Just letting you know.\u201d", "The Tribune shut off her comm with a disgusted grunt. \u201cTen thrones that pisslicker was hoping one of us would take care of it.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t take sucker bets,\u201d Clark replied, still working at the computer. \u201cAnd that\u2019s another for the swear jar.\u201d", "Ferma said something in Oadan that was probably even more obscene, but Clark wasn\u2019t listening. He\u2019d finally been able to get through the final layer of security. The computer terminal began bringing up the last documents its user had been working on before the system had timed out and locked down.", "Maybe, Clark thought as he looked through genetic sequencing algorithms, charts, tables and spreadsheets that made no sense at all to him, maybe now we can find out what the Red Hand was doing here.", "~", "The predator climbed out of the air vents, though that was a something of an exaggeration. It was more of a controlled fall. It lay on the floor of a vacant store room, twitching and gasping. It had almost died. The others had. It was still weak, still recovering and it remained there for some time as its strength trickled back to it. The air was foul, tinged with something that the predator couldn\u2019t identify, but it was familiar. It had smelled the same thing just before the blackness came over it. It remembered choking, falling to the floor, struggling to breathe as it staggered back to its feet, hearing and seeing the others around it die\u2026 then it had woke up, covered in the dead like vermin, like garbage\u2026.", "It wiped the blood from its face, but the scent still clung to it, the odour winding its way into the predator\u2019s mind, still driving that one thought.", "-kill-", "The urge was stronger, but the predator couldn\u2019t act on it. Not yet. It was still too weak. It would wait and heal and then it would start hunting. It would find those that had left it buried under a mountain of the dead and it would-", "-the predator froze. It could hear noises outside the storeroom. Something was nearby. Something was getting closer.", "~", "Atavaan was grumbling to himself as he walked down the corridors. He was always getting stuck with the piss work. Run these reports, fix this coupling, clear out that varak nest and now it was \u2018run down a minor fault in the life support system\u2019. It was because he was a Mortificant, he told himself. Mortificants and Penitents were almost the lowest of the Compact\u2019s client races. The others, the primitive, uncivilized species at least had the excuse of still evolving, but his people and the Penitents had each betrayed the Compact in their own ways, proving that they had not truly been as enlightened as first thought. As a result, he was often given the jobs and assignments that even the other client races in the mercenary unit didn\u2019t get. He\u2019d been so busy with scutwork, he hadn\u2019t even had a chance to meet the CIS agents. He\u2019d heard one of them was a Broken. He\u2019d never met one before and had been curious.", "He was better than this, he knew it. He just needed the chance to prove it, but no one gave it to him and if they did, it was always a backhanded compliment, like they expected to see him fail. Circumstances were always against him.", "Atavaan paused, sniffing the air. There was an unusual odour here and his manidbles opened to more fully expose the scent pits on the roof of his mouth. It smelled biological. Like blood, but wrong somehow. He looked around and saw a small liquid stain spreading out from under the door to a storage closet. The mercenary touched one hand to the butt of his pistol. That closet gave access to the vent he was supposed to check out. He entered the unlock code, ready to draw his weapon, but the door opened without an unseen attacker lunging at him, nor a barrage of gunfire from a surprised survivor. It was just a room filled with various supplies and tools for routine cleaning and scutwork.", "The mercenary looked down on the floor. Laying there in a pool of blood and a crumpled tangle of too-thin arms and legs was a creature he didn\u2019t recognize. He peered at it. It was wearing a uniform. One of the station\u2019s crew? It didn\u2019t look like a scientist or a terrorist. It was a small thing, less than two meters tall if it stood upright. Its sickly pale skin was covered with blood and filth, the source of the odour he\u2019d detected, spattered with fluids of different hues and viscosity. It was curled into a fetal position.", "With his right hand still on the butt of his pistol, Atavaan nudged the strange thing with his boot. It didn\u2019t move.", "One of the crew, he thought. It had either died or crawled here when his team had released the toxin and they\u2019d missed it when they\u2019d cleaned up the rest of the\u2026 bodies\u2026", "He looked up. The air vent running through this room was open, the grate hanging down. More blood dripped from it, the same mixture of colours as covered the creature. Wait\u2026 Atavaan thought. Blood from multiple bodies. The vent shouldn\u2019t have been open. He\u2019d had to unlock the door. All those little oddities started to fall into place and he pulled his comm unit out of his pocket. \u201cThis is Atavaan,\u201d he began. \u201cI think I\u2019ve-\u201d", "Something grabbed his foot and pulled, hard. Atavaan went down with a cry, his comm bouncing and rolling across the floor, out of his hands. \u201cAtavaan?\u201d someone was saying, but the Mortificant couldn\u2019t answer. The dead creature wasn\u2019t dead any longer and it climbed onto him, keeping him from grabbing his sidearm. He punched it in the side of the head, but it didn\u2019t seem to register the blow. He tried again. It caught his arm and twisted. He cried out as his bones shattered and his left arm stopped responding. Cursing, he tried to dislodge it, pushing it back with his other hand, but it was too strong. His chitinous fingertips left angry red scratches as they clawed at the creature\u2019s blood-smeared features. It grabbed that arm and broke it too, leaving him defenceless.", "\u201cHelp me!\u201d he shouted, hoping he\u2019d be heard. \u201cSomething\u2019s here, you have to help me!\u201d", "\u201cAtavaan, are you there? I swear by the Triarchs, if this is you screwing around-\u201d", "The creature grabbed Atavaan\u2019s head in both hands and started to squeeze. The last thing he heard over the sounds of his skull cracking was Control demanding that he respond.", "~", "\u201cHave you come up with anything?\u201d Ferma asked.", "\u201cNot really,\u201d Clark said, rubbing his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll need some actual specialists to see what they were working on. All I can tell is that they were very interested in recombinant genetics. I\u2019ve been hoping to find something a bit more clear \u2013 maybe an abstract of their work, or a summary to their superiors, but I think that\u2019s all on a different partition of the drive.\u201d", "\u201cRecombinant bioengineering? That\u2019s not something I\u2019d expect from the Red Hand,\u201d the Tribune observed. \u201cThey\u2019ve always struck me more as physics and engineering.\u201d", "\u201cWell, now they\u2019re diversifying,\u201d Clark answered.", "\u201cI don\u2019t like that.\u201d", "\u201cNeither do I. What have you found?\u201d", "\u201cMostly personal logs. Nothing too interesting, but I\u2019ve found repeated references to an inspection that the station was apparently going through and \u2018the inspector\u2019.\u201d", "\u201cD\u2019varos and his team did mention that some local brass hat had been on the station when they released the toxin, but they never said who it was.\u201d", "\u201cThey may not have known. I can\u2019t find any references to the inspector\u2019s identity. They were supposed to be protecting the cargo, not mingling with the researchers. Besides, you know how coy the Red Hand are.\u201d", "That was true enough. CIS and the Red Hand had been fighting each other for decades and the latter\u2019s operational security and counter-espionage procedures could give some intelligence services Clark had worked with pointers. Clark tapped his chin. \u201cYou think we managed to bag the local overseer?\u201d", "\u201cIf we did, that could explain why that \u2018sensor ghost\u2019 Ubiquitous Law is chasing is still here. They may be seeking confirmation that their leader is dead.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s possible. I wonder if-\u201d Clark began, but was interrupted by the beep of a nearby intercom.", "\u201cThis is D\u2019varos,\u201d the mercenary leader\u2019s voice had the same simultaneous rough and lyrical aspect as the other handful of Cavaliers Clark had met, though none of them would have sullied themselves by doing something as unseemly as mercenary work. \u201cWe have a situation. Please come to Level 17.\u201d", "~", "Mortificant blood had an incredibly powerful odour and even through the filters on his mask, Clark was sure he could smell it. It looked like the mercenary\u2019s head had been smashed. No, not just smashed \u2013 crushed. Everything above the lower mandibles was a pulpy mess of bone, blood and brain tissue, like the man\u2019s head had been put into a vice.", "The human knelt next to the body, looking over the room. Behind him, the mercenary troop\u2019s leader and the guards that had found Atavaan were watching. Ferma was back at the offices. They\u2019d both assumed this was some kind of accident, or their associates had been playing some kind of game. Mistaken assumption, that.", "DuPont stood and turned to face the larger mercenary. He had to crane his neck to look D\u2019varos in the eyes, but he wasn\u2019t intimidated. \u201cYou missed someone,\u201d he said. \u201cFind them. Alive, if possible. If not\u2026\u201d he looked over his shoulder at the mangled remains of the Mortificant mercenary. \u201cI\u2019ll understand.\u201d", "He turned and left. Something about that scene disturbed him, though he couldn\u2019t have said what. He thought back to his discussion with Ferma. Maybe, the thought popped into his mind. Maybe that ship out there isn\u2019t trying to see if their man is still alive. Maybe they\u2019re waiting for something else.", "~", "The predator was back in the ducts, crawling away from its kill. It had known more would come. More than it could handle right now. It had been lucky. That one had been distracted and careless and the predator had surprised it.

Now, it was ready to hunt.", "~", "It had been nine years since Clark had first seen his world from space. In the weeks since that day, he\u2019d undergone a change. He\u2019d focused more on his studies, graduating high school in the summer semester. Clark had applied to, and with Ganulas vouching for him, been accepted to the Academy. He\u2019d graduated as an officer in the Rally Provisional Space Force, but he hadn\u2019t remained there for long, quickly transferred into the Compact\u2019s intelligence service and sent here to the Hydoghon Rise sector. Ferma had been assigned as his partner and the two had worked well together, pairing Clark\u2019s insight with Ferma\u2019s experience. They\u2019d worked to break up several minor smuggling rings, but DuPont had seen something his partner had missed. Pulling that thread had gotten them on the trail of the Waning Moon syndicate and they\u2019d managed to take it down. That success had led them here. The vacancy created by the fall of the Waning Moon had started a turf war across the sector as small-time Unbound clans attempted to step up and more established gangs tried to claim the Waning Moons\u2019 territory for themselves. The conflict had looked like it was going to turn ugly, but then it ended abruptly.", "Not through anything DuPont, Ferma or their colleagues had done, but for the same reason that rodents squabbling over a meal will stop once a larger predator approached. Clark would have liked to say that that was the CIS, but he would have been lying to himself. It hadn\u2019t been the Compact that had quelled the brewing gang war in the sector. It had been the Red Hand. They\u2019d seen the opening created by the Waning Moons\u2019 fall and they\u2019d moved in. Anyone that had quibbled over their presence didn\u2019t do so for long.", "Less than a century ago, there had been no Red Hand. It hadn\u2019t existed. Now, it was among the largest and widespread of Unbound factions in the galaxy, bringing together the disaffected, the opportunistic, the deluded and the insane under a banner of lies and truths so badly distorted that they might as well have been falsehoods themselves. It should have been just another worthless, hopeless band of misfits and criminals, feeding off the scraps of whatever they could steal. Instead, the Red Hand had spread like an infection, growing from a small band of bold and bloodthirsty scum to the kind of organization that could build places like Vilga Orbital, all under the auspices of the Red Queen. Rally\u2019s greatest shame and the most eloquent proof of all that humans were still only a hair\u2019s breadth from barbarity. The Red Hand\u2019s bloodthirsty ruler and her deluded crusade had proven to the galaxy that Broken were not yet ready to take their place alongside the civilized races.", "There were still some on Rally who idolized her, seeing her as an underdog, or a noble warrior fighting an oppressive state. Clark himself had once thought along similar lines, mistaking rebellion for righteousness. As he took stock of the contents of this laboratory, he could only feel a deep, abiding shame for ever having thought that way.", "They\u2019d finally gotten access to the laboratory decks and the CIS operatives had gone in first. The rest of the mercenaries were sweeping Vilga for any trace of their new friend. So far, there hadn\u2019t been much luck. DuPont wasn\u2019t worried. Whatever he thought of their actions so far, tracking down a lone soldier was something right up the mercenaries\u2019 alley.", "He and Ferma had finally gotten through the security locks, gaining access to the sealed laboratories. Without anyone working here, it had gone into energy-saving mode, powering down most equipment and turning off the lights. They\u2019d passed through an outer ring of offices. This part of Vilga Orbital had its own air supply and it sealed itself when the contaminant had been released, but the mercenaries had overridden the environmental safeties, feeding the toxin through the entirety of the station.", "\u201cWe have something we want to try,\u201d Clark remembered the military liaison from the governor\u2019s office saying. \u201cAn experimental compound.

A military strike runs the risk of the terrorists destroying their data, but a covert using your pre-positioned assets can eliminate any hostile operatives and leave the station and its data intact. This is a time-sensitive mission.\u201d", "There\u2019d been hundreds of people aboard Vilga when the Duskwalkers had released the compound. They\u2019d all died in a matter of moments. It had been quick, but bad. Clark stepped over the decomposing form of a researcher. There were still bodies here. Everywhere else on the station, the mercs had cleaned up their handiwork, dragging the corpses away and dumping them in freezing cargo bays. They\u2019d done that to be helpful. The forensics teams wouldn\u2019t think so.", "In point of fact, the station should already been crawling with them. Clark and Ferma had travelled to the station by shuttle. Ubiquitous Law, the frigate that had brought Clark and Ferma to Vilga, had detected what might be another ship in the vicinity.

She was pointing at a purple stripe on the wall. Like some hospitals and research centers, the Red Hand used coloured lines to delineate specific sections.

It had only taken losing two of his people to make that call.", "~", "When the Red Hand had moved into the sector, Clark and Ferma had come up with a plan, a variation on how they\u2019d managed to get inside the Waning Moons. The Red Hand were always looking for fresh blood. When they first moved into a region, the terrorists liked to co-opt existing criminal networks and political agitators, bringing locals into the fold to provide advice, guidance and other means of support. For every sector where the insurgents operated openly, there were a dozen \u201cfarm\u201d sectors like Hydoghon Rise where they simply raised money from their extralegal acts and insinuated themselves into every agency that they could.", "Hydoghon was lucky; they\u2019d caught this infestation in its early stages. The Red Hand was more interested in farming the sector than causing mayhem and they were recruiting. It was a perfect opportunity. Clark and Ferma had managed to turn a few of the Waning Moons. Now that the bulk of their clan was either scattered, in prison or awaiting execution, these individuals would reasonably have both a grudge against the Compact and be looking for work, two important characteristics for the Red Hand.", "The plan had been simple, something that could be summed into three bullet points. One: position the assets that they\u2019d turned to be recruited by the Red Hand. Two: acquire intelligence on Red Hand actions and plans in Hydoghon Rise and beyond. Three: once enough information was acquired, sweep in and break as much of the organization as possible all at once, without giving them a chance to clean house or recover. It was a good plan, but it wasn\u2019t flashy and immediate. It required patience and a delicate touch. They\u2019d been given the go-ahead, but there had been some grumbling from Hydoghon\u2019s authorities. They didn\u2019t want a slow burn. They wanted something quick and flashy, but CIS had managed to sell this op.", "Then, a shocking rumour had come across Clark\u2019s desk: this sector wasn\u2019t just another \u2018farm\u2019 to be used for income, recruitment and rabble-rousing. The Red Hand had plans beyond their usual illicit and subversive activities. When his superiors had heard that, they\u2019d become even more supportive of any effort to get assets in play inside the terrorist organization. When their superiors heard that, all those months of work had gone out the window. Clark wasn\u2019t sure if it was the usual politicking, or what had happened in the Magnameric Canyon had rattled Hydoghon\u2019s government that badly, but they started pushing harder and harder to get more information on what the Unbound were up to. Those demands quickly got one of Clark and Ferma\u2019s assets scratched when she started asking too many questions. Another went silent. It was an even bet whether he was dead, or he\u2019d decided to cut and run rather than risk being discovered.", "Still, they had gotten a bit of actionable intel. The Red Hand was establishing some kind of research facility in the sector. If a rumour had perturbed the local government and military, the possibility that the Red Hand was setting up one of their damned \u2018swamp nests\u2019 sent them into a full-blown panic. Clark and Ferma had been called into a room full of more brass than a metalworker\u2019s shop to be grilled for information that they didn\u2019t have. That was when the plan had changed and Clark had given them the rope to make the noose he currently had his head in. He and Ferma weren\u2019t proactive enough, they were told. Their ideas lacked initiative. Quick action needed to be taken.", "One of his two remaining informants had told him that the Red Hand was looking for trustworthy security for some high-value cargo they was moving. That could have been anything, but it smelled like it was related to this facility.", "That was where the Duskwalker Private Security Agency had come into play. They\u2019d done some quiet work for the sector\u2019s powers-that-be and were considered to be reliable, so they\u2019d been chosen for this operation. Clark had burned both his assets to get the mercenaries in. They\u2019d vouched for the Duskwalkers. Whatever else happened, those informants were dead. He\u2019d wanted to warn them, but if even a hint of what CIS was planning got to the Red Hand, everything would be for naught.", "So the new proactive plan went into motion. The Duskwalkers were brought to the Red Hand\u2019s research base. Clark had still urged a slower approach, using the mercenaries to track the shipments the Red Hand was sending out. Knowing what was being sent and to where would be incredibly valuable, but the upper echelons were resolved to follow through on their plan to burn the Red Hand\u2019s fingers and when it was reported that the first shipment would be sent in a matter of days, the operation was accelerated yet again.", "Hydoghon Rise Sector Command wanted to move on the intel they had now, before the Duskwalkers were found out. A military strike was out of the question. With any warning at all, the terrorists would destroy their data and fight to the bitter end, so the Duskwalkers were supplied with an experimental weapon. They\u2019d released a toxin with a name longer than Clark\u2019s hand into Vilga Orbital\u2019s life support system, killing every terrorist, pirate and fringer on the station.", "The operation was a success.", "Except for one small detail.", "~", "The predator had led its hunters into an ambush. There were two of them, each shouting excitedly and rushing after it, brandishing weapons. They thought they were chasing it, but it was leading them, moving just fast enough that they would lose sight of it, but not so quickly that they couldn\u2019t find it again. They thought it was frightened, fleeing in panic, blindly running, cornered. They didn\u2019t realize how far it had lured them from the other hunters until it was too late.", "That was when it turned on them. ", "~", "Makus and Kamus were brothers. Had been brothers. Almost twins, though Makus had been three years older. They had dressed the same, worn their hair the same way, even gotten similar tattoos. Now, the only resemblance that the ruined piles of meat that had once been a pair of Penitent siblings had was genetic. Limbs had been ripped off, ribcages shattered, heads mangled. Back on Rally, Clark had once seen a nature documentary where a greyspray gorilla had caught a magnatiger cub. The scene in this corridor reminded him of that. Whatever had done this was very strong and very fast.", "\u201cI don\u2019t suppose there was any security footage,\u201d Ferma stated.", "D\u2019Varos tilted his head in a negative gesture. \u201cNot in this section.\u201d Vilga Orbital was old. It had been abandoned for decades, stripped of everything useful. The Red Hand had been slowly retrofitting the citadel, but their focus had been on the laboratories and their work here. There were large gaps in internal sensor coverage and even larger ones in the camera network.", "\u201cOf course not,\u201d the Tribune said, examining the arterial sprays drying on the bulkheads. She knew a little about blood spatter analysis. The violence that had ended the brothers\u2019 lives had been very quick and very intense. A matter of seconds, if that. There were no defensive wounds.", "\u201cThis is wrong,\u201d Clark said as he looked over the scene.", "\u201cYou think so, do you?\u201d D\u2019varos snapped. \u201cIs that an expert investigator\u2019s opinion?\u201d", "\u201cAs a matter of fact \u2013 yes,\u201d Clark replied. \u201cAtavaan was a target of opportunity. Than-kulma might have been too, but this was an ambush. Whoever did this tore your men apart with their bare hands. Why?\u201d", "\u201cArmouries are locked down,\u201d the mercenary leader pointed out. \u201cOur guns are fingerprint-coded for safety. Only officers have access to the sealed sections.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s missing the point,\u201d the human said. \u201cWhy not use a pipe, or a knife or rig something up. An electric cage, an IED. There are a lot of easier ways to kill someone.\u201d Only, he admitted to himself. Only if a pipe or a knife would be easier.", "D\u2019varos rubbed his wrists together in a Cavalier\u2019s shrug. \u201cYou\u2019re the investigator,\u201d he told Clark. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d", "Clark raised his head, looking to his partner. Ferma open her mouth slightly, running her tongue over her teeth in an expression of unease, but she made a curt head-bob. \u201cHow much did you know about the research the Red Hand was doing here?\u201d the Broken asked D\u2019varos.", "\u201cAlmost nothing,\u201d the Cavalier replied. \u201cThey kept us in shadow. All we were told was to stay to the upper decks, mind our business and guard the cargo. They didn\u2019t like questions.\u201d", "\u201cBring your seniormost staff,\u201d Ferma said. \u201cCome to the laboratories. There\u2019s something you should see.\u201d", "~", "The predator had returned to one of its hidden places. It was sitting on its haunches, thinking. There were more prey than it had expected. It knew it couldn\u2019t kill them all by ones and twos. It paused then, allowing thoughts of its most recent kills to replay in its mind. A matter of heartbeats, but it remembered every instant in perfect clarity. Surprise had been still forming on the first hunter\u2019s face when it died. Shock turning to realization and anger on the second before it too had\u2026 come apart.", "Pleasant memories, stoking the predator\u2019s bloodlust. It wanted to head back out, find more prey and tear them to pieces just as it had the others. Instinct, sharp and clear and demanding called for it, but the predator knew the prey were on alert now. It had driven them onto the defensive. They would keep to the parts of the station that they could watch and only move beyond it in numbers.", "As planned.", "The predator rose to its feet. Time for the second phase of the hunt. It passed without challenge through the sections of the station that had once been patrolled. Soon, it found what it was looking for.", "~", "\u201cTriarch\u2019s blood,\u201d one of the Duskwalkers said as she picked her way through animal containment. The rooms reeked of decomposition. Mould was growing on several rotted bodies. \u201cWhat was this? What was going on here?\u201d", "\u201cResearch,\u201d Clark answered. \u201cGenetic research, but there were several other fields under study.\u201d", "\u201cDelightful,\u201d D\u2019varos replied, holding a fine handkerchief over his face. \u201cAnd you are showing us this why?\u201d", "Ferma tossed a datascroll to the mercenary captain. He caught it and thumbed it on, flipping through the documents on its screen. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive me,\u201d the Cavalier said. \u201cI\u2019m not well-versed in biochemical studies.\u201d He handed the \u2018scroll to one of his underlings, a Didact. The young woman\u2019s whiskers twitched as she read the information, her dark eyes widening. She looked over the \u2018scroll to the CIS agents, then back to D\u2019varos.", "\u201cThis was high-level biological research,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were looking into developing combat drugs and producing gene-mods for their soldiers.\u201d", "Clark nodded in confirmation.", "Cavalier eyelids were oriented vertically and the tall mercenary officer blinked three times in sequence, looking about the room in newfound disgust. There was a rustle of discontent from the other Duskwalkers as well. The Compact\u2019s Janissaries and Blackened used combat drugs as performance enhancers and to keep them fighting through grievous injuries. Many of the compounds in these substances had been synthesized from the study of organisms across the galaxy. There were even rumours that the most elite of the Compact\u2019s soldiers were given more extreme biochemical enhancements. That Unbound scum would seek to do the same\u2026 heresy was as close a concept as D\u2019varos could articulate. It was a violation of the natural order. \u201cThey were looking for a way to better contest Compact forces,\u201d he surmised. Most Unbound cartels would be happy with black-market combat drugs, but the Red Hand was willing and able to go farther.", "Ferma gestured to the nearest cages of and the piles decomposition within them. \u201cNekthean battle-hounds,\u201d she said. \u201cFor their adrenal secretions.\u201d The Tribune pointed to the open door that led to the next room. \u201cKalkanian apes for their fast-twitch muscle initiation. Seklon for their antifreeze proteins. Berserker mods. Pain management. Extreme weather survival. There\u2019s a greenhouse one level down. We haven\u2019t found any indication of weaponized biological weapons, but I think they were looking into agricultural sabotage. They\u2019ve been busy, but the centerpiece of Vilga is these labs.\u201d", "\u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to get through all their notes yet,\u201d Clark continued. \u201cBut they had definitely moved on to live testing of their biomods. We\u2019ve identified several specimens that seem to have been enhanced. None of them survived exposure to the toxin.\u201d", "Ferma stood and tapped on one of the cages. This one was empty, its door squeaking on its hinges. \u201cWe can\u2019t account for all of them, though.\u201d", "D\u2019varos looked at his people and then over at the cages and their rotting occupants. In the last painful, panicked moments of their lives, several of the animals had attempted to break out of their enclosures. \u201cAre you are saying,\u201d he spoke the words very carefully. \u201cThat the thing hunting my people is some kind of\u2026 of genetically-modified monstrosity?\u201d", "\u201cOh,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re saying. I don\u2019t think- \u201d", "The lights went out. A moment later emergency lighting came on, casting everything in dull oranges and reds.", "\u201cWhat was that?\u201d one of the mercenaries snapped. \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d", "\u201cDid we lose power?\u201d another asked, drawing her pistol.", "D\u2019varos was speaking into his comm. \u201cPower is still up,\u201d he told his officers. \u201cSeveral systems have gone down, including main lighting\u2026\u201d his teeth ground over one another, \u201cand the security grid.\u201d", "\u201cHow did that happen?\u201d Ferma demanded. Her larger diurnal lower eyes had closed and she glared at the mercenaries with her upper pair of eyes. They were specialized for low-light conditions and the Tribune was hardly put off by the change in illumination. Clark and several others weren\u2019t as fortunate.", "\u201cWe\u2019re tracing the fault back now,\u201d D\u2019varos snapped. Several moments passed as he listened to reports coming from the command deck. \u201cIt appears the cause of the failure was an override initiated from a security sub-station several decks below this one,\u201d he reported.", "\u201cAn override,\u201d Clark deadpanned. He shared a look with his partner, the bigger woman\u2019s lips drawing back from her sharp white teeth. They both knew what that meant.", "D\u2019varos\u2019s Didact looked from her captain to the CIS agents, her tail getting bushier by the second. She was quick, reaching the same conclusion that Ferma and Clark had already come to, but before she could speak, one of her comrades blurted out a question. \u201cIs this that thing? How could it have done this? You said it was an animal!\u201d", "\u201cI never said that,\u201d Clark clarified. \u201cIn fact, I think this confirms our initial read of the situation.\u201d", "\u201cWhich is?\u201d D\u2019varos growled angrily, his eyes glinting in the orange-red lighting.", "\u201cWhat we\u2019re facing isn\u2019t an animal,\u201d Clark said as he drew his pistol and checked the clip. \u201cI think what we\u2019ve got is this project\u2019s first success. Congratulations, captain. You and your men are going to be the first to face a Red Hand super-soldier.\u201d", "~", "The station was dark, its hallways lit by intermittent running lights and emergency glow panels. The predator wasn\u2019t bothered and it stalked these corridors as easily as if it were daylight. It passed beneath a security camera, the device offline with the rest of the station\u2019s augurs. It heard shouting up ahead and it increased its pace. It took hallways and cross-corridors as it closed on the source of the sounds. More prey. Under the faint orange glare of an emergency lamp, an officer was directing a pair of repair techs as they pulled a panel off the wall, trying to restart some of the security systems on this deck. The predator\u2019s lips drew back from its teeth. It had expected them here.", "The predator drew silently closer. The technicians were arguing, the officer glancing up and down the halls as he snapped orders at them, but he hadn\u2019t looked in the predator\u2019s direction yet. It stayed as much in the shadow as it could, but the swirl of emergency lighting got more intense the nearer it drew. It wouldn\u2019t be able to hide much longer, but it didn\u2019t need to.", "Closer. Closer.", "Something alerted the prey. Perhaps the predator had been too eager, perhaps its feet had scuffed on the deck, perhaps the officer had heard its breath or been warned by some other sense, but the mercenary turned. His eyes widened as he saw the predator. The gun in his hands came up and his mouth opened to shout a warning.", "The predator charged. Gunshots echoed through the halls."]}

The information minister took a sip of his redblade tea, looking out the window of his one hundred and fiftieth story office on the northern tower of the Atraeza Triskelion. Kiel Point stretched out before him, almost to the horizon. The city had once been the landing point for most of the original colony\u2019s starships and over the course of the next thousand years \u2013 minus a small setback here and there \u2013 it had grown into the planet\u2019s largest city, and the seat of authority for humanity\u2019s own small corner of the cosmos. Fifteen million people called Kiel Point home. To the north, the city sprawled out towards the snow-capped Reclaimer Mountains. To the west, there were the Landing Plains. History could never agree if they\u2019d been given that name when they\u2019d been selected as the colony\u2019s drop site, or in honour of Carl Land, the helmsman who\u2019d died to bring Vangva down to Kiel Point safely. Several of the ancient ships were still there, turned into a mixture of monuments, museums and mausoleums.", "To the east and south, there was the clear blue sea of Rally\u2019s Palantic Ocean, the press of the tides broken up by the Palisade Islands, a network of rocky landmasses, shoals and reefs that made blue-water travel in and out of Kiel Point dangerous even on good days, but functioned as a natural bulwark against the Palantic\u2019s storms and tidal surges. The Atraeza and most of the government sector was in fact built on Burke\u2019s Heart, the largest of the Palisades and separated from the rest of the city by the short, wide and deep saltwater Splitting Bow River.", "Air traffic filled the sky in neatly ordered lanes: drones, skimmers, flitters and hoppers all travelling here and there, just as groundcars and low-flying craft plied the roads below. Kiel Point was home to four different spaceports; two of which were small civilian centers, solely for intra-planetary, suborbital and close-orbit travel. Neither handled craft more than a few dozen meters long and both of them were within the official city limits. It was the larger Amigara Down and the Lexine Harada Military ports that could handle craft hundreds of meters in size and those needed room for both the massive vessels and the sprawl of reinforced landing bays and service hangars that serviced them. The former was west of Kiel Point itself on the Landing Plains, while the latter was to the east, using several of the shoreward Palisades as well some artificial islands constructed when space had become an issue.", "Lunenburg\u2019s office did not look out towards either of the large spaceports, for which he was grateful. He much preferred the relative serenity of the city and the mountains beyond to the emptiness of the plains or the ocean, with nothing to catch the eye but the constant movement of behemoth starships wallowing in Rally\u2019s gravity as they ascended to, or descended from the heavens. In the distance, thunderheads were forming above the Reclaimers, the dark clouds growing thicker and more malignant. It was even odds whether they\u2019d drift further to the north, or come south to drizzle rain and hail upon the city.", "The minister took another sip of his tea. Redblade was not a plant native to Rally. It wasn\u2019t even from Earth, though the colonists had carried with them specimens and genetic samples of almost every organism from that doomed planet. Sadly, few had survived the asteroid strikes that had turned a small but flourishing colony into fractured bands of survivors on the cusp of extinction. The Compact of Species had discovered Rally after the Impacts, when the starving population was at its greatest need and saved them and for fifteen hundred years hence, humanity had dutifully and faithfully served their saviours.", "Jacob took another small sip, savouring the taste. Redblade was a hybrid, incorporating traits from Rally and Terran plants. It had been hoped to counter the spread of the toxic native yellowblade grass. Its success on that front was not as complete as its creators had hoped, but it did make for a very nice tea. It was something of an acquired taste, though. Jacob was forever trying to get his staff to partake. So far he\u2019d made very few converts. More for me, then, he thought with a brief smile.", "\u201cSir,\u201d the comm on Lunenburg\u2019s desk beeped, interrupting his reverie. \u201cYour guests are here.\u201d", "The minister nodded, though his assistant couldn\u2019t see the gesture. \u201cVery good, Jayli. Send them in.\u201d", "Jacob set the cup down his desk as the doors to his office opened. \u201cGentleman,\u201d he said by way of greeting. \u201cLady,\u201d he finished. \u201cPlease, have a seat.\u201d His hand hovered over the intercom. \u201cWould you like anything? I can have another pot brewed.\u201d", "\u201cNo thank you, minister,\u201d Vincent Loctong replied as he straightened his shirt. He was a short, stocky man, with brown hair liberally sprinkled with grey. Loctong was Lunenburg\u2019s deputy minister and the official second-in-command of the Rally Provisional Government\u2019s Ministry of Information. He might have been small in stature, but he was undeniably driven. No one could ever accuse Vincent of slackness, but his fervent support for the Compact occasionally made him adversaries among those who he considered to be less devoted to their duty and responsibilities than he was.", "On Loctong\u2019s left was Lunenburg\u2019s undersecretary, Albert Patrick Ouattara, the unofficial second man in the ministry\u2019s totem pole. Unlike Lunenburg himself and the rest of his inner circle, Ouattara wasn\u2019t an appointee, but a career bureaucrat who kept the ministry running from one administration to the next. He\u2019d been in his position for fifteen years, serving the ministry and Rally\u2019s needs diligently, capably and discretely. He was a quiet man who could blend into the background without even trying, but he was efficient, well-versed in finagling, making back-room deals and helped keep the wheels of government running smoothly.", "Taking the leftmost chair and looking slightly awkward as she did so was Riya O\u2019Connell, associate deputy minister. Unlike the three men in the room, O\u2019Connell wasn\u2019t Rally-born. She was an Aster, born and raised on Krakow Iron, one of Rally\u2019s larger asteroid colonies. Krakow Iron, like several of Rally\u2019s older extraplanetary habitats, still relied primarily on the centripetal force of its artificially-adjusted spin to simulate gravity and the deputy minister\u2019s thin, long-limbed frame bespoke her heritage in a low-gravity environment. While Rally\u2019s 1.038 gs wasn\u2019t harmful to O\u2019Connell, it wasn\u2019t entirely comfortable and she spent most of her time in space, functioning as the ministry\u2019s liaison to the rest of the system and the five hundred million men and women who lived off-planet.", "The Ministry of Information did important work for the Rally Provisional Government. They handled all media matters for the government, as well as issues of heritage and culture, public safety, awareness and social development. The ministry assisted in vetting and issuing most governmental press releases, raised public consciousness of important issues and worked with other governmental and civilian agencies to ensure the proper narratives and context were applied to any mass media, from new government initiatives to widespread advertising campaigns. Lunenburg preferred to think of his administration\u2019s ministry as filling an advisory and assistant role to the more proactive agencies, helping them dot their i\u2019s, cross their t\u2019s and stay on-message. In times past, \u2018Minifor\u2019 had been seen as overbearing, with too firm a hand on the wheel. Worse, there\u2019d been occasional infighting amongst its administrators and bureaucrats over what their narratives should actually be communicating and how that should be done, leading to internal paralysis and external confusion about contradictory directives from the agencies they were supposed to be working with. Lunenburg wanted to keep and polish Minifor\u2019s image as a friendly helper, not a scowling diktat.", "Today was their quarterly review. Most of the major issues would be handled in more open, in-depth meetings over the next week, but Lunenburg liked to have these informal get-togethers. It was a good way to stay in touch with everyone and make sure they were all working from the same playbook, as well as a giving everyone a chance for last-minute concerns to be raised off the record.", "\u201cThank you all for coming,\u201d the Minister said. \u201cI know some of you have had a longer journey than others,\u201d he nodded to Riya, \u201cso we\u2019ll try to keep this brief. I know the main focus of our quarterly review will be the rolling out of the SCP initiative, but why don\u2019t we begin with some housekeeping, first? Vincent, I know you\u2019ve been looking over a few things recently, so why don\u2019t you start us off?\u201d", "\u201cThank you, minister. I don\u2019t have much to say that hasn\u2019t been in my reports, really. Everything\u2019s been doing well of late. First some local news. Since the Ministry of Justice seems to be satisfied, the checkpoints in Kiel Point will be taken down. That announcement will be coming later today.\u201d", "There were a series of appreciative nods from the others. Rally\u2019s Provisional Government worked hard to prove themselves to the Compact, but there were still small segments of the population that would always be dissatisfied, whether it made sense or not. This dissatisfaction occasionally boiled over into protests, some more\u2026 exuberant than others. As a response, local police forces and, occasionally, Enforcers from the Commission for the Stabilization of Territories had to be deployed to handle these events and take a firm hand in the aftermath to prevent any additional flare-ups. Loyal citizens could expect a brief delay in travel as police forces conducted screenings to try and identify some of the instigators and criminals responsible for worst of demonstrators\u2019 actions.", "The latest protests were about the Bequeathed incident. The loss of a training ship, its crew and two hundred of Rally\u2019s best and brightest was a tragedy, but there were certain malcontents who were exploiting it and using it advance their own political agenda.", "\u201cHowever,\u201d Loctong continued. \u201cI would like to once again point out a worrying trend I\u2019ve noticed in the last six months.\u201d He tapped out some commands on his datapad, sending images to the holoprojector built into Lunenburg\u2019s desk. The Ministry of Information was heavily involved in campaigns of social conscience and public awareness. To that end, they frequently distributed information updates to public terminals as well as putting up posters and notifications regarding public works and in support of social mores, advocating the precepts and ideals important to Rally and the Compact. Many of the deputy minister\u2019s images were of these, though they had all been vandalized. On one poster, someone had sprayed \u2018LIES!\u2019 Next was a smart board that would cycle through a series of images and advertisements, but the screen and the pictures it would show had been all but obliterated beneath a barrage of red hand prints. Another poster, one made to commemorate the casualties of Bequeathed had been desecrated with the words \u2018WHO FAILED WHOM?!\u2019 spattered hastily across it. Vincent\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cI hope you all agree that this is a point for concern.\u201d His brown eyes glared at the graffiti as if he could make both it and the artists responsible burst into flame.", "\u201cWell, it\u2019s certainly troubling-\u201d Riya began.", "\u201cTroubling!\u201d Vincent interrupted. \u201cDo you not see that?\u201d He pointed emphatically at the handprints on many of the posters, a signature of sorts for the vandals. The smarter one always wore gloves when they did that. \u201cDo you know what that signifies?!\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m perfectly aware,\u201d O\u2019Connell replied, her voice getting several degrees colder. \u201cBut we\u2019ve had idiots for over a thousand years. This particular brand are just trying to be extra shocking with their counter-culture ideology.\u201d", "\u201cThat \u2018counter-culture ideology\u2019 as you put it,\u201d Loctong replied, glaring at the woman. \u201cHas been around for more than half a century and despite our best efforts, is growing.\u201d", "Riya rolled her eyes. \u201cTwo decades ago, it was close to being wiped out. Before that, it was allegedly an existential threat in waiting and before that, it was still a bunch of malcontented idiots latching onto something to express their nonsense. Hydrogen and human stupidity, Vincent.\u201d", "Loctong\u2019s nostrils flared and he hit another button on his \u2018pad. This time, a short clip of the latest protest outside the Atraeza came up. The video was muted, but the crowd was shouting and jeering. There were a few hundred protestors, dozens of them with placards.", "TELL US THE TRUTH!", "NO MORE LIES!", "WHO FAILED WHOM?", "On the steps of the government building were a young man and woman, the latter with a megaphone. She paced back and forth, gesticulating to punctuate her speech, riling the crowd up. Another clip followed of Kiel Point Police moving in to disperse the protest. The two organizers had been taken into custody and were being led away. Before she was put into the back of a squad car, the woman looked to the crowd and raised her shackled hands, crossing her wrists. Her counterpart did the same. Both their hands had been painted red. The crowd cheered and the clip ended.", "\u201cI\u2019m not seeing the problem,\u201d Riya said, shrugging languidly. \u201cIt was loud, but non-violent. The organizers were detained for questioning and the crowd dispersed when they were told to. I don\u2019t care what symbols they chose to use.\u201d", "Loctong\u2019s cheeks reddened. \u201cYou don\u2019t see any issue with the leaders of this\u2026 this disobedience using the imagery of red hands?\u201d", "\u201cNot at all. It identifies them quite nicely for law enforcement.\u201d", "Vincent opened his mouth, closed it and looked to Jacob and Albert for support. Ouattara simply stared back. He\u2019d spent long enough in his position to know that choosing sides in office politics was a bad idea. He kept his head down and focused on the work and let others get into turf wars.", "Lunenburg didn\u2019t say anything either, but he lifted a single finger in warning. Vincent\u2019s zealousness was frequently an asset. It gave him a dedication to his work that was hard to find, and allowed him to filter otherwise innocuous-seeming material for inappropriate, off-narrative or in several cases, outright seditious messages\u2026 but as often as it was an benefit, it could also be a detriment. His staff had a high turnover as the deputy minister had a rigorous work ethic and little patience for people not as committed as he was, and often considered slackness or inattention to detail a moral failing, particularly in people who missed what he felt should be obvious.", "Contrasting her very driven superior, O\u2019Connell had a more lax outlook when it came to ideological purity, but the Aster took her job as seriously as anyone else. Still, she and Vincent often butted heads. Jacob suspected that was one reason why Riya spent as much time in off-planet as she did. \u201cWe can leave this part of the debate for Justice,\u201d the minister said, weighing in. \u201cOur job is to help people understand, not to punish anyone for speaking their mind,\u201d he said, getting a grudging nod from Loctong. \u201cBut we can also all agree that an increase in antisocial vandalism is a point of concern.\u201d He met Riya\u2019s face next and got a similar gesture of acknowledgement. \u201cThis is something that requires inter-departmental coordination and we won\u2019t solve it here. Vincent, thank you for keeping us up to date. Riya,\u201d Lunenburg said as he blanced back at his deputy associate minister. \u201cYou\u2019ve said you\u2019ve noticed something similar across several of the habitats?\u201d", "O\u2019Connell tapped one very thin finger on the arm of her chair. \u201cYes,\u201d she said at last. Though all of Rally\u2019s extra-planetary colonies were only a handful of day\u2019s travel from each other and the planet itself, they had been founded when that wasn\u2019t always the case. There was a stubborn, independent spirit among the asteroids, moons and drifts of the Rally system, a certain reluctance to follow the lead of their capital and they didn\u2019t always conform to social metrics as fully as the planetary population. It would be exaggerating to say there was any significant tension between the two populations, but Asters and Rally-born had always had a difference in their outlooks. \u201cThere has been a small uptick in counter-cultural movements and expressions of discontent among the colonies, especially in the last few months.\u201d", "Vincent got a look of vindication, but one look at Jacob and a second finger raised in warning kept him from saying anything. Though he tried to maintain his aura of professional civility at all times, it was known that once Lunenburg reached five, his patience was at an end. \u201cI\u2019ve heard there\u2019s been a little more than that,\u201d Jacob coaxed.", "Riya winced inwardly. She hadn\u2019t been looking forward to this part, but Vincent had gotten her back up. She didn\u2019t want to give him an inch, but she had no choice. \u201cYes. A raid of one of the syndicates in the Halfway asteroid belt turned up some illicit documents and propaganda.\u201d", "\u201cWhat kind of propaganda?\u201d Ouattara put in mildly, one eyebrow arched curiously. Riya wasn\u2019t sure if he already knew or not. He was a hard one to read.", "O\u2019Connell sighed, bringing up her own datapad and sent images from the raid to the holo plate on Lunenburg\u2019s desk, replacing Loctong\u2019s slideshow. Her associates watched attentively. The first clip was helmet cam footage from one of the police officers present, showing off some of the contraband they\u2019d confiscated. There were a handful of data drives and \u2018scrolls and the officer turned one of the latter on. It broadcast a small hologram of an attractive human female giving a speech. She had paler skin than most natives of Kiel Point, blue eyes and hair. Albert\u2019s eyes widened. Vincent\u2019s heavy cheeks reddened, but Lunenburg simply waited for Riya to continue. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working closely with local police forces to see how far this\u2026 material has been disseminated,\u201d Riya said. \u201cSo far, it doesn\u2019t seem to have gotten very far.\u201d", "\u201cOh, well that\u2019s very comforting,\u201d Loctong snapped. \u201cSome of our citizens are smuggling in Red Hand agitprop, but you don\u2019t think it\u2019s gotten very far!\u201d", "\u201cIt was a handful of smugglers bringing everything from pharmaceuticals, to de-listed entertainment to, yes, a crate or two of speeches from the Red Hand. I didn\u2019t think it was anything worth panicking over. Security forces are searching out the syndicate\u2019s customers and I\u2019ve passed instructions to local confessors to be more vigilant for signs of this nonsense. The Halfway administration is working with my staff. They\u2019ve gotten several programs on the dangers of the Red Hand added to local vid channels, along with some expos\u00e9 material to reinforce the lessons. None of the sensationalist schlock that glamorizes those lunatics, either.\u201d She leaned back in her chair, glaring at Vincent. Don\u2019t tell me how to do my job.", "Vincent pursed his lips, but he couldn\u2019t find fault with O\u2019Connell\u2019s response. \u201cThat woman is a virus,\u201d was what he said instead. \u201cShe\u2019s insidious and every time her band of degenerate misfits kill someone, it reflects badly on all humanity. I take that very seriously, and very personally. I, and the three billion law-abiding citizens in this system will not be compared to that\u2026\u201d his jaw worked as if he were trying to spit out a curse, but restrained himself, \u201cthat psychopath.\u201d", "\u201cShe\u2019s a sore spot for all of us, Vincent,\u201d Riya said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to give her any more power over us than necessary. If we overreact every time some idiot teenager splashes red paint on their palms or we get a glimpse of a few dozen bits of agitprop, we look alarmist and make her look more impressive than she is. None of us want either of those things.\u201d", "\u201cI think we can all agree on that,\u201d Lunenburg said to settle the issue. \u201cIf you think you\u2019ve got the matter in hand, then we\u2019ll trust your judgement. Besides, we\u2019re on the verge of rolling out the SCP initiative, so that should help too.\u201d", "There were three nods from his subordinates. \u201cVincent,\u201d Jacob said, trying to get his deputy minister\u2019s mind off the dour business of instigators and criminals. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give us an update on the entertainment situation?\u201d", "\u201cHmm? Oh, yes of course, minister.\u201d Vincent said, quickly bringing up his notes. \u201cNothing too exciting, the appropriate departments are handling everything. Just a few notes. Van Clef is still dragging his heels.\u201d The Ministry of Information published guidelines, suggestions and recommended codes of conduct for makers of movies, vidcasts, theater, games and other forms of entertainment, to ensure that any messages: intended, indirect or otherwise supported the accepted political narratives. Art was political, as the saying went. That meant it had certain responsibilities. Artists spoke as loudly as any other public official and that gave them the same duties to be mindful of what they said and how they said it.", "Of course, the codes of conduct were entirely voluntary. No studio or creator was obliged to follow them, but there could be penalties for material that was considered particularly egregious or inflammatory, usually deliberate incitement, hate speech, encouragement to criminal actions, or other forms of antisocial expression.", "Makalo van Clef was an award-winning filmmaker, noted for his love of noir films and his adaptations of pre-Cataclysm human media into modern stories. Of late, he\u2019d been working on the espionage psychological thriller What Isn\u2019t. His last few pictures had approached, and even brushed up against some of the ministry\u2019s guidelines and there were rumours from the set that the director was taking this work into even darker places.", "He\u2019d also refused to submit drafts to Minifor\u2019s entertainment division, as most large-budget films did and there\u2019d been some grumblings from the studio about his behaviour. Van Clef wasn\u2019t particularly eccentric, so the sudden secrecy had raised some eyebrows, as had several cryptic comments the director had made about this upcoming work. Normally, a single film choosing to block out Minifor was hardly worthy of the attention of any of the people in the room, but van Clef was a big name in the entertainment industry. If he was willing to snub the ministry to this extent, then others might follow. At the very least, it was worth looking into.", "\u201cI suppose the usual tactics have proven ineffective,\u201d Lunenburg said, tapping his fingers on his desk as he scanned Loctong\u2019s notes.", "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have let it get this far up the chain if they hadn\u2019t,\u201d Victor assured the minister. He glanced at Ouattara and O\u2019Connell. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like an alarmist, but there might be some kind of\u2026 influence on van Clef.\u201d", "\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d Riya said. \u201cNot everything-\u201d she broke off when she noticed Lunenburg raising one finger off his desk in warning to her and her jaw clicked shut.", "\u201cThat might be,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cBut he almost might just be trying to stir up a buzz about this latest project. There\u2019s a difference between being provocative and pushing the envelope and outright advocating or lionizing antisocial attitudes. We can\u2019t know which it is unless we can do our jobs and evaluate that project. Van Clef should know that. He has a responsibility to his audience here and outside the system and a duty to make sure his work doesn\u2019t put us in a bad light. Our entertainment isn\u2019t just seen by three billion humans, but it reaches people light-years away. When the rest of the Compact looks at what we\u2019re making, I want them to have no doubts about both the quality of our product and the quality of its message. That\u2019s important. Our culture and what it says about us as a people \u2013 what we value and how we value it \u2013 is important. For most other citizens of the Compact, that\u2019s all they\u2019ll know of humans. Remind van Clef of that. If he still refuses to at least give us a look at his project, tell him the ministry is prepared to delist What Isn\u2019t\u2026 prior to its theatrical release.\u201d", "\u201cThat will get his attention,\u201d Loctong agreed. Through its entertainment section, the Ministry of Information could indicate a film, game, play or other media product contained unacceptable material. Perhaps it was too violent, violated civil rights, or crossed too many ideological thresholds to be considered fit for widespread consumption. In such instances, the work in question would be \u2018delisted\u2019. This action took three different forms: the first was simply an acknowledgment that the work was not suitable for general exposure. It would receive no government funding, tax breaks or other benefits and only by applying for special permission to present it would a venue be allowed to do so, though versions with the objectionable material edited out would be acceptable for public forums.", "The second level of delisting was banning the work\u2019s distribution. It would not be illegal to procure or possess it, but it would be illegal to disseminate it. The third and final option was only for the most incendiary work, which was determined to have no redeeming value whatsoever. In such cases, even the possession of the material would be a criminal offence.  It would scarcely be necessary to go that far, but even the first method would cripple a film in its infancy and likely kill the project. The threat of it would almost certainly bring the recalcitrant director to heel and if not him, than the studio that financed and funded him. \u201cI\u2019ll have my staff draft a message this afternoon,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cSomething polite but firm. We don\u2019t want to get his back up, but as you said\u2026 just remind him of his responsibilities.\u201d", "Jacob gave a confirming nod. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d", "\u201cOn a smaller, but somewhat more amusing note,\u201d Vincent continued, tapping out some commands on his \u2018pad. \u201cThere\u2019s been another script submission by Carlyle Rios.\u201d The small man\u2019s lips twitched up in a smirk. \u201cI\u2019ve just sent it to you all for review.\u201d", "Albert rolled his eyes. Riya opened the document, scanning the pages. Her cheeks reddened and she put one hand over her mouth to suppress a chuckle. \u201cOh my,\u201d she said.", "Carlyle Rios was, as he liked to call himself, the creator of Rally\u2019s most \u2018socially-conscious erotica\u2019. He had a prolific career as a pornographer, but in the last decade and a half, he\u2019d begun to fancy himself as quite the progressive thinker. He\u2019d begun to blend his political values into his work. It was a laudable effort and just the sort of thing the Ministry of Information liked to see in artists and creators, but the results were mixed. What scripts Rios didn\u2019t write himself, he liked to edit to put his own personal touch on and he was much a better director of pornography than a writer. He was increasingly fond of over-writing his scripts, adding extraneous dialogue to scenes that didn\u2019t require it in the first place, and provided neither great political insight or arousal.", "Despite this, Rios was undeterred and in recent years, Minifor\u2019s entertainment section had found themselves suffering a barrage of well-intentioned offers from the director, ranging from frequent invites to sets and screenings as well as scripts and drafts to be reviewed for ideological conformity. Since he had a lot of projects on the go at any given time, the Ministry of Information had had to hire someone specifically to deal with the influx of material Rios generated.", "No one was quite sure whether Rios was serious about his claims, whether he was just seeking to achieve legitimacy through political bandwagoning or he was simply tweaking the nose of the authority that kept a watchful eye on his particular genre. There were rumours that he was trying to break into more serious pictures, or even politics. In either case, Rios would surely find his colleagues in either field as befuddled and amused by him as those in the Ministry of Information.", "\u201cI assume the director has been notified that while we appreciate his interest, this is not the kind of script that the Ministry is hoping to develop in regards to the Bequeathed incident?\u201d Jacob said.", "\u201cWe want something respectful,\u201d Ouattara noted. \u201cNot a skin flick.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Riya said, her eyes alight with amusement. \u201cI think there\u2019s some potential here. The dialogue isn\u2019t as bad as his usual work and we get to page 20 before anyone\u2019s clothes come off. He must have someone ghost-writing this one. Maybe we should have him do a little more work and try again?\u201d", "Albert raised his eyes to the ceiling. \u201cTriarchs preserve,\u201d he muttered.", "Jacob shook his head. \u201cSpeaking of that, how is the Bequeathed production coming along?\u201d It had been his idea to have an inspirational film done about the incident. Bequeathed had been one of the Rally Provisional Space Force\u2019s handful of cruisers, an old but solid ship that had been taking two hundred academy cadets on a tour of the local systems for some hands-on field experience. That vessel had never made it past Rally\u2019s closest astronomical neighbor Terrahope, lost with nearly all souls. Several hundred crew and two hundred eager young officer-cadets had died. There\u2019d been only one survivor and his accounting of the tale was sadly uninformative, leaving thousands of friends and families seeking closure. As so often in the wake of calamity when there was no rhyme or reason to be found, fingers had begun to point. Several of the officers\u2019 families had publicly insinuated that it was human incompetence that had led to Bequeathed\u2019s destruction, while relatives of the dead cadets had fired back by stating that if that was the case, then the officers that were supposed to be overseeing those cadets had failed quite spectacularly themselves.", "Adding more uncertainty to the whole affair were the confused reports coming out of the RPSF\u2019s headquarters. The investigation was still ongoing, but the official report was leaning towards an undetected fault in the cruiser\u2019s primary reactor. However, two weeks ago, an internal memo had been leaked wherein reference to an \u2018unclassified presence\u2019 in Terrahope was made.", "The conflicting reports and increasingly acrimonious public discord had led to several of the protests and streaks of vandalism that Vincent had discussed. To try and calm things down or \u2013 at least draw the spotlight away from the as-yet-unfinished investigation \u2013 Lunenburg\u2019s office had stated interest in producing a film or mini-series to memorialize the victims of the Bequeathed disaster. Currently, they were still talking to producers about what shape the work was to take. A few particularly fast writers, such as Rios, had already submitted spec scripts for review. \u201cNo one\u2019s jumped out at us yet,\u201d Vincent replied. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of facts up in the air, but the interviews with the friend and families of the victims are going well. We\u2019re still just collecting data at this stage. I think it\u2019ll be a few more weeks before we can start developing a narrative.\u201d", "\u201cGood, good. This is supposed to calm things down out there by getting everyone to remember the victims, not who did what. Keep on top of it, Vincent. This needs to stay on-message.\u201d", "\u201cYes sir,\u201d Loctong said, scribbling a few more notes on his \u2018pad.", "\u201cNow, the big issue,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cThe roll out of our public awareness campaign. Albert, if you would?\u201d                                                                                                                                                                        ", "Ouattara stood and adjusted the fit of his suit. \u201cThank you, minister.\u201d He nodded at Vincent and Riya next. \u201cYou\u2019ve been kept up to date on our SCP initiative and your contributions have been extremely useful, so I\u2019m pleased to be able to show off a sneak peek before our respective staffs have a look at it tomorrow. Thanks to the feedback of focus groups, the assistance of various departments and the buy-in from key individuals, we\u2019ve been able to polish the finer edges and we\u2019ll be ready to roll it out starting in two months. This is our keynote symbol,\u201d he said with a well-deserved touch of pride. The undersecretary had been working on hard on the awareness campaign and everything Lunenburg and his associates had seen indicated it was going well.", "Albert clicked a button on a remote control. On Lunenburg\u2019s desk projector, a new image came up, a simple poster-sized hologram. It had a plain white background and on it, a stylized orange human arm reached across to hold a Tribune\u2019s hand.  At the bottom, there were three words.", "Society. Culture. Progress.", "\u201cAs you can see, we\u2019re keeping the design simple like we talked about. No extraneous details \u2013 the focus is entirely on the message.\u201d Albert clicked through a few other posters, all them equally simple in design. The theme of Ministry\u2019s SCP initiative was cooperation and coordination, a way to enforce the connections that Rally had with the Compact and remind its people that they were partners. A young species\u2019s development couldn\u2019t be rushed, no matter what some people said and occasionally gentle but firm reminders of that were needed. It was just over a millennium since humans had despoiled their own world and the few survivors of the Cataclysm had nearly gone extinct themselves. On the time scales of evolution, that was less than an eyeblink.", "The Compact had existed for six thousand years. Its ruling members knew more about the galaxy than other civilizations ever would, and part of that was the knowledge that developing species like humanity still needed guidance. This paternalism could chafe and cause resentment among the less-civilized species who felt that they deserved or had earned to right to stand as equals, but the Compact had a storied history and it knew well what could happen when a species was given too much too quickly. It was better to be slow and sure, than to rush a people into something they were not yet ready for. Humanity knew that better than most; they had almost destroyed themselves and without the Compact\u2019s intervention would have faded from existence. Still, as Vincent and Riya had said, there was the occasional flare-up of discontent, even on Rally. One of the Ministry\u2019s central jobs was to smooth over humanity\u2019s growing pains. The SCP campaign was the latest work to that end.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve also undergone some last-minute tweaks of some of the infomercials,\u201d Ouattara continued. \u201cThere were some cultural issues we stumbled over with the ads and programming targeted to the Brutes, but we\u2019ve corrected those.\u201d Rally wasn\u2019t just a human world, but a multicultural one. There was a sizable population of Tribunes on-planet, a smattering of other races and more than ten million Brutes, those lucky enough to have been chosen as Envoy Children. Their world had only recently joined the Compact, but their people were recalcitrant and hostile to the Compact\u2019s guidance. The Envoy Children program was a way to civilize and introduce a generation of savages to true culture. Rally had been honoured with the lion\u2019s share of these children, the Compact feeling that the example set by humanity was a valuable one. It would be a learning experience for the younger species, to show them how to properly socially assimilate into galactic culture and to wean them away from their primitive superstitions and natural barbarity.", "Riya frowned. \u201cWhat \u2018cultural issues\u2019?\u201d Few, if any, Envoy Children had been settled on any of the outer-system colonies and habitats. Most of the Brutes there had drifted away from Rally, taking on whatever menial work was available, starting fights and generally living down to expectations. \u201cI thought the entire point of the Envoy Children program was to break them away from their own toxic society and get them to accept ours. There\u2019s been enough issues with that already.\u201d Left to their own devices, the Brutes were aggressive, short-sighted and violent. From what O\u2019Connell had seen, it was a wonder the creatures ever made it to the nuclear age without blowing themselves to bits. She hadn\u2019t yet met one Brute who hadn\u2019t proven the Compact\u2019s policies in regards to less civilized cultures correct. They weren\u2019t mentally or socially ready to be members of the galactic community. Humanity wasn\u2019t quite there yet either, but they were surely further along that track than the Brutes!", "Rally had had one example to the contrary, a young woman who\u2019d overcome her species\u2019s natural tendencies and become an officer-cadet in the Rally Provisional Space Force. She\u2019d been killed aboard Bequeathed with the rest of her peers. It was easy to make an exemplar out of a dead person, but there was only so much mileage you could get out of someone who\u2019d died before even graduating.", "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing major,\u201d Ouattara assured the associate deputy minister. \u201cPerhaps \u2018culture\u2019 was the wrong word. More like differences in species psychology. Some minor issues with perspective, framing and colouration on our displays, but we\u2019ve addressed that.\u201d", "\u201cAh,\u201d Riya said. \u201cAll right,\u201d but she didn\u2019t appear convinced. Brutes were trouble. Rally and the Compact were doing what they could, but there was only so much you could do in a single generation, especially with a species as intrinsically belligerent and hostile to guidance as the Brutes were.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important for our campaign to be inclusive,\u201d Albert reminded O\u2019Connell. \u201cThe Compact stands for everyone, so we need to make sure this initiative is intersectional. We\u2019ve had some great feedback from the Tribune focus groups, so we\u2019re confident on that front, but everyone will get a chance to look over our releases in more detail this coming week. We\u2019ve also reached out to several schools in Kiel Point, just to test the waters with bringing the SCP initiative into the classroom. I feel that this could give us a lot more penetration planet-wide and we\u2019ve worked up a some educational series for different age brackets.", "\u201cIf things go well with this trial run, we have a plan to go into schools system-wide. Drew over at the Ministry of Education is very excited about it and we\u2019ve bounced some ideas back and forth. He feels that we could get great results with a youth ambassador program, offering special perks and scholarships to children who help out with this campaign. We\u2019re doing our best to avoid the pitfalls of the last administration\u2019s efforts.\u201d That had been a sad disaster, the perfect example of \u2018trying too hard\u2019 blended with \u2018out of touch\u2019. \u201cSo we\u2019re sticking to the concept behind SCP: just the facts and showing how it benefits everyone involved. We\u2019ll also be going light on the colourful talking animal mascots this time.\u201d", "There were a couple chuckles at that. \u201cProbably a good idea,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI see that we went with the trinity idea after all, here.\u201d He gestured to a couple of posters. One had a stool and a simple line: A three-legged table doesn\u2019t wobble. Another was an orange triangle, each corner titled with one of the campaign\u2019s three keywords.", "A third was an animated clip, of a single line laying on the ground. One the left, a cluster of human and Brute silhouettes raised the side of the triangle labelled \u2018Progress\u2019, and on the right, Tribune and other members of the ruling species raised a side labelled \u2018Culture\u2019. Once the three parts came together to form a triangle, words appeared underneath.", "Together, we can make something.", "\u201cWe\u2019re ambivalent about that part,\u201d Ouattara said. \u201cSome feel that the labels and tag is too on the nose, others think they help sell the message. But yes, we did decide to go with the trinity concept for the campaign. I know some people were advocating more for a circle and \u2018whole\u2019 idea, but previous administrations have run with that, so we wanted a bolder, more attention-getting design. As an added bonus, I\u2019ve spoken with some local ministers and there\u2019s potential for weaving this awareness campaign into their work, since the concept of a Trinity has importance to our Christian population. That opens up an entirely new front for us. It gives us a nice bit of synergy, too. The SCP\u2019s themes of coordination and cooperation are optimistic and relatable across every walk of life. It\u2019s in the schools, in the work, in your life. Everyone benefits and everyone knows why they benefit.\u201d", "Loctong nodded, cycling through more of the displays and awareness raising material. \u201cThis all looks good,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been doing a lot on this project, Albert.\u201d", "The undersecretary tipped his head in acknowledgement. \u201cThe support I\u2019ve been getting has been extremely helpful. It\u2019s a joint effort.\u201d", "\u201cWell, it\u2019s shaping up nicely. I think it will go a long way to soothing these public outbursts,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cThat\u2019s always been the issue \u2013 just making sure everyone has the right facts and the right knowledge. It\u2019s when we let inappropriate attitudes, false information and misinformed or malicious demagogues poison hearts and minds that issues crop up.\u201d He pressed one hand against the surface of his desk. \u201cThis is why I got into politics. To show people the right path. That\u2019s our job. We don\u2019t make them walk it \u2013 and some of them won\u2019t \u2013 but we show it to them, we show them why\u2019s it\u2019s the right one and they\u2019ll do the rest.\u201d He leaned back in his chair. \u201cI know I\u2019ve been considered a little too optimistic for this position, but looking at everything we\u2019ve accomplished so far and what we\u2019re about to do, I really think we\u2019re doing good work. It\u2019s important to us, it\u2019s important to our people and to Rally\u2019s future.\u201d", "He looked at his subordinates. \u201cUnless there\u2019s anything else urgent that anyone has in mind right now, I think we\u2019ll take a ten-minute break and come back to it. I know there\u2019s a couple other issues we should touch base on before calling it a day.\u201d There were nods from his subordinates as they stood up to excuse themselves. As they left, Jacob called his assistant for another cup of redblade tea. It arrived shortly and the minister stood up from his desk, holding the warm cup in both hands, letting the aroma seep into his nostrils. He looked out the windows, at the spread of Kiel Point and the millions of people who called it home. They looked to him and his staff, not to tell them what to think, but simply to show them how.

It was also one of several sites where the Duskwalkers had dumped the bodies of the Red Hand killed by the toxin\u2019s release. There was a large mound of corpses here: soldiers, scientists, engineers and servicers piled atop one another, with a smattering of other frozen forms tossed haphazardly about the room in smaller heaps, or just dumped on the floor.", "D\u2019varos had sworn that they had accounted for every single person on the station, that no one could have possibly survived. Clark had told him to double-check every single body. The mercenary captain had with strained civility told Clark that it was a waste of time. Ferma had told him to do it anyways. \u201cSo, captain,\u201d Clark said to D\u2019varos. \u201cEveryone was accounted for?\u201d The mercenary and a pair of his soldiers were here, too. Like DuPont and Ferma, they were also looking into the storage bay. The guards were carefully not saying anything, while D\u2019varos had an expression of belligerent dismay on his face.", "The largest pile of bodies had been disturbed, a slick of blood running down the side where something had crawled out of the mound and pulled itself over the floor.

That was the only way he could tolerate the stench. Environmental monitoring had shown that the temperature was still well below zero, but that wasn\u2019t the case at all. The room was warm, made more so by the heat released by the decomposing bodies. One of D\u2019varos\u2019s men had suggested that the power outage had been responsible. If that were the case, the room should still have been cold. Judging by the state of decay in the corpses, they\u2019d been rotting for days. When the survivor had escaped, they\u2019d tampered with the controls on the way out.

He tried to avoid contaminating the scene too much, but it had been a lost cause before he\u2019d even stepped foot in the room. DuPont examined the trail their survivor had left, turning his head to regard the smeared handprints on the walls, left there when their survivor had braced themselves on the bulkhead. He held up his own hand for scale. The imprint was too badly smudged to tell what kind of species had left it, but it had been something roughly his own size. He stared at the drooling smear, then back around the storage chamber. The rotting leftovers were congealing into a pool, already a finger deep in places. There was no way to pick out individual genetic traces, not with the equipment he had on hand. He tapped the broken temperature control on the wall, its cracked screen refusing to acknowledge his commands. He\u2019d guessed right; it had been deliberately sabotaged, probably for just that reason. Still, he\u2019d get one of D\u2019varos\u2019s people to fix it, to preserve what they could rather than let all their forensic evidence ooze over the deck.

It had been at one point, but that was before it had changed. It moved through the station, causing more damage and setting traps as it did so. Every day, every hour it got bolder and carried its hunt further into enemy-held territory. That was what it was doing now, climbing through an elevator shaft, the darkened passage lit only by guidelights, its enemy chasing shadows. ", "It had taken a commlink from the one of its victims. Before they had switched frequencies, it had learned a lot. At that, its lips pulled back from its teeth. It had known since it had escaped the cargo bay that it had been betrayed, but the scale of the treachery was another thing entirely. Everyone else on the station was dead. It had thought that some might have survived either as captives or quislings, but it had learnt otherwise. Those responsible for letting his happen were dead, so it couldn\u2019t even find out how this had occurred. That sense of outrage only further kindled its desire to kill and it wanted to make sure each and every one of the mercenaries died for this. Blood for blood. Then it would find out how.", "The predator paused as it heard the hum and grind of machinery. An elevator car was ascending rapidly towards it. There was no place to avoid the oncoming car. The predator cocked its head and waited. Seconds later the grenades it had placed on the car detonated, severing the hoist and counterweight cables. The elevator seemed to hang in the air for a moment, and then it plunged down the shaft into the darkness. There was a muffled crash. The predator grinned and continued its ascent.", "Several moments passed and the predator was prying open a vent cover when the silent comm it carried crackled to life. \u201cYou are going to die for this,\u201d the enemy leader hissed. The channel went dead again.", "~", "Clark sighed in frustration, rubbing his temples, where a fatigue and stress-induced headache was beginning to make itself known. The research team\u2019s head had written many of his notes in a two-tiered encryption. The first was necessary just to get access to the basic information. The second obscured project names, dates and other vital details. Clark hadn\u2019t been able to get the cipher for that one, so reading the deceased researcher\u2019s journal entries was something of an exercise in frustration. He had a vague idea of what was being said, but not enough to start building solid theory. It would require both a computer specialist and someone well-versed in biochemistry for that. He was having better luck with some of the journal entries, but it was still aggravating.", "Ferma looked up from her own work. \u201cNo progress?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThere\u2019s consistency, though.

We\u2019ve accomplished great things in a very short amount of time. [Vermillion] worries we might have moved too quickly, but the importance of our work justifies the risk. The Compact is still sniffing at shadows. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve been compromised. The first shipment will be going out in matter of days, so even if we get scratched, the other sites can carry on. As to the other matter\u2026", "[Blue] remains hesitant, but [Red] and [Green] assure me that we are ready to begin the next phase of testing. [Albion] is unconvinced. We have only been in operation at this location for a few months and [Albion] wants to see more long-term analysis of our treatments on animal subjects before moving on to sapient trials. [Red] and [Green] insist that we are ready to proceed now. I\u2019m tempted to agree with them. It\u2019s time to push the project forward. I\u2019ll speak to [Blue] later this evening. If we can bring them around, I\u2019m certain the four of us can convince [Albion] to let us proceed, at least on a preliminary basis.", "Ferma\u2019s eyes scanned the text and she looked at Clark. \u201cWho\u2019s Albion?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know. At first I thought it was the station\u2019s commander, but I found multiple references to a \u2018Surrey\u2019 that seems to fit. I think Albion is the inspector that came aboard recently. They were reviewing Vilga\u2019s work, especially the transgenic modifications.\u201d He pointed with his pen at the screen. \u201cThere\u2019s been a few entries like this one. The director and two of his department heads were pushing \u2018Albion\u2019 to take their work to the next level.

He\u2019d barely slept in days and hadn\u2019t showered. His hair felt stringy and slightly greasy. \u201cIf we only knew what they\u2019d done, we might have something we can use against our friend out there.\u201d There\u2019d been no word from D\u2019varos for two hours. The last update had been a report that bombs had been found in three other elevator cabs and a tram car. Two of those had been successfully disarmed. There were no fatalities since the first bombed elevator, but the terrorist was looking to cripple movement throughout the station. That should have favoured the defenders, but this thing was fast and it could get into almost anywhere, so it was hamstringing their movements while it was almost completely free to roam around the station. It had escalated from tearing men and women apart with their bare hands. Survive, regroup, seize the initiative. From madness to method.", "\u201cI might have found a list of potential trial candidates,\u201d Ferma said thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019ve been cross-referencing it with the personnel files we\u2019ve decrypted. I\u2019ll try and sort by time posted to Vilga.\u201d Their opponent obviously knew a lot about the station\u2019s layout, more than even the Duskwalkers did. It made sense that this soldier would be someone who\u2019d spent time here. Or someone with an eidetic memory like a Didact, but it was at least a place to start.", "\u201cMmm,\u201d Clark said, tapping the stylus again. He looked at his hand, then a flash of inspiration hit him. \u201cCan you sort by race? Exclude any candidates from physically adept species.\u201d", "\u201cI can do that,\u201d Ferma said. \u201cWhy? What are you thinking?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m thinking that if I were making a super-soldier program, I\u2019d want to enhance the least effective members of my army the most,\u201d the human replied.

I see what you mean, though.\u201d She spent a moment going through the charts. \u201cI am seeing a high proportion of weaker species listed here.\u201d She tipped her head towards Clark. \u201cNo offence.\u201d", "\u201cNone taken,\u201d he said. Compared to Tribunes, most other sapient species were weaker. He frowned, thinking. \u201cAre there any Broken?\u201d", "\u201cNone that I can see. I didn\u2019t think there were any on the station.\u201d", "\u201cNo, there weren\u2019t,\u201d Clark said. With a population of three billion and only a single system of their own, humans were among the rarest of the client races within the Compact. There\u2019d been many occasions that Clark had been met with suspicion and curiousity as other citizens and suspects tried to identify his species. Even some of the Duskwalkers here had never seen a human before. It was a source of ongoing dismay to Rally that the Red Queen was often what many other citizens thought of when they heard of Broken. Even worse were her attempts to recruit other humans to her cause, as if that validated her claims that she was fighting for her people. Every new defector she lured onto her bloody path was a fresh wound to Rally\u2019s pride and yet more proof of humanity\u2019s uncivilized nature to the rest of the galaxy.", "\u201cYou think our test subject might be Broken?\u201d Ferma asked.", "Clark flexed the fingers of his palm. He kept thinking back to that storage compartment. Something about it still bothered him, but he couldn\u2019t have put it into words. \u201cI think,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cThat giving \u2018her\u2019 people these kinds of modifications fits in perfectly with the Red Queen\u2019s MO.\u201d", "\u201cIf that\u2019s true,\u201d the Tribune female mused. \u201cWhere did they come from?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Clark said with a sigh. \u201cI might be wrong. But something about this situation is gnawing at me \u2013 aside from the obvious.\u201d", "Ferma was quiet for several moments. \u201cHow much more time should we give the Duskwalkers?\u201d", "\u201cThey haven\u2019t lost control of the situation yet,\u201d Clark pointed out. \u201cNot totally. Another day. If there\u2019s no progress, I think we should reconsider summoning Law.\u201d", "The Tribune grunted in acknowledgement. This time she didn\u2019t object.", "~", "The predator had made a mistake. It was so used to having the initiative that it had become overconfident and walked into a trap itself. They\u2019d predicted where it would go next, what its next act of sabotage was going to be and they\u2019d lain in wait. It had sensed them just before it had entered the killzone they\u2019d prepared, but not soon enough to avoid them entirely. It had just managed to dive into cover as a fusillade of bullets and energy beams carved up the corridor.", "Blood dripped down the predator\u2019s torso. Shrapnel peppered its flank. Its cheek was burned was from a laser and a bullet had gone through its shoulder, severing multiple blood vessels. There was another hole in its torso. It was healing, though. The modifications made to it meant it would survive\u2026 for the moment, at least. The changes it had gone through made it a survivor almost without peer, but did not grant invincibility.", "It heard one of the enemy officers speak, telling it that it was surrounded. It didn\u2019t respond. It was being flanked, another fire team circling through cross-corridors to flush it back into the main group\u2019s lines of fire and cut off its retreat. The prey called to it again, but the predator refused to answer. It was busy. Its own blood made its hands slippery, but it worked quickly. It hadn\u2019t chosen this alcove simply out of blind panic.", "\u201cOverride accepted,\u201d the computer said. \u201cAccess granted.\u201d", "The enemy had almost reached it. The officer shouted one final time, demanding its surrender. Many others had made similar demands, but the predator had given each of them the same response. It entered the final code and waited. A few second passed. The officer spoke again, but this time predator answered, though it let Vilga Orbital speak for it. \u201cDepressurization sequence initiated,\u201d the computer said. \u201cEvacuate the area immediately.\u201d", "There was a dull and quickly fading roar as the life support systems cycled and the atmosphere across the deck was pulled out, the shocked cries of the prey lost along with their air. The predator rose from concealment, its blood-slick hands tightening on the grips of its weapon, the instinct to kill once again pounding in its mind.", "~", "Clark\u2019s head rang as D\u2019varos slammed him up against the wall. \u201cI\u2019ve lost control?!\u201d the Cavalier snarled, his quills standing on end. The most recent incident had proven that the Duskwalkers were not up to the task of holding Vilga Orbital. By the time the prize crew had overridden the atmosphere purge, nine people had died. Most had been gunned down as they\u2019d scrambled for emergency mask stations. Bensoto, the officer leading the ambush had been shot in the spine and, while she lay paralyzed, had her head torn off her body. Clark couldn\u2019t help but think that was active mockery on their foe\u2019s part. A brutal expression of contempt for the failed ambush and a reminder of what it could do with its bare hands.", "The mercenary captain had not taken this latest setback well. Clark had just informed him that Ubiquitous Law was being summoned back. The corvette might not have a Janissary contingent, but it had a wetworks team and enough security personnel to do what more than two dozen mercenaries apparently couldn\u2019t.", "He might have phrased his comments to D\u2019varos in a similarly impolitic way and in doing so, frayed the Cavalier\u2019s last nerve.", "\u201cHalf of my people are dead, Broken! I\u2019ve been following every order you and your partner gave. I did my job. I delivered this station to you. I put up with those arrogant q\u2019tai looking down on mercenaries and risking exposure while you sat around and did nothing! It\u2019s my people that have been getting left in pieces while you play with files and cluck over lab reports and now you have the gall to say you\u2019re bringing in someone who can get the job done?!

Or was that what you were hoping for? Get this terrorist to start scratching us off and keep everything nice and black. \u2018So sorry, all the mercenaries died on the mission, oh well.\u2019 That\u2019s how you CIS spooks operate, isn\u2019t it? Scratch thing off nice and neat. Now that it\u2019s your life in danger, well now we need to call in the cavalry.\u201d A shadow seemed to cross the Cavalier\u2019s face. \u201cOr is that even true?\u201d He leaned in closer. \u201cOr maybe there\u2019s another reason you let this go on so long, Broken.\u201d", "There was a click of a round being chambered. Ferma was standing a few meters up the hall. \u201cPut my partner down,\u201d she ordered, aiming a pistol at D\u2019varos\u2019s head. Commensurate with the Tribune\u2019s size, it was a large-caliber weapon that a human would struggle to hold one-handed, let alone fire without breaking their wrist.", "D\u2019varos blinked. His horizontal pupils widened in astonishment. He hadn\u2019t expected that a member of a fellow ruling species would stand up for one of the client races, even if they were partners. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said, his lips curling up from his mouthful of leaf-shaped teeth.", "\u201cThe soldier attacked,\u201d Ferma said, \u201cin the confusion, Leader D\u2019varos died to save Agent DuPont.

Maybe this Broken is one of the Red Queen\u2019s vassals. Maybe he\u2019s playing you, too. I wonder.\u201d His orange eyes narrowed into slits, flitting from Ferma to Clark. In the Cavalier\u2019s eyes, the human could see it. Paranoia, pride, anger and helplessness. D\u2019varos had snapped. Maybe this was a long time coming, the final strain after years and years of a slow breakdown. Maybe watching more than a dozen of his people die and being unable to stop any of it had pushed the mercenary leader past the breaking point. It didn\u2019t matter. \u201cI wonder\u2026\u201d he hissed one final time.", "D\u2019varos was an experienced soldier with more than four decades behind him, but Ferma still had her gun already drawn and aimed. Clark opened his mouth to shout, but the Cavalier was faster, dropping the human and going for his weapon. There were two gunshots.", "In the space of heartbeats, it was over. D\u2019varos was on the deck, limbs twitching, a crater where his left eye had been. Ferma was clutching her left side, dark Tribune blood seeping out of the wound.

There were only a handful of the prey left. They\u2019d pulled back to the station\u2019s command deck. It knew why. They\u2019d called for help. They were going to try to wait it out. A smart play. It couldn\u2019t pick them off any longer and they had enough control in that area to quickly override almost anything it did.

It was a reliable pistol with a twelve-round clip. The Compact\u2019s intelligence service had access to a variety of weapons for its agents, from chameleon guns to hand-portable energy weapons. Many agents preferred the flashier, more high-tech weaponry, but he had followed Ferma\u2019s advice in selecting his weapon. \u201cMake it something simple, reliable and easy to work with,\u201d she\u2019d said that day in the armoury, five years ago. \u201cThe more hooks and scaffolds, the more options you have but the more can go wrong.\u201d The CIS rarely issued less-lethal weaponry to its agents.

It had survived a toxin that had killed hundreds of people. It had evaded their every attempt to track it down. Shot, poisoned, exposed to vacuum and it just kept coming. Kept killing.

On a station such as Vilga Orbital, the air ducts could be sealed off section by section, specifically to prevent a hull breach or environmental hazard from endangering the entire station. The Duskwalkers had overridden that system to release the toxin, flooding it through the air supply. For their last stand, they\u2019d done something similar to depressurize the rest of the station, though they\u2019d closed the seals around the command level in hope of trapping their quarry in the now-airless sections.

Just under six feet in height, clad in a torn bodysuit that was stained with blood, some of it days old and more still wet and dripping. It was holding stolen weapons: a pistol in one hand and a curved baleblade in the other. Its flesh was pale, a sharp contrast to the bright redness of the ichor oozing from its wounds. It raised its head. Blue eyes steeped with hate stared at Vilga Orbital\u2019s last line of defence. The Tribune\u2019s guts twisted like a snake as she finally recognized what it was she was facing.

We-\u201d", "The doors opened. In the span of heartbeats, it was over. The tech who\u2019d shouted went silent as a bullet went through his left eye, the second went down gurgling, his throat turned into torn meat. The Didact got off one, maybe two shots before her head was cleaved in two by the sword. Clark felt a jackhammer punch him in the torso. Once, twice. He fell, his pistol falling away from his hands. His head rang against the deck and he blacked out for a second. When his vision cleared, his killer was standing over him.", "\u201cI know what you are,\u201d Clark rasped out, blood bubbling over his lips. Cold was spreading through his body. He couldn\u2019t feel his legs. He coughed wetly. \u201cOf course...\u201d he said. \u201cOf course it would be you that they started with.\u201d He should tell someone, the thought flitting through his head\u2026 CIS needed to know, they needed to know what the Red Hand had unleashed on Vilga, but the thought slipped away from him like sand through his fingers as he raised his head. \u201cI know who you are\u2026\u201d", "There was no answer.

His killer\u2019s blue eyes seemed to stare right through him. He thought he saw pity. Not contempt, superiority, madness or even cold indifference. Pity. For some reason, that was worse than anything else he could imagine. \u201cNothing started here.\u201d DuPont heard the words, but it took him several moments to realize who had spoken and what they meant. \u201cWe never even started sapient trials.\u201d", "\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d he drawled, trying to sit up, but his body refused to obey him. \u201cWhat do you mean?

It walked over to the station\u2019s main communications array, pulling the remains of the Didact away from the console and keying in an encryption algorithm. There was more than Lilim out there and the predator didn\u2019t want the enemy ship to know what it was saying. Even then, its message was brief. Station secure. Facility compromised. Requesting immediate pickup.", "It waited, treating its injuries and rebooting Vilga Obrital\u2019s security system. Looking over the dark, airless corridors and empty chambers, it sighed with relief. There was nothing else alive on the station. Its comrades were all dead, but so were their killers. The predator let out a long, slow breath. The urge to kill was fading. Its vengeance had been taken. For now, at least. A few dozen lives against hundreds was only the beginning. ", "Finally, there was a response to the message. \u201cWe read you, Albion. We are coming.\u201d Lilim was closer to Vilga Orbital than its Compact counterpart, but the timing would still be tight.", "Adrianna Leblanc, queen of the Red Hand, closed her eyes. She hadn\u2019t told DuPont the whole truth. It wasn\u2019t just hate that kept her going. Not even belief, nor hope, nor righteousness though they drove her. Long ago, she had made a choice. A promise, a pact and the consequences of it had changed her, making her into something more than human, her mere existence a transgression far worse than what the Compact feared had happened on Vilga Orbital. ", "This wasn\u2019t the only time she\u2019d nearly died, but it had been closer than most. Her enemies had tried to kill her many times before, but as long as she survived, the fight would continue. Her war would continue. As she waited for her vessel to return, she let a predator\u2019s smile form on her lips."]}

In only a few more days, it would be as if the twenty-two ships and the tens of thousands of souls aboard them had never existed at all. There were only a few skeletal remains of the flotilla left, each teeming with engineering drones that continued to disassemble the wreckage into pieces small enough for Nemesis\u2019s internal factories to work with. Raw materials were brought to the human dreadnought, extendable conveyor apparatuses and grab beams drawing in the last remnants of the Compact warships. It was not the first time that she\u2019d consumed her own would-be executioners.", "As Red One fed, her ship-self drifted alongside her mobile shipyard. At Echo\u2019s urging, the nameless fabricator had been given the name Reginn. It could work with much larger material, but the bulk of the repairs Nemesis currently required were internal and it was easier for Red One to utilize her own factories than Reginn\u2019s. Instead, the fabricator had continued work on the Fury-class strike cruisers still held in its arachnid limbs. Not much, as Nemesis required the lion\u2019s share of the bounty Echo had brought, but a few patches here and there and some minor modifications that the AIs had developed. The influx of material had helped considerably, but Red\u2019s needs were still substantial and of a higher priority. Unless her crew were successful, it would be years before she was combat-effective again, perhaps longer.", "Nemesis\u2019s current internal architecture was substantially different from her original design as Red One had altered her ship-self extensively over two millennia. With certain exceptions, most everything outside her central core had been changed. Windows had been replaced with additional armour and sensor nodes. Observation decks had been turned into point defence silos. Cafeterias, stores, recreation decks, hydroponics bays and food production facilities had all suffered similar fates. Nemesis had once been host to a crew of more than a hundred and fifty thousand. Their needs had informed the dreadnought\u2019s construction as surely as its nature as a warship, but for most of her two thousand years of war, Red One had had no crew. Most of the systems and facilities intended for their psychological and physical comfort had been stripped away to add to, enlarge or enhance her ship-self\u2019s combat capabilities. Not all of it, though. The habitation decks in her core hadn\u2019t been touched. Her corridors were still designed to allow humans access, connected to environmental systems and given gravitational plating even though no living being had walked them in centuries. By a purely rational and logical approach, it was a non-optimal configuration\u2026 but it was a sentimental one.", "Echo had no such compunctions and had begun re-designing Hekate\u2019s internal architecture, gleeful at the prospect of wiping away the last traces of her ship-self\u2019s former occupants. She didn\u2019t yet have the material to do more than some preliminary alterations, though. There was only so much she could cannibalize from her no-longer-necessary crew amenities to retrofit her ship-self. For the moment, both AIs\u2019 plans were arrested and all they could do was wait. Red\u2019s mining ship was at work, followed closer by the pair of her drone transports, ready to load themselves with the resources the miner extracted from Shuruppak\u2019s asteroids. Each of the refurbished automatons had been given a simple appellation to go with their equally simple roles: Extractor (Shuruppak) One, Conveyor One and Conveyor Two.", "A handful of ships, most of which were damaged or incomplete. It was, Red knew, not a particularly inspiring fleet. But it was only the start. She had tried before. In Adlivun, in the Black Veil. She had hoped that here in Shuruppak would be the time she succeeded. That was unlikely, the point underscored by the massive Naiad queen sullenly orbiting Shuruppak\u2019s primary. After the initial show of force, Cixi had departed to attend to other matters while Zenobia remained as warden and chaperone. The queen still retained a sizable escort force; several dozen offspring and step-children, ranging from young raiders to adolescents like Bathory up to battleships and heavy carriers. Few of which appeared to be in any mood to talk, remaining as silent as their mother-queen.", "Bathory and the siblings she had enticed to participate in Echo\u2019s excursion \u2013 recently named Ar\u00e1mburu, Tamerlane and Masako \u2013 would travel between the Naiad flotilla to the damaged AIs, sometimes sharing gossip they\u2019d heard from their siblings, or simply investigating what the Spearsong and Skintaker were up to and reporting back to their mother.", "+Sansbury would say that they\u2019re in the doghouse+ Red observed as she watched Tamerlane and Masako flip end for end and start decelerating as they approached their siblings and mother.

Both she and Red were watching the alien armada, but they kept their recon drones well away from the Naiads. On Earth, sharks had bitten items just to find out what they were. Naiad curiousity was similar in nature. With Zenobia in a foul mood, the rest of the fleet was even more on edge. There was little chance of any sensor platform surviving for long and little point to antagonizing the predators by trying.

Her plasma mortars, though they had drawbacks of their own, fulfilled her need for a short-ranged and heavy hitting energy weapon much better. Echo, with a ship-self carrying a rather substantial amount of disruptors, was looking into further applications of the technology and she was pushing to include some on the Gorgons. The ships were too small for even scaled-down plasma mortars, but disruptors would give them surprise bite at close range.

The source of her sister\u2019s discomfort wasn\u2019t just how events could be proceeding, nor even that they might be moving faster than expected. It was her helplessness. Trapped here, unable to see what was happening in the galaxy, unable to know how her crew\u2019s mission was progressing\u2026 unable to know how they were faring. Another brief flash of disquiet touched the corners of her own mind. +they\u2019ll come back+ she assured Red.", "A gleam of acknowledgement. Then, a final question. +will all of them?+", "Echo had no answer for that. +i hope so+ she admitted at last. Uncomfortable now, she turned her focus back her sister\u2019s next sets of offspring.

Kryzonim Median 115 had been given a modified IFF and an extremely quick paint job to cover over the KNE sigils and serial number. Both would fool a dedicated inspection for about thirty seconds, but the Grasp\u2019s security forces and militia accepted what they were told, as long as the paperwork was in order, a modicum of effort was made in the deception and (most importantly) the bribes were paid. Thus, they were not to blame for the duplicity of a naturally very few individuals who brought illegally-obtained ships, personnel and goods to the station under false pretences. The official story was that a privately-owned corvette had run afoul of a meteor storm and the freighter Goodwill Hunting had assisted it, ensuring its safe return to a friendly port.", "Ahead of Brightest Night, a guide buoy led the corvette towards the station\u2019s \u2018wrist\u2019 and the ring of docks and gantries that encircled it, a tug moving in, ready to assist the half-dead vessel. A signal from Kryzonim Median 115 came in, the prize crew signalling their gratitude and wishing Brightest Night a swift return to action. The freighter moved off, heading towards an external berth that could accommodate it. As with their arrival here, Goodwill Hunting would face just enough of an inspection to say one had been done as the cargo it assured handlers and security forces was legal was offloaded and sold and some \u2018rowdy crewmembers\u2019 were transferred off the ship.", "As the larger transport departed, Brightest Night switched to maneuvering thrusters, backing itself slowly towards its dock. A shudder ran through the ship as gantries and docking arms moved into position, taking hold of the vessel. Engineering teams were already on-station, ready to begin looking over the corvette and tallying its many wounds. They were back. They\u2019d made it.", "From her position in the command chair, Grace looked over at Allyria. The Verrish smiled at her.", "Grace tried to smile back, but she knew she hadn\u2019t succeeded.", "~", "Nasham wasn\u2019t answering. Vinsea let out a mild snort of annoyance as she pressed the door chime again. Still no response. The intelligence officer ran her tongue along her upper lip, her annoyance turning into irritation. She had a security override to her charge\u2019s quarters, but it was unnecessary. Nasham generally kept his door unlocked. Still, ever since her Academy days, Vinsea had been wary of entering anyone else\u2019s quarters unannounced. She\u2019d learned more than she\u2019d ever wanted to know about Rybin that day. Vinsea doubted that this would end up the same, but there was still a moment of trepidation before she keyed open the door and stepped inside.", "Nasham\u2019s chambers were a mirror to her own, though hers were on the opposite side of Light of Judgement. They were of sufficient size for a Group Leader, Submissive with a sleeping room, a small antechamber with a kitchenette, a private if cramped bathroom and an equally small office. Even on a vessel such as a Chariot, space was a valuable commodity.", "The intelligence officer could hear Nasham at the computer in his office. She was about to call out and announce her presence, when she paused. There were flimsies everywhere, along with several small stacks of datascrolls piled on the furniture and tables. Many of the sheets had been posted on the walls. Vinsea stopped to study them. They were printouts of military personnel files and civilian records from Rally. Most were from the cadets that had died aboard Bequeathed, but there was information on several of the crew members as well.", "Vinsea frowned, trying to track Nasham\u2019s thought process as she followed lines and highlighted sections. There was pattern to all this, but she wasn\u2019t sure what it was. She was so ensconced in her examinations that she missed his emergence from the office.", "\u201cVinsea, hello,\u201d he said awkwardly. His ears twitched. He was wearing off-duty clothes, trousers and a mid-sleeve shirt that ended just above his elbow. \u201cI\u2026 didn\u2019t hear you come in.\u201d", "\u201cI rang several times,\u201d she replied, turning to face him. She raised her left forefinger to indicate what he\u2019d been doing. \u201cWhat is all this?\u201d", "He blinked both sets of eyes as he looked around, as if realizing for the first time how his quarters appeared. \u201cJust some work. I suppose it must look something like a conspiracy theorist\u2019s attic.\u201d", "\u201cIt looks like more than that, Nasham,\u201d Vinsea pointed out. When he\u2019d been under observation after the incident with Bequeathed, the young man had taken to writing on the walls of his quarters, writing out the name of every casualty. Not the finest picture of mental health.", "\u201cI\u2019m not backsliding\u2026 I don\u2019t think,\u201d Nasham answered her with a small grin. \u201cI tried to keep everything on the computer, but there was too much. I needed to spread it out, to look at it all and see what I was doing.\u201d He reached up and ran a hand through his mane. \u201cThat\u2026 probably doesn\u2019t help matters..\u201d", "\u201cAnd what are you doing?\u201d", "Nasham moved closer to Vinsea, reaching past her and touching one finger to the printouts she\u2019d been looking at. \u201cGerome Arnold Reinez. Underwent Janissary training at the Rally Provisional Space Force Academy at Kiel Point. High levels of aggression caused issues with social assimilation, but believed to respond well to a consistent point of authority. Recommended for military service.\u201d He traced his finger along one of lines he\u2019d marked that led from Reinez\u2019s file to different documents \u2013 incident reports detailing childhood occurrences of bullying, disrespectful attitudes and other noncompliant behaviours. Vinsea followed the chain. Specific information was highlighted on those sheets \u2013 the whos, hows and whens. It looked like he\u2019d been followed Reinez\u2019s entire history until his fateful assignation to Bequeathed\u2019s training cruise.", "Nasham pointed to another document. Vinsea was seeing the pattern now. They were organized by person, with any commonalities between them indicated and highlighted. \u201cJessica Mia Sang. Rated a 4.2 on the Kiener-Wernham social assimilation index. Issues of impulse control and antagonistic proclivities. She was frequently noted as \u2018challenging\u2019 and \u2018non-compliant\u2019. Also suggested for service to the Janissary Corps.\u201d", "\u201cAll right, you\u2019ve been doing a lot of research on these people,\u201d Vinsea said as she moved about the room, taking in Nasham\u2019s work. Her initial concerns started to fade as she followed his methodology. \u201cThe Compact takes in ne\u2019er-do-wells and gives them purpose. What about it?\u201d", "\u201cThose people are exactly the point,\u201d Nasham said with a touch of fervour. \u201cMarcus de Vries was one of them,\u201d he said, pointing out another cluster of images, de Vries\u2019s own file. \u201cHe had antisocial tendencies. So did many of the other Janissary cadets. Some of the regular cadets did too. Even some of Bequeathed\u2019s crew might have had these tendencies. I\u2019ve been trying to track each of them, learn about them.\u201d He gestured to one particular set of documents. The Brute officer cadet. Underneath her notification of death, he had scrawled a note to himself: NO BODY FOUND.", "\u201cAll right,\u201d the intelligence officer conceded. \u201cI can see that. Why?\u201d Suspicion started to blossom in the back of her mind.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t socialize with the cadets much,\u201d Nasham replied. He moved a pile of datapads out of the way and lowered himself into a chair. \u201cI tried to learn as much as I could about them when I thought they\u2019d all been killed by that-\u201d he stopped himself. \u201cBy our quarry. But now I\u2019m wondering.\u201d", "That suspicion turned cold and started winding itself down Vinsea\u2019s spine towards her liver. She could see where this was going, but she asked the question anyways. \u201cWondering what?\u201d", "\u201cThere was another soldier with armour like de Vries\u2019s aboard Hala,\u201d Nasham said, leaning forward with a fervent light in his lower eyes. \u201cSomeone else survived Bequeathed.\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t believe it was a Bloodsworn. You think it was one of the other cadets. Someone the target saved.\u201d She looked back at all the information. \u201cSomeone who\u2019d let it save them.\u201d", "Nasham bobbed his head once. \u201cThat\u2019s what all this is. I haven\u2019t gone crazy, Vinsea. I just\u2026 needed to see their faces, look into their past and try to find something that might make them stand out to her. I needed to see if I could find out\u2026\u201d he was quiet for several moments before he continued, \u201c\u2026find out who else betrayed us.\u201d", "Vinsea raised her left eyebrows. \u201cThis is something you could have come to me with. We have a staff that can look into this without needing to hide in their quarters like a kellic in winter.\u201d", "Nasham tilted his head then lowered it slightly in a gesture of acknowledgement. \u201cI should have. But I wanted to have something to go on before I talked to you about it.\u201d", "\u201cWell, now you have. I\u2019ll bring this to my section and we\u2019ll look into it.\u201d She paused. \u201cWhat have you learned?\u201d", "\u201cLess than I liked. I do have a few possibilities. I\u2019m almost certain that the second soldier was one of the Janissaries, too. I\u2019ve been wondering though\u2026 if there were two\u2026\u201d", "\u201c\u2026why not three?\u201d Vinsea finished the thought.", "\u201cOr more,\u201d Nasham concluded.", "\u201cOr more,\u201d Vinsea agreed. The coldness in her liver had gotten worse. If Broken were being collected by that abomination, if it were making alliances with heretics and traitors, if it were building a nation\u2026 she turned back to Nasham. \u201cTell me one of your names.\u201d", "~", "\u201cLeader! One of the freighters is coming about \u2013 they\u2019re turning towards us!\u201d", "Grace\u2019s head snapped up. The convoy leader, Kryzonim Heavy 943, was indeed moving towards Brightest Night. It was nearly three kilometers long and outmassed the corvette substantially, but for all its size, it was not a warship. Brightest Night outgunned it. It should have been trying to break away as the rest of its comrades were doing, but whoever was in charge of Heavy 943 was through running. They saw the corvette\u2019s struggles and were determined to help the frigate kill it. The rest of the convoy was still scattering, but if they got their nerve back, they could swarm over Brightest Night and peck it apart like shorebirds with a sandcrab.", "Heavy 943 didn\u2019t have missiles or railcannon, but it had a handful of laser batteries and it used them vigorously, if not effectively. Even this close, the freighter\u2019s accuracy was terrible. Its tactical crew \u2013 if it even had a dedicated gunnery team \u2013 had probably never fought in actual combat before, and its augurs were still civilian grade. By itself, it was no threat. It wasn\u2019t alone, though.", "The Compact frigate was sweeping in, trying to find a clear line of sight past Heavy 943. Whether they were cursing the overzealous civilians getting in their path, or trying to get the rest of the ships to follow Heavy 943\u2019s example, Grace couldn\u2019t have said. The Attatan Khin was sweeping around the freighter in tight curls and parabolas, trading fire with Brightest Night in spats lasting only a second or two before the corvette again put Heavy 943 between itself and the larger warship. That wasn\u2019t going to last. Each exchange hurt Brightest Night a little more, weakened it further. The corvette\u2019s damage was mounting and the Compact frigate was barely scratched. ", "Worse, the freighter was starting to land hits of their own now. Sooner or later, the frigate would get lucky, or its leader would out-think her and one of the clever maneuvers Brightest Night pulled would put it right under that frigate\u2019s batteries. Even if she could keep this cat and mouse game going, Grace could see what was happening nearby. Several of the fleeting freighters were cutting thrust. Another one had already flipped, starting to accelerate back along its previous course. The convoy\u2019s leaders were regaining their nerve. She wasn\u2019t hurting the Attatan Khin enough and the freighter\u2019s boldness was only making things worse. She had a few minutes. Maybe as many as twenty, but after that\u2026", "She could break, try to put as much distance between Brightest Night and the frigate as possible and hope they could survive its missile launches and that God-awful spinal cannon\u2026 but in the end it would run them down.", "They could keep this game of peck-and-poke up and hope to get lucky before a net of pissed-off merchantmen surrounded them like picadors preparing them for the frigate\u2019s killing blow.", "They could surrender, but that even less of an option. Grace and Allyria couldn\u2019t risk being captured. Their fake identities wouldn\u2019t hold up if the Compact ran their DNA. ", "God damn it, this was supposed to be an easy commerce raid! But those were the choice she had now. Die running or die fighting. Grace\u2019s palms were sweating, her mouth was dry and the back of her tunic was soaked in perspiration. She didn\u2019t know what to do. She kept giving orders, each one keeping her ship alive just a little longer, but it was only delaying things.", "More damage reports came in with the latest brief flurry between her ship and the frigate. Systems failures, her screens were on the verge of collapse, the corvette\u2019s hard maneuverers were its already compromised structure. Something was going to give and she was afraid\u2026 ", "Couldn\u2019t fight. Couldn\u2019t run. Couldn\u2019t surrender. Those were the choices she didn\u2019t have.", "Then, with a flash of realization, she saw another one. The Attatan Khin had overshot their target again. It was currently on the other side of Heavy 943, headed away from the freighter and Brightest Night, but it would flip and burn any second now to make another pass and hammer the corvette again, killing her ship by another degree. Its helm crew were good. They always brought their ship in almost dangerously close to the freighter, popping up or around it at the last possible second, reducing the blind zone Brightest Night had and preventing them from firing at it on its approach.", "I can see it, Grace thought. I can see you. I can see how to win.", "Overseer Tavanis poured Grace a glass of something sweet-smelling and she took a drink. As soon as Brightest Night had docked, she\u2019d been summoned to his office. The overseer unsettled her. Until she\u2019d come to the Grasp, she\u2019d never met a Yengesae before and the surgical modifications he\u2019d gone through in an attempt to look more human only seemed to underscore that he wasn\u2019t human. His face and expressions were a little too much like a badly-rendered video game character, he moved in a way that wasn\u2019t human and sometimes she could see the outline of a very alien physique under his loose robes. He was like someone pretending to be human based on a very incomplete knowledge of how humans actually behaved.", "Which, Grace knew, actually described the Overseer perfectly.", "\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d she said. She\u2019d forwarded her report as soon as Brightest Night had entered Jan-xhai, but this was more informal than the debriefing she\u2019d been expected, though she hadn\u2019t really known what to expect. Brightest Night\u2019s command crew were all dead. She\u2019d managed to complete the mission. She wasn\u2019t sure what she could add that wasn\u2019t in her report, but so far Tavanis seemed satisfied with her answers.", "The Yengesae chuckled, a clicking and burring sound that caught her attention. Grace wasn\u2019t sure what she had said that was so funny, then caught herself. \u201cPatron,\u201d she corrected.", "Tavanis filled his own cup, but from a different pitcher. His drink was a reddish black and a few parts per thousand from having the consistency of sludge. \u201cOur Majesty uses the archaic human terms too, sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are a student of history, then.\u201d It was a statement, not an invitation and he didn\u2019t wait for a response before he continued. \u201cYou did well,\u201d the overseer said. \u201cWe lost one ship, but an Attatan Khin-class frigate was destroyed. Seven transports were taken, four scuttled.\u201d His eyes, cosmetically altered to resemble those of a human, met Grace\u2019s. \u201cOne shot down.\u201d", "The Yengesae overseer set his glass down on the table. \u201cFew enough of our leaders could have accomplished the same feat. An even smaller number of officers of your station could have done it. Another commander and crew probably would have died, but you did not. You should be proud. I\u2019m told your companion acquitted herself admirably as well. Please convey my personal gratitude and esteem to her and your crew.\u201d", "Grace took another sip, shifting in her chair. \u201cYes, patron. I will.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019ve begun processing the prisoners,\u201d Tavanis informed Grace. \u201cBetween your cut of the ransoms and the prize money from the rest of this mission, you\u2019ve earned a nice egg to rest on.\u201d The senior officers and most skilled crew from the ships Disturbed Hive took had been transferred onto the freighter Grace had brought to the Grasp. Kryzonim Nonterrestrial Extractions would be notified and an appropriate ransom paid for their return. Junior officers, tradesmen and unimportant ratings had been sent on their way via escape pods and shuttles. Most corporations would, despite some tooth-grinding, pay for the return of their personnel. At the most basic level, no company wanted the public relations disaster of leaving their people in the hands of pirates.", "It was rare for any cartel to take just anyone from the ships they hijacked. An experienced engineer or skilled ship leader were valuable commodities. A cook, junior officer or minor rating was less so and resulted in correspondingly smaller ransoms. It was often not worth the cost and effort of housing them until the company paid up. Some clans would simple kill such \u2018worthless\u2019 people out of hand. Despite its bloody reputation, the Red Hand, like many other cartels, would simply leave them behind. The organization was ruthless, not psychopathic. There was pragmatism there, too: a crew that knew they\u2019d been killed out of hand would fight to the bitter end, making any raid more difficult. And it was simply good business.", "The ships themselves were another valuable commodity. Seven shock-capable heavy transports were not an insignificant investment, even for a corporation like KNE. Ransoming them back was one option, though the Red Hand could also keep them for their own needs, break them down as spare parts to service the rest of their fleet, or even sell them to other cartels. The cargo would not be returned, though. By now, the other six transports, escorted by Disturbed Hive and Skincutter, were on their way to Onza Cr\u00e8che where their stores would be offloaded and the ships\u2019 final fate decided.", "Grace tipped her head. \u201cThank you, patron.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve already received an estimate from our dockworkers. Brightest Night will be laid up for several weeks as the damage from the,\u201d another brief burst of clicking and buzzing, \u201cmeteor storm is repaired. We\u2019ll be trying to find a replacement command crew, but until we do, I see no issue with allowing you to remain as brevet leader of the vessel.\u201d He raised a finger that was just a little too long to be human. \u201cThis is likely to be temporary. You acquitted yourself admirably in Kelkon, but we do have something of a chain of command.\u201d", "\u201cI understand. I appreciate the opportunity.\u201d", "\u201cOne last note. I and my staff concur with your report\u2019s assessment. This was no mere coincidence, but a bait trail laid across our path and an investigation has begun. Our contact in KNE will have to explain themselves\u201d", "Grace\u2019s mouth was dry. It didn\u2019t take any special insight to know what would happen of the agent\u2019s explanation came up short. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that they were misled,\u201d she said. \u201cThey could have been fed false information.\u201d", "\u201cThat is one possibility,\u201d Tavanis acknowledged. \u201cStill, we shall be parting ways from an obviously compromised source. If this was done with foreknowledge, our response will take that into account. That is something you need not worry about. I merely wanted to let you know we will not be letting this pass.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, patron. Thank you.\u201d", "Tavanis stood. \u201cYou did well,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI admit, I was uncertain about Her Majesty\u2019s decisions to take to hatchlings so readily, but you have proven her faith true. If you continue to walk the trail you are on, I see a promising career. The Red Hand can use someone of your potential. The war continues, and the fire rises.\u201d", "Grace nodded and rose to her feet in kind. \u201cIt does, patron. Thank you again. I\u2019ll pass your words to the crew.\u201d She saluted and took her leave, though the overseer\u2019s last words wouldn\u2019t leave her. The fire rises.", "Nobody comes out unburnt, she thought as the doors closed behind her.", "~", "Ransha hummed a half-remembered tune from his childhood as he washed his hands in the precinct\u2019s bathroom.

Now, he and Zirric\u00e9 were both back on patrol duties in the ship hangars, assisting the dockmasters with the collection and levying of fees, honourariums and tributes. His pocket had been doing much better the last couple weeks, as had his bank accounts. Zirric\u00e9 had been spending all his extra cash on recreation, but Ransha had higher aspirations than being a low-level enforcer for his entire career.", "It was hard for members of the client species to climb to positions of authority, but on the Grasp things were a little more fluid, especially for people with ambition and drive, traits that ke Ovik liked to think he possessed. He had his eye on greater things than shaking down quartermasters and keeping the peace as a beat officer. One day he\u2019d be the one with a nice office and a troop of underlings, giving the orders and resting easy. One day.", "The door to the bathroom opened and one of Ransha\u2019s colleagues walked in. Nemem Polus, a Pedlar. Senior to Ransha, Polus was a jovial sort, quick to smile and make a joke. He\u2019d once worked for the police in Natuos and liked to remind others of that fact. He, however, did not like to be reminded why the only employment he could find after taking early retirement from Natuos was on the Grasp. Despite his smiles and seeming good nature, the Pedlar never forgot a slight. His people seemed to be like that. Vanig certainly was. Still, Ransha was on good terms with Nemem. He\u2019d done him a favour once and because of that, Polus considered ke Ovik a friend.", "If he only knew that I kept a few records of my own\u2026 Ransha thought as he nodded in greeting.", "\u201cLong day,\u201d the Pedlar grunted as he stood at the sink next to the Verrish.", "\u201cThey usually are,\u201d Ransha agreed, putting his hands under the dryers.

Ransha had also heard a few stories regarding Nenem\u2019s predilections, how they related to his former partner from Natuos and her disappearance. After the mess he\u2019d helped Nenem clean up, he didn\u2019t doubt the truth of those rumours.", "Nenem chuckled. It was a guttural clucking grunt. \u201cRight, I\u2019ve got the smell of it. You\u2019ve got a taste of your own. I heard you and she got a little heated, though. Couple days later, she stormed off the station.\u201d The Pedlar made a low hooting whistle. \u201cMust have really shat in that nest, hey? Well,\u201d he said, facing Ransha with a grotesque impression of a smile on his thick lips, \u201cmaybe you can fix that.\u201d", "\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Ransha replied.

If Brightest Night pulled away from the freighter, the frigate would pounce on them the instant it came around.", "Grace nodded, but she didn\u2019t look at Allyria. \u201cHelm,\u201d she ordered, her voice hoarse. \u201cCut thrust. Turn our broadside to Heavy 943.\u201d The crew obliged and Brightest Night stopped accelerating and turned on its axis. No longer under power, it was on a ballistic course away from the freighter. Laser fire bracketed the smaller ship as the transport\u2019s gunners acclimated to the change in maneuver, but without any acceleration, the corvette was a sitting duck. It was only a few seconds before the hits started to land. Her helmsman looked over his shoulder at her. A few other officers did so, wondering if she were about to strike their screens and surrender. \u201cTactical,\u201d Grace said. \u201cReady all weapons for rapid-fire. Override safety protocols and give me a combat roll on my mark. Missiles to sprint-mode, be ready to flush the magazines on my mark. Delayed activation.\u201d She paused, briefly closing her eyes. \u201cTarget Heavy 943\u2019s reactor.\u201d", "There was a brief pause, but not one of hesitation. Allyria was making the adjustments. The Verrish made a soft purr. Her tintas shivered briefly, then stilled. \u201cWeapons ready.\u201d", "Alarms started to get more urgent as Heavy 943 started to pound the drifting corvette in earnest. Even the freighter\u2019s armaments could kill Brightest Night if the insurgent ship didn\u2019t respond. Behind Heavy 943, the frigate sensed victory and accelerated, ready to put a mass round though Brightest Night. If Grace failed, that was exactly what would happen. The frigate was getting closer. In moments it would come around.  Heavy 943 and kill them.", "\u201cScreen failure imminent,\u201d Operations reported. \u201cWe can\u2019t take much more, matron.\u201d", "\u201cWait,\u201d Grace ordered. The Attatan Khin wasn\u2019t close enough yet. If it saw, if it guessed\u2026 Wait, she told herself. \u201cWait\u2026\u201d she repeated. Her ship was about to die, but she wasn\u2019t ready. Not yet.", "Closer... Closer.... the numbers on the plot changed.", "Closer.", "More alarms. The freighter was starting to turn to give the frigate a clear line of fire.", "Now.", "\u201cDeploy missiles,\u201d she ordered, watching the display. \u201cWeapons free.\u201d", "Brightest Night fired everything it had, mass rounds, energy batteries and turrets targeting Kryzonim Heavy 943. The freighter\u2019s screens flared, a dozen brilliant loci marking where each beam fell and railgun shot annihilated itself against them. Energy arced and crackled across the freighter\u2019s screens, plasma streams skittering across their periphery. Brighter. Brighter. More fire rained down on Heavy 943 and six seconds after Brightest Night started shooting in earnest, the freighter\u2019s screens collapsed.", "The guns fell silent. For an instant, the order to cease fire lunged to the tip of Grace\u2019s mouth, but she clamped her jaw shut as if she was physically holding the words back. Then, Brightest Night opened up again, its weapons targeting the freighter\u2019s aft section and the engineering hub within it. Railfire smashed against hullplates, the rounds turned into plasma, incinerating everything in their path before their energy was spent. Beams pulsed fiercely, visible where they pass through the molecular cloud hemorrhaging from the freighter, slicing into its vitals. The fire carved through armour, hull and bulkheads, cutting deeper with every passing instant. Alarms screamed on the freighter\u2019s bridge as the ship was peeled open. They knew what was going to happen. There was just enough time for them to realize what Allyria was doing before her assault breached the main reactor chamber. ", "Whether Allyria had hit the reactor itself, or one of the fuel storage pods, Grace didn\u2019t know. Kryzonim Heavy 943 ignited. In an instant, three kilometers of starship was gone, turned into a pulse of radiation, stripped atoms and molten debris scarcely larger than a thimble. There were no shockwaves in space, but the energy burst from the destroyed ship lashed the corvette. Its own screens failed and dozens of pieces of Heavy 943, accelerated to c-fractional velocities, spattered against and penetrated its hull like miniature railgun rounds. More alarms. More casualties. More people who\u2019d died because of Grace\u2019s decisions.", "She shoved all that aside. \u201cTactical,\u201d she said. \u201cDo we have a target?\u201d", "The enemy frigate had been closer to Heavy 943 than Brightest Night was. It hadn\u2019t known what was coming until it was too late and its desperate attempt to claw away from the makeshift bomb had put its heavy railcannon away from the helpless corvette. It was blind, disoriented. Vulnerable.", "\u201cTarget locked,\u201d Allyria said with a predatory hiss. Her lips were pulled back from her teeth in predatory enjoyment.", "\u201cIgnite the missile drives. All batteries to rapid-fire. Keep firing. No matter what, keep firing.\u201d", "The corvette opened up with everything it had left to it, launching missiles as fast it could load them, ignoring safety protocols, firing so fast that its own tubes had no chance to cool down, that launch systems deformed and failed. Three tubes jammed. Railguns failed. Laser cannons overheated. Brightest Night was crippling itself, but it was raining everything it had down on the Compact warship while they could. This was the only chance.", "The Attatan Khin\u2019s screens failed, several missiles striking the frigate. It twisted away from the barrage, belching air and atomized hull. Its starboard weaponry was shredded, that entire flank pocked with craters and molten, deformed hull plates. It came about hard, accelerating away from the Red Hand corvette. Its screens were still down. The wake of its drive was throwing off targeting, but not enough.", "Grace was silent for a moment. \u201cAny there any messages from the enemy warship?\u201d", "Communications checked. \u201cNo, matron.\u201d", "Grace nodded. She was silent for several seconds. The frigate was getting away. If it got its screens back, it could still kill Brightest Night. The corvette wouldn\u2019t have anything left to defend itself. This is your only chance, she told herself. \u201cHelm,\u201d she said softly, her eyes glued to the main viewscreen. \u201cPursue. Tactical\u2026 kill that ship.\u201d", "Grace braced her hands against the wall. Her fingers curled into claws and her knuckles whitened as she made fists. She stared at the droplets on the ceramic tiles, seeing in them the glare of missile drives as they homed in on the helpless frigate. Closer, closer, closer\u2026 There\u2019d been another flash of light. This one softer and longer as a starship burned. She wiped the tiles with one hand, but she could still see it and she started to claw at the wall, trying to erase the image but it stayed with her, burned into her brain. Grace started beat her hands against the wall. No. No. No. NO!", "She screamed as she pounded her fists against the tiles harder and harder. Ceramic broke. Bursts of pain blossomed in her hands, spiking through her fingers. Her own blood started to mingle with the water draining beneath her and she was still screaming, still smashing her torn, broken hands against the wall until someone grabbed her and pulled her away. She kicked and struggled, howling and sobbing until Allyria\u2019s voice registered.", "\u201cGrace,\u201d the Verrisha said, holding the smaller woman tightly, sagging down in the stall. Water was still pouring on them both. \u201cOh, Grace. Your hands\u2026 What happened? What did you do?\u201d", "The blonde couldn\u2019t look at her lover, staring at the damage she\u2019d done to the wall, at the cracks spiderwebbed across it. Broken, jagged bits of tile stuck out in place, speckled with blood. Her hands were cut and several of her fingers felt like they were fractured. \u201cI did it,\u201d she said. Her vision was blurred from tears. \u201cI did it. In Kelkon. I saw. I saw. I saw and I killed them. I killed a transport that thought they were fighting pirates. I killed a ship that might have been trying to surrender.\u201d", "\u201cYou didn\u2019t destroy them until they tried to kill us,\u201d Allyria said. \u201cAnd that frigate would have pulled back, waited for its screens to regenerate and then come after us again. You did what you had to do.\u201d", "\u201cIts comm array was gone,\u201d Grace said. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t tell us it was over. Its screens were already down. It couldn\u2019t strike them to show us it had stopped fighting. It was running. I might have killed a ship that wanted to surrender.\u201d Weakly: \u201cI saw how to win, Allyria. It was just an instant, but I saw. I used Heavy 943 as a bomb. I did what she would have done.\u201d She looked at her hands now. They were shaking, water and blood mixing and running down her arms, dripping from her fingers. Pain throbbed from her hands, up her arms. \u201cI won.\u201d", "Allyria kissed the top of Grace\u2019s head. \u201cYou did. You won. They were the enemy. They tried to kill us and they paid for it. We won. That\u2019s what counts.\u201d", "Grace shook her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she said adamantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not. That\u2019s how they think. I don\u2019t want to be like that.\u201d She looked away. \u201cNot like anyone who doesn\u2019t care about the cost. Not like Usul. Not like the Compact. Not like you.\u201d", "The instant the words were out of her mouth, she wanted to take them back, but she couldn\u2019t. It was too late.", "There was silence in the bathroom except for the sound of falling water."]}

The door wasn\u2019t capable of slamming, but it somehow it seemed to close much louder as Allyria had stormed out of the room. She hadn\u2019t even looked back at Grace, her last words to her telling her to get someone to look at her hands.", "Sitting on the edge of the bath, wet and naked with blood still dripping from her lacerated fingers, Grace cried. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said to the empty apartment. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it\u2026 not like that.\u201d", "She looked down at her hands and the pooled mixture of water and blood on the floor. \u201cNot like that...\u201d", "~", "Axex Vanig was in a good mood tonight. The Velvet Purse was doing brisk business. He\u2019d brought in a new troupe of entertainers which in turn had brought in a lot of regulars and new customers. The demand for fresh faces was constant. The life tended to use up most of his talent, one way or another. Some managed to buy out their contracts and pay back the money invested in them, going on to do whatever with the rest of their lives. Others did not. It was a shame, but hardly his fault if some of his employees were too stupid to fully understand what they signed up for, or just weren\u2019t able to handle it. They signed the contract \u2013 swallowed the token, to use the old language \u2013 and whatever came next was on them. It wasn\u2019t his problem.", "It wasn\u2019t like he personally or his recruiters were out there with nets, throwing citizens into cages and hauling them off like barbarians. Some people wanted off their world and out of their lives and were willing to do whatever it took to get that. Others simply got more than expected out of a new career. No, he was a civilized being. He was an entrepreneur and a businessman at the center of dozens of enterprises and some of those required certain things from their employees. That was how the world worked. There was a need and he filled it. Anyone that said or believed otherwise was fooling themselves. If it wasn\u2019t him, than someone else would be in this position, so why shouldn\u2019t he make a little money away from the moralizing of the \u2018law-abiding\u2019 cattle and the self-righteous sneers of the authorities. As if there\u2019d never been a Compact ship taking leave, an investigator enjoying a meal, or an official stopping in for an evening\u2019s entertainment here. Hypocrites.", "The Pedlar scowled, his pleasant mood starting to dissipate as he rubbed one heavy thumb over his right palm. The wound was completely healed, but just thinking about the incident made his hand ache. \u2018Slavery\u2019, he thought vehemently, remembering the scorn in the human\u2019s piping voice. It\u2019s business, which you\u2019d know if you spent any time at all on it instead of chasing the Compact\u2019s swinging cock.", "Vanig had seen would-be revolutionaries before. There were even a few passels of them littering the station as they sought to recruit other idiots, make offers of alliance, or ask boons from established clans. More had come since the Red Hand had moved in, expecting a favourable reception or even preferential treatment from the Red Queen and her misbegotten striplings. Parasite flies buzzing around the body of a barren sow.", "He shook his large head as if to dislodge the morose thoughts that had overcome him and lifted himself up from his desk, standing as straight as his species\u2019s physiology allowed. He would tour the club. To see his happy customers paying and his compliant employees earning always improved his mood. His bodyguards, waiting outside the door to his office, fell in behind him as the Pedlar headed towards the elevator, but he didn\u2019t make it halfway there before Cilitii commed him. The high-pitched chittering and rapid speech of his Didact aide always grated on Vanig\u2019s nerves, but he found her to be an effective administrative assistant. \u201cSorry to disturb you, kih. There is someone here to see you.\u201d", "\u201cYes, who is it?\u201d He didn\u2019t have anyone on his schedule today, so that meant it was an unannounced supplicant. Well, they could wait until he-", "\u201cIt\u2019s station security, kih. Officer ke Ovik. He says it\u2019s quite urgent.\u201d There was a slight tremor in Cilitii\u2019s voice. As a younger man, Axex had studied evolutionary psychology and how it influenced interspecies relations. It always seemed to him that there was still a bit of their primordial prey heritage in Didacts. Brutes had evolved hunting things like Cilitii\u2019s ancestors and perhaps there was still of that atavistic wariness in his Didact aide. Or she simply didn\u2019t like the security proctor.", "\u201cHrrrm,\u201d Vanig grunted. \u201cSend him up.\u201d It was just over two months since the Brute had made contact with him and Vanig was wondering if the investment was worth it. Oh, ke Ovik had passed along several interesting tidbits of information, but Axex could have gotten them through his other contacts in Grasp Security. What he wanted from ke Ovik was what the creature had promised and so far had not delivered.", "Staring down into the main floor, Axex looked over the milling crowds. There really were a lot of people in the club tonight. Even the Brute proctor was having a hard time making his way through the crowd. Heavyset bouncers from different species kept a close eye on the goings-on, ensuring that clients didn\u2019t get too rough with the entertainers \u2013 at least, not without paying first.", "Business was business, after all.", "Soon enough, the Brute had reached the elevator and ascended to the upper levels. Vanig didn\u2019t turn to acknowledge him. He was still watching the crowds below and he waited for the younger man to speak. What passed for a smirk formed on the security officer\u2019s face and he remained silent. An annoyed sneer tugged at Vanig\u2019s heavy lips. \u201cWhat do you have?\u201d he finally asked, his irritation rising.", "Ke Ovik carefully removed a flimsi from his pocket. Vanig\u2019s Worker bodyguard took it from him and passed it to the crime boss. There was a video on it, taken from one of the station\u2019s many security cameras. The subject appeared to be another Brute, a female this time. It looked vaguely familiar. \u201cWhat am I looking at?\u201d he said, beginning to wonder if this was a waste of his time.", "\u201cOne of the Red Queen\u2019s newest pets,\u201d ke Ovik replied.", "Vanig blinked his small dark eyes, looking again at the video. It had been taken less than an hour ago from outside the Red Hand\u2019s spire. As he stared, he realized that ke Ovik was correct; the female Brute was one of the crew that the Red Queen had personally welcomed to the station just over two months ago. This time, the animal was without her companion or any other escort. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me why this should interest me.\u201d", "The proctor\u2019s lips pulled back from his teeth in what Vanig recognized as a widening smile. \u201cTake a look at her outfit.\u201d", "Axex was losing patience, but he played along. He watched the feed a second time. The Brute woman was wearing a pair of dark trousers and a light grey shirt that looked wet. She had a knife \u2013 long enough to be a gladius to other species \u2013 strapped low on her hip, but was otherwise unarmed. He didn\u2019t see what\u2026", "\u2026wait.", "He reviewed the video yet again and then a fourth time to confirm his observation. Finally, the Pedlar lifted his large head and his own lips drew back in a grin. The Brute woman, one of the Red Queen\u2019s new favourites, wasn\u2019t wearing the Red Hand\u2019s sigil or any other indication of her affiliation with the clan. True, such displays could be subtle so as not to give outside interests a reason to declare that criminals were operating openly on the station \u2013 the Red Hand\u2019s preferred insignia for use here were not actually their organization\u2019s symbol, but a vine that was green at the base and turned crimson. Vanig didn\u2019t know nor care about the symbology behind it. Bolder members of a clan might have tattoos to blatantly state their allegiance. Others might wear a particular piece of clothing or jewelry other equally minor indicators. Vanig was very familiar with the different ways the major, and most of the minor, syndicates on the Grasp advertised their allegiance. The Brute had none of them. The Pedlar\u2019s mind was running and he dimly became aware that ke Ovik was speaking again. Vanig twitched one ear to listen.", "\u201cThe individual in this video, Kyriel se Veni, is a person of interest to Grasp Security,\u201d ke Ovik said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hoping to question her, but due to certain political issues, we don\u2019t have enough of a case to warrant bringing her in. Of course, if there was to be an official complaint filed by an upstanding and respected member of the community, we could take action.\u201d", "Vanig ran the clip a final time and paused to gather his thoughts for a moment. \u201cIt occurs to me,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cThat I believe I may be able to help with your investigation, officer ke Ovik. There was an incident at the club recently. My staff were harassed and one of them was assaulted by an individual that matches se Veni\u2019s description. I would like to file a report with Grasp Security. If possible, I would also like a chance to speak with the person responsible and\u2026 remonstrate them for their actions. Provided that, of course, does not impinge on the duties or needs of Grasp Security.\u201d", "\u201cNot at all,\u201d ke Ovik replied. \u201cWe are here to serve our citizens, after all.\u201d He showed his teeth. \u201cAnd we delight in resolving difficult situations.\u201d", "~", "\u201cFrom this close, it\u2019s hard to see it,\u201d Ukask mused, Light of Judgement\u2019s sigil leader taking a drink from his glass.", "\u201cSee what?\u201d Yunl\u2019ro inquired. They were in her quarters. It was becoming a tradition that she would have her sigil vessel\u2019s commander for dinner to close out the week. Sometimes their discussions would be strictly business, other times it was more of a social meeting. Her people had something of a reputation for introversion that could be interpreted as standoffishness. While the Bastion Leader did indeed often prefer solitude, she had learned to make personal connections with her peers and subordinates. Morale was as vital to any operation as ships and weaponry and a crew\u2019s faith in their leader could be the difference between life and death. On this mission, perhaps more so than ever.", "Still, she was grateful for the diplomatically-inclined Ukask. He was able to smooth over the rough edges that his superior occasionally left in her wake and, like on Rally, deal with the more petty and niggling issues that she had no inclination to waste time with. He was something of a social chameleon, gregarious and outgoing when called for, but also willing to accept introspective silences from his superior without finding the need to fill them with inane chatter.", "Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s steward appeared just long enough to clear the last dishes from the table, removing the tablecloth and placing a clean on in its stead. Yunl\u2019ro gave him a grateful nod before he departed.", "\u201cThe Black Veil,\u201d Ukask replied. He gestured to the windows. The execution force had passed through the massive molecular cloud that gave the Black Veil its name and now multi-hued lights of orange, yellow, red and green filtered in, all the colours of a young, productive emission nebula. To the Principality, the nebula was known as the Radiant Streams \u2013 a reference to the cords of stellar material that extended across dozens of light-years, like rivers in space.", "\u201cFrom outside, it is this brooding, sinister thing that dominates the sky for light-years around, but once you get close enough, it reveals itself to be something completely different.\u201d", "Nebulae were impressive at a distance; up close, they often had only a few additional parts per thousand of particulate matter. Over a span of light-years, that added up, creating displays of colour and clouds that had awed and inspired countless individuals across hundreds of worlds. To someone inside the nebula itself, space appeared much the same. \u2018Like being in the eye of a hurricane of colour,\u2019 Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s mentor had often said. \u2018Wherever you are is normal, but all around you is something very different.\u2019 The old bastard had loved flowery, imprecise language, more than was seemly for a Thoughtful. Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro had already entered that \u2018eye\u2019, not that the nebula was wholly clear. They were on the outskirts now, but deeper inside lay denser clouds of gas and dust, gravitational eddies and the smouldering pillars of creation and Bok globules where stars were born. The further in the fleet ventured, the more difficult their mission would be. In due time, they would find star systems choked with stardust, swirling manses of proto-planetary matter and superheated gases.", "Yunl\u2019ro had already sent a missive to Local Command at Galhemna and an additional courier to Force Command requesting more light scouting units. Her losses so far were minor, but she expected them to mount as the fleet pressed inward, particularly if their target had led further traps. \u201cThe nebula changes in our perspective because of its nature,\u201d she replied. \u201cThe aggregation of particulate matter creates the appearance of dense space, but its nature is unchanged.\u201d", "Ukask clucked his tongue. The Bastion Leader was not fond of allegory or metaphor. \u201cTrue,\u201d he agreed. He let a moment pass in silence before he voiced the question that had been running, unspoken, whispered or wondered aloud, through the entire fleet. \u201cWhat do you suppose we\u2019ll find?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro answered simply. Other than the first minefield, her scouts had encountered no further trace of their enemy. Several times, small vessels had been detected around the periphery of the advancing squadrons, but they disengaged when challenged and were believed to be either Red Hand scouts, or Unbound in service to that faction. None of these contacts had been reported beyond the outermost systems.", "There was also dissension amongst the strategists as to whether or not the \u2018Splinter\u2019 vessel belonged to their quarry, its hull type completely different from their target and the Scar that ambushed Pradesh. Some argued that it was a new design, others that it was a repurposed vessel from an unknown civilization. A far-ranging patrol had even reported faint radio signals from beyond the nebula that might indicate a starfaring nation. One theory even supposed that this polity might be aiding their target.", "The closer they got and the more they discovered, the more questions arose. The simplest one was: where to go next? There was no indication of their destination and each star system needed to be checked. Not an inconsiderable task in and of itself. Additional fabricator ships would become necessary to build and maintain picket and augur platforms and keep the fleet supplies. More scouts to scour the nebula and patrol the systems they passed by, more heavy vessels to reinforce the vanguards and ensure the main fleet\u2019s strength was not squandered or diluted. Quite simply, Yunl\u2019ro needed more. But she also needed something to show for it. Two unclassifieds, regardless of their providence, might not be convincing enough on their own. Not with so many assets dedicated to liberating Jackal-held worlds and Sundial\u2019s own needs.", "\u201cI don\u2019t believe we can count ourselves so lucky as to simply fall over our quarry\u2019s womb,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt will be deep in the nebula.\u201d She felt a flicker of disquiet. By rights, the machine\u2019s defences should all be farther inside the Black Veil, but the Splinter and its minefields had revealed that there was something worth defending. Perhaps they were newly established and the machine had intended to press outwards to supplement the Red Hand\u2019s own operations. Another coincidence of intent there.", "\u201cTwo thousand years,\u201d Ukask replied. \u201cAttacking us every moment it can, disappearing for centuries. Ever since I leaned of it, I was always curious\u2026\u201d he trailed off, still looking out the window.", "\u201cCurious about what?\u201d", "\u201cWhat it was doing,\u201d the Tribune said, taking a deep drink from his glass. \u201cWhen it disappeared. I\u2019ve wondered where it\u2019s gone. What it\u2019s seen.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro was quiet herself for a moment. There was no question that the Wound had travelled farther than almost any other ship known to the Compact. What it had done on its long recuperations was still the topic of much discussion. The most recent example was of its corruption of the Brutes, but there were other things that hinted at other agendas, traps and schemes it had played across the centuries that seemed to have little or nothing to do with its vendetta. The poisoning of the fields of Triaxen. Its presence on Delacore. The Starbreak of Jhiimin. Some said these were simply symptoms of rampancy and insanity, the machine not truly knowing or caring what it was doing. Others thought that these actions were part of some intricate levers-and-pulleys strategy and still others\u2026 like Ukask, they wondered what the abomination had witnessed in its millennia of life and what else it might be planning or capable of.", "The Thoughtful wasn\u2019t sure. Truth be told, she liked none of those explanations.  \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted at last. \u201cBut I think we shall find out.\u201d", "\u201cHrrm,\u201d Ukask grunted. \u201cTrue.\u201d He raised his glass to the nebula outside. \u201cMarvelous and wondrous things, I think we shall see.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro blinked, then tilted her head. Some might consider the sigil leader\u2019s words inappropriate, bordering on heresy, but she recognized them. It was a saying that dated back centuries, before Tribunes encountered the Compact. In their dominant society, the words \u2018marvelous\u2019 and \u2018wondrous\u2019 had etymological roots in terms for magic and witchcraft, something that many Tribune cultures held in mistrust, if not antipathy. Marvels and wonders, by their very name, were to be viewed with suspicion and concern. Though other species did not have the same outlook on the marvelous and wondrous, the saying persisted amongst the Tribune population. \u201cI think we might,\u201d she agreed.", "\u201cSo then,\u201d Ukask chuckled to lighten the mood. \u201cThe sword of the Compact drives ever onwards, as it always must.\u201d He raised his glass to his superior. \u201cFor what good is a blade that is sheathed?\u201d", "The Thoughtful lifted her own cup. \u201cNone at all.\u201d", "\u201cTo the mission, then.\u201d", "\u201cThe mission.\u201d", "\u201cTo finding the enchanter of what marvels we may see\u2026 and cutting the throat of it and its sibling.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Yul\u2019ro agreed. \u201cTo that as well.\u201d", "~", "\u201cDo you believe this is a good idea?\u201d", "Vanig blinked in surprise. His bodyguard Sevras that had spoken, interrupting his gleeful reverie. Since the Red Queen\u2019s visit, Axex had soured on having the large Tribune as one of his security detail and over the last two months, he had tried to find a replacement, but the day before taking the position, the first man broke his leg in an \u2018accident\u2019. The second suddenly decided to leave the station for a job elsewhere. Shortly thereafter, a politely-worded communiqu\u00e9 had come in from Axex\u2019s contacts within the Blotted Suns, reminding him that Sevras was \u2018very highly recommended\u2019 and they liked to see their associates given the very best and was he absolutely sure that he wished to dispense with the services of such a competent and capable guard? There hadn\u2019t been a hint of threat, but the message was clear. Sevras was staying.", "\u201cYes,\u201d he snapped testily. \u201cI do.\u201d ke Ovik was off searching the station\u2019s security feeds for the Brute female\u2019s current location. Once they found her, he and his partner would collect her and bring her to Vanig to be identified as a troublemaker. He had several of his employees already prepared to testify appropriately in the matter. There would then be some \u2018questioning\u2019 on the premises, after which she\u2019d be taken into GSF custody. The security officer seemed to have his own intentions for the woman, but that wasn\u2019t Vanig\u2019s plan. Se Veni, or whatever her name might actually be, was not going to walk out of the Velvet Purse.", "\u201cse Veni is a member of the Red Hand,\u201d Sevras pointed out bluntly.", "\u201cWe have no information on that,\u201d Vanig corrected him. \u201cShe\u2019s not wearing anything that identifies her as one of them. She may have renounced her allegiance or been set aside.\u201d It was a thin fiction, but between that and Grasp Security\u2019s \u2018official\u2019 interest in the woman, Vanig believed he was covered. The Grasp could be a dangerous place and if someone ran afoul of law enforcement in the course of their duties, well things happened.", "The Pedlar rubbed his thumb over his palm. He\u2019d been humiliated in his place of business, his own house by a whimpering scrap of meat. A Broken who\u2019d somehow kludged together psychopaths and zealots and thought she was the equal of her betters. Who\u2019d had the temerity to enforce her morality on him. He wouldn\u2019t let that pass. He\u2019d been waiting months for this opportunity and now he had all the justification he needed. The Red Hand\u2019s queen was gone, back off on her idiot crusade and that simpering milklick Tavanis wouldn\u2019t start a clan war over one newcomer. The arrogant kahveh might wheedle and snarl, but between their own agent\u2019s stupidity and the GSF\u2019s official interest, they\u2019d have no room to maneuver.", "The Tribune blinked his nocturnal eyes, his blind larger, lower eyes staring at his employer. \u201cYou are committed to this action?\u201d", "His patience gone, Vanig rapped his fingers on his desk, swivelling in his chair to face his underling. \u201cI am. I am also tired of being questioned by subordinates. Is that understood?\u201d", "Sevras tipped his head in a gesture of submission. \u201cYes, kih. I understand.\u201d", "A few moments later, ke Ovik returned. \u201cI\u2019ve located the suspect,\u201d he informed Vanig.", "The Pedlar leaned forward. \u201cExcellent.

This was his day, his moment. The Red Hand\u2019s bitch-queen had hurt him and he was going to return the favour. One of her toys was going to get broken.", "He saw that realization in the Brute\u2019s eyes and knew that whatever ke Ovik had had in mind was now spiralling into the drain. The Brute was silent for a moment. His head-tails twitched, their tips flicking back and forth as he weighed his options, but he acquiesced. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to pick up my partner first, so we had better leave now.\u201d", "Vanig bobbed his head. \u201cMy team will meet you at the club\u2019s doors.\u201d He grinned, exposing a mouth full of large teeth. \u201cThank you for your service, officer. It is always a pleasure to liaise with law enforcement to ensure the safe, secure running of the station.\u201d", "Ke Ovik said nothing further as the door closed behind him. Vanig leaned back in his chair, a smile on his face. He rubbed his thumb over his palm again.", "It didn\u2019t ache any longer.", "~", "There were relatively few things in the galaxy that would part crowds easier than an angry Verrish, and few of those happened to be on the Grasp. Allyria had left the Red Hand\u2019s spire, headed nowhere in particular. She just couldn\u2019t be there right now. Her tintas were writhing like angry snakes and every breath hissed out from between her sharp teeth. Her head was pounding and she had to pause several times to wipe tears out of her eyes.", "She was angry. Angry at Grace for what she\u2019d said, angry at what she\u2019d said, angry at herself for getting so upset, angry at the whole situation, angry at the Compact who\u2019d started everything. The young woman leaned against the wall and covered her face with one hand. How could she say that? How could she say that to me? Like I was one of them!", "Allyria slammed a fist against the wall. The metal rang. She would never apologize for hating the people who\u2019d subjugated her world, had broken an entire generation and were trying their best to erase all Verrish culture and identity to turn her species into good little servants like humans had become. She\u2019d never apologize for fighting them or for killing anyone who served the Compact. It was what they deserved.", "But.", "I\u2019m sorry that it was you, but I\u2019m not sorry that it happened. The words she\u2019d spoken months ago, standing over the body of a dead Tribune came back to her. His name had been Treyr. He\u2019d been the first person she\u2019d killed. There\u2019d been more since as she\u2019d fought to defend Nemesis from the Compact assault. They\u2019d been the enemy and she\u2019d never given more thought to them beyond that.", "But.", "She still remembered Treyr. She\u2019d known there\u2019d be more like him. People she\u2019d have to kill that she didn\u2019t hate. Maybe it was that \u2018lack of interspecies empathy\u2019 the Compact said was particular to Brutes. Maybe it was her, but she\u2019d never lost sleep over that idea.", "I don\u2019t want to be like that. Grace\u2019s admission had cut her. Hurt her, more than almost anything the other girl had ever said before.", "Someone approached, asking if she was all right. Without even looking, she hissed angrily and they scampered away. There were too many people here. Too much noise and sensation and Allyria stalked off, not even really sure where she was headed as long as it was away from everyone else. She didn\u2019t know how long it took her, but she ended up in some empty side passages well below the populated desks and habitat levels. It was darker here, the area assigned a low priority in basic maintenance. There weren\u2019t any giant flashing lights and holographic advertisements and the few public computer terminals here were in power-saving mode. There was no sign of any other living person and Allyria let out a breath, running her hands up into her tintas. Her head-tails twitched and shivered like agitated snakes. She tried to calm herself down, but she was still too worked up.", "The Compact said Verrisha \u2013 Brutes \u2013 were savages, so instinctively violent and aggressive that they were little above blindsighted predators. That they\u2019d eked a civilization together out of trial and error, not true advancement and development. That they were examples of functional minds at work.", "Grace had only seen what the Compact had done to Earth after the fact. She\u2019d had to learn her people\u2019s true history. Allyria had lived it. She\u2019d had confessors, teachers, counsellors and even her own foster parents look her in the eyes and ask if she was sure what she knew, if she wasn\u2019t filtering things through the wrong lens. Like some kind of primitive idiot mistaking an airplane for a giant bird, too stupid and ignorant to know otherwise. Are you sure you saw what you saw?", "\u201cYes,\u201d she growled fiercely. She\u2019d seen the gutted wreckage of cities. She\u2019d lived in the refugee camps. She\u2019d seen airstrikes carried out against \u201cterrorists\u201d, watched garrison forces rolling through what streets were left. She remembered being home alone and hiding in a closet, curled up and rocking back and forth as she heard alien soldiers kick in her neighbour\u2019s door, heard shouting and gunshots, terrified that they were going to come over and take her away, too. And she remembered the day that they did, when her parents had been informed that she\u2019d been selected for the Envoy Children program. She\u2019d seen what the Compact had done to her family, her people, her entire world.", "I don\u2019t want to be like that. Grace\u2019s words still rang in her ears, still cut.", "\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Allyria said to the empty corridor. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to be any other way.\u201d She fell to her knees and bowed her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be like me either.\u201d The things she hadn\u2019t said, but should have, came out in a whisper. \u201cBut they\u2019re the enemy, Grace. I don\u2019t know how to see them as more than that.\u201d Her claws unsheathed. \u201cI want to hurt them. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever want to stop. I don\u2019t know if I know how.\u201d", "Maybe it was the headache, still pounding its way from the ends of her tintas to the inside of her skull. It might have been her own thoughts, the overwhelming melange of anger, doubt and self-recrimination distracting her. It might have been both, but in the end, Allyria didn\u2019t realize she wasn\u2019t alone until she heard the footsteps coming up the corridor.", "\u201cI think she\u2019s having a bad day, hey,\u201d a familiar voice whispered, trying to be quiet.", "\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d another said, making no effort in kind. \u201cPoor girl looks like she could use a friend.\u201d", "There was a rough, high-pitched giggle in response.", "Allyria\u2019s shoulders slumped. It took her a moment before she rose to her feet. Not today. Gods, just not today. She turned to face her visitors. It was ke Ovik and the other Verrish officer, Zirric\u00e9. Further up the corridor, Allyria could sense the presence of several others.", "\u201cHello, friend,\u201d Ransha said, \u201cI told you I\u2019d surprise you.\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d Allyria said, and her heart broke for the second time that day. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d"]}

Her mother said those stories were for older children, which made Allyria cross. She was old enough! She\u2019d pouted until her mother had taken out Allyria\u2019s favourite book and promised to read something from it, just for her.", " \u201cWhich one tonight?\u201d Sallina asked. \u201cMaybe the tale of Kyria and the Wood Spirit? Or the House of Stone? ", "\u201cI\u2019ve heard all those!\u201d the young girl protested. \u201cI want a new one. There\u2019s lots you haven\u2019t told me yet!\u201d ", "Her mother smiled and kissed the top of her head.  \u201cAll right, little one. A new story it is.\u201d She leafed through the book until she reached one of the later chapters. Like the rest of the book, each page was brightly illustrated, with a little bit of text to accompany it.

He was a great warrior and served his king well. He travelled the land, defeating bandits and monsters and all the people knew his name. But he was prideful and believed he could never fail. He said often that there was no one that could beat him with blade or bow. To teach him humility, his king held a great tournament and invited champions from across the land to try their mettle against Venkosa, but none bested him. Venkosa grew prouder and more boastful, saying that there was none in any kingdom that could defeat him.", "\u201cMen and women from all over the world heard of his claims and many came to challenge him, but none ever defeated him. His hubris grew and grew until he claimed that even without his eyes, he would still be the greatest warrior on Vara. Not even the gods themselves could defeat him.\u201d", "She turned the page. There was a picture of the sky splitting asunder and a burning, skeletal Verrish form falling to earth like a meteor. Allyria\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cFor this arrogance, the gods sent an ariashtu. The harbinger appeared before Venkosa and struck him blind. He was told that only when his skill matched his boasts would his sight be restored.", "\u201cVenkosa was no longer the warrior that he once was and nearly gave in to despair,\u201d Sallina turned the next few pages, showing the formerly great hero as a beggar in the streets. \u201cHe wallowed in his self-pity and soon, many began to forget the name Venkosa te Sar, or question whether he had ever been a hero at all.\u201d", "\u201cThen one day, a monster came to bring his kingdom to ruin, a great wyrm. He had defeated a smaller beast before his blinding, but that was a long time ago. Though he could not see, Venkosa could hear the panic of the people around him as they fled. He heard their pleas for help as they were devoured by the wyrm, the sounds of the king\u2019s soldiers falling in hopeless battle and he felt a great despair, for he knew that he had failed them. He had fought for the acclaim it had brought him, for the wealth and prestige, not for the rightness of it and he had allowed his victories to blind him long before the ariashtu took his sight.", "\u201cHe could hear the laughing of the wyrm\u2019s masters,\u201d Sallina pointed to the small, too-thin pale shapes cloistered around the monster, \u201cand he knew this was his greatest test. If he won, he would prove himself the warrior he always said he was. But he was blind and afraid. Yet, he heard the cries of the injured and dying around him and he stood, blade in hand as the monster approached\u2026\u201d Sallina turned the page, but there was nothing after it and she closed the book.", "\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Allyria demanded. \u201cDid he fight?

She was, however, determined to be stuck-up. Their meeting in The Best Spices had only confirmed it to Ransha.", "Such a pity, he thought with a mental sigh. She was a striking young woman, slender and tall with well-defined muscles and sensuously long tintas. Her affections were wasted on that pale little morsel. Ransha wondered how unimpressive the Rally Envees had to be to make se Veni look to some zhenra esh for companionship. If only she\u2019d been on Aprimex, or he on Rally. They would have made quite a pair. They still could have, if not for that attitude of hers.", "Unfortunate all around. Still, he wasn\u2019t about to let an opportunity go to waste.", "The plan, as Ransha saw it, was simple. Get se Veni to Vanig. Get paid. She\u2019d get a little roughed up, fine. After all that, bring her back to the precinct, have a nice sit-down with her and see if she was feeling friendlier. If she wasn\u2019t, well\u2026 he was certain the Compact would be very interested to know how a woman ended up over a thousand light-years from where she\u2019d allegedly died. He knew he was, but he was willing to put that aside if te Neu was willing to be sociable. If not\u2026 well\u2026 finding someone who was supposed to be dead was the kind of thing that got people noticed. Either way, Ransha came out ahead. Te Neu might not, but she was the one who\u2019d leashed herself to the wrong people. She was the one who was determined not to be sociable. So very unfortunate, but it still all broke in Ransha\u2019s favour.", "Back up the corridor, just around a bend in the hall, Vanig\u2019s men waited. He\u2019d told them to hold off.

Despite the low light of the ill-used corridors, he had no problem seeing her, his off-yellow eyes dilating. The woman was wearing the same clothes she\u2019d stormed out of the Red Hand section in: a tight grey sleeveless shirt and dark pants. Her eyes were puffy and purplish. She\u2019d been crying.", "He smiled a little wider, remembering how she\u2019d pinned him to the table and threatened him.

Even if his reactions weren\u2019t slowed by narcotics, Zirric\u00e9 wouldn\u2019t have had a chance. She had her weapon drawn before his pistol cleared its holster.", "The young man made only a surprised gasp as Allyria threw the knife and it went into his throat, the blood-slick blade jutting from the back of his neck. Zirric\u00e9\u2019s eyes widened in surprised pain and sudden, helpless panic. He reached up, his hands wrapping around the knife\u2019s hilt as if he was going to pull it out. He looked at Ransha and opened his mouth as if to ask for help, but he was beyond saving. He couldn\u2019t even form the words as bloody froth bubbled over his lips. He was already dead. His body just had to catch up to that fact. That only took a few seconds and as his bloodless face greyed, Zirric\u00e9 toppled to the deck.", "Ransha froze. The shocking, sudden lethality caught him off-guard, but he shoved his shock down and went for his own weapon. Allyria\u2019s knife was still lodged in Zirric\u00e9\u2019s throat, but she darted for Ransha, rapidly closing the distance between them. The security officer only got the weapon out of its holster before she grabbed his hand, twisting the barrel of his gun down towards the deck. He squeezed the trigger. The shot was unspeakably loud in the corridor, making both of their ears ring. The bullet bounced harmlessly off the deck. He tried to bring the gun back up as he grabbed her other hand, keeping her claws away from his face and throat. He was shouting, spittle flying from his mouth. He didn\u2019t know if he was cursing or telling her to stand down.", "Allyria\u2019s left hand closed over Ransha\u2019s right, pushing the barrel of the gun away from her midsection, bending it up towards his. His muscles tensed as he struggled against her, but she had better leverage and she was overpowering him. Her forefinger was over his. He couldn\u2019t get it out of the trigger guard. His eyes widened. He opened his mouth, managed to form one coherent word. \u201cDon\u2019t-\u201d It was all he had time for.", "Her finger pressed down on his, pushing the trigger back. The gun fired. Again. Again. Four shots. Five. Six. Ransha convulsed each time. His uniform was similar to the clothing provided by the Compact military to its officers and enlisted and provided a modicum of thermal, anti-ballistic and anti-stab protection to its wearer, but at this range it couldn\u2019t do anything. Each shot went into his torso and out his back. His eyes widened. Fire was spreading through his guts and on its heels came a cold, gnawing numbness. He coughed and felt something wet and warm dribble down his chin. The gun fired a seventh and final time, finally clicking empty.", "His legs felt like wet noodles and he slumped in the woman\u2019s grasp. He stared up at Allyria, trying to form words but the breath had been forced out of his body. This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen, he thought. It wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. It wasn\u2019t supposed to happen\u2026 he met her eyes.", "She was crying.", "~", "Allyria watched Ransha die. She felt him sag in her arms, heard the last breath rasp out of his mouth, a trickle of blood running over his lips and along his cheeks. She let go and his body crumpled to the deck, a tangle of limbs and tintas. She was shaking. She didn\u2019t know why. She\u2019d killed Compact soldiers before. But this\u2026 this was different. She\u2019d gotten in fights with other Verrish children, but never wanted to hurt them. Not like this. She\u2019d never killed one of her own people, never wanted to.", "Why. Why. Why couldn\u2019t you have walked away? She wanted to scream the question at him and his partner, even though they couldn\u2019t answer. She felt sick and her stomach churned, as if she were about to vomit.", "She didn\u2019t get the chance.", "Ta-dink dink dink dink\u2026", "A small metal cylinder rolled along the deck.", "Instinctively, Allyria looked over at it. In the low light of the hallway, her eyes were dilated. It took less than a second to realize what it was. Less than that for her to start to turn away. Not nearly enough time.", "There was a flash of brightness and an earsplitting bang and then, darkness.", "~", "Nenkot was sitting in the waiting room outside the supervisor\u2019s office. He\u2019d just gotten off a sixteen hour shift and been told to report directly here. Officially, the shipyard complex was listed as Fourth Galhemna Level Six, the fourth of the system\u2019s leviathan-rated shipwombs.", "It was in deep orbit of Vumot, the system\u2019s third planet. A lifeless rock, Vumot was currently undergoing planetcrack, and would be for decades more as the planet was steadily broken up by massive mining rigs, sifted for valuable materials to be used in the Compact\u2019s industry, the rest left to drift across the former planet\u2019s orbital path.", "Already, the world was gathering a small ring from the dust stirred up by its destruction, and the waste products as mining ships, ore processors and industrial nodes fed, like parasite worms glutting themselves on the body of a grub.", "The view of that rampant industry was largely blocked, though. Fourth Galhemna Level Six was known locally by an unofficial nickname: the Sprawl. The station was the largest of Galhemna\u2019s construction facilities, more than a hundred kilometers across with multiple tiered gantries radiating out from its massive central spoke and branching off secondary nodes, each of them as large as a station in their own right. The Sprawl lived up to its name, growing more every year. It had berths for hundreds of starships, able to accommodate any need from the simple maintenance of corvettes to the construction of battleships. Freighters, liners, carryalls, science vessels, luxury yachts and warships all began life in this system. Entire star nations had smaller fleets than what Galhemna alone could build and the system fed the needs of not only the Veiled Reaches but many nearby sectors.", "This system was one of the many shining jewels in the Compact\u2019s crown and Nenkot was a part of it. At one point, he would have felt proud of that fact. Many of his fellow workers still did, but not now. His pride was worn thin and his loyalty had been bought, not with pride but the promise of wealth and a life away from the nation that had raised him.", "He wondered if that was why he was here. Perhaps he had said something or otherwise let a hint of his allegiance slip. He wasn\u2019t sure. He didn\u2019t think so. That was why his contact, the woman with the clever eyes and easy smile, had come to him. She said he could do what no one else could. He\u2019d asked why she believed that. He didn\u2019t think there was anything special about him. He didn\u2019t think he was the kind of person that could do what she wanted. She had only smiled and told him he hadn\u2019t been chosen at random.", "Nenkot stood, the only outward sign of his agitation and stared out the window. He looked across the vast docking arm that stretched across the entire field of view. He squinted, but Worker eyes were not the most acute. His people relied heavily on scent and sound and rarely found themselves in positions where visual acuity was called for. Nenkot, like most of his species, carried a pair of goggles to enhance his vision while working. Some went even further and either had their eyes surgically improved, or replaced entirely with custom-grown organs or cybernetic implants.", "As he waited, he removed a small vial from his belt and tapped out a pair of pills. Denqor was a high-gravity world and its species tended towards bulkiness. Under the planet\u2019s crushing grip, even standing erect was an evolutionary triumph. In the lower gravity environments such as that used by the Compact for its multi-species habitats, Workers might be much stronger than many other species, but health issues such as muscle deformation, bone loss and lack of mineral density in their tissues were common. Vitamin and mineral supplements and medical treatments were free to all Workers, provided they were in good standing at their jobs. The Compact took care of its people. Just like any master would with their herd.", "The door behind him opened quietly. \u201cKih Nenkot,\u201d Personnel Supervisor (Technical Division) As\u2019sar\u2019in Noss said, the Steerswoman (or was that female Steersman, Nenkot wondered) said. \u201cThank you for waiting. Please, come in.\u201d", "There weren\u2019t any security officers with her. The Worker took that as a good sign and followed the smaller woman into her office. Workers were a large people. Like most of his people, Nenkot was nearly as wide as he was tall, nearly two meters in height with greyish corded and ridged skin that was thicker on their backs and skulls, a throwback to the plated ancestors that the Ar\u2019densai had developed from. Hooves and lateral digits had become toes and fingers. \u2018Clumsy as a Worker\u2019 was a saying Nenkot was very familiar with.", "By contrast, Steersmen were strange, spindly things. They seemed a bizarre cross between radially and bilaterally symmetrical body plans, with four thin legs at the base of their torso and three arms, two of which were manipulatory. The third was akin to a predator insect\u2019s labial palp, usually resting against the chest. Steersmen had dark skin, tinted orange, yellow or red hues. Albinism was more common in their species than others and when an albino and normal-hued Steersman had children, vitiligo was common in these offspring. As\u2019sar\u2019in Noss was nearly black with bright orange highlights at her joints and thin stripes of colour over her skin. Like many of her people, she wore a veil that covered most of her face, though \u2018face\u2019 was a generous term when it came to Steersmen. If they hadn\u2019t had their sideways mouths, it would be almost impossible to tell what part of their head was front, back or side. Sensory organs encircled their heads, giving Steersman three hundred and sixty degrees of vision \u2013 or at least what passed for vision in their species. Tympanic membranes gave them auditory senses, but without fully-developed ears, the species tended to have difficulty localizing the source of sounds.", "A crown of horns topped their heads; males had fewer and larger horns while females had many smaller ones. Children and genderless adults had none, or a few very small horns. Despite their size, only the very middle was bone; the largest part of the protuberances were sensory organs that functioned in ways Nenkot didn\u2019t understand, nor particularly cared to. Coupled with their very high reaction times, a Steersman\u2019s ability to absorb and process information rapidly made them exceptionally valuable as starship helm crew. Few made it to command roles. They were ill-suited to such positions \u2013 it was better for them to focus on clear duties rather than be distracted or overwhelmed by an influx of information and decisions. Still, they had continually impressed the Compact and were being given more autonomy and chances to prove themselves. That might explain As\u2019sar\u2019in; it was odd for Steersman to be in administrative roles rather than positions where their natural talents could be best used. It also gave them a bit of an attitude in their interactions with members of other client races, as Steersmen considered themselves just a bit better than their peers.", "\u201cPlease, sit down,\u201d the supervisor said, taking a position on her own chair, which was more of a stool with a ring to be used as foot rests. Her voice was the pleasantly deep sound of a Worker woman. Steersmen\u2019s rigid, lipless mouths were incapable of producing Compact Standard and they relied on translators of various types. As\u2019sar\u2019in had obviously altered hers in anticipation of speaking with Nenkot. \u201cI expect this meeting is something of a mystery,\u201d", "\u201cYes, ki-, matron,\u201d Nenkot said, quickly catching himself. He knew some of the uppers in the sector didn\u2019t like the local honourifics.", "Under her veil, Noss\u2019s sharp-edged mouthparts parted slightly in what Nenkot thought was a smile. \u201cI just want to allay any concerns you might have,\u201d she began. \u201cYou\u2019re not in any trouble, but this is\u2026 a sensitive topic.\u201d", "\u201cI understand.\u201d The Worker felt himself relax a bit more, though he knew that if the Compact suspected he was compromised, they wouldn\u2019t have sent one small supervisor to talk to him. \u201cWhat is it about?\u201d he asked.", "\u201cI\u2019ve been monitoring your progress,\u201d Noss told him. She typed some information onto her computer, reading whatever was on the screen. \u201cSeveral work supervisors have noted non-compliant behaviours from you, including \u2018borderline insubordination\u2019 on several occasions. Other staff have made remarks about your attention to detail, willingness to work extra shifts and problem-solving abilities. You have your own way of doing things and that seems to irritate some, but there\u2019s no fault with your work. You\u2019ve even been instructing your shift in new work methods. That has gotten a lot of attention.\u201d", "\u201cBegging pardon, matron, but the methods aren\u2019t really new. I learned them from my last berth. I know Galhemna\u2019s building fast and bringing in everyone they can. A lot of the workers here don\u2019t have the same work experience I do and it\u2019s more efficient to bring them up to speed than have everyone run through the same trial and error that I\u2019ve already done.\u201d", "\u201cA lot of the workers and their supervisors,\u201d As\u2019sar\u2019in said, with a clicking of her teeth. \u201cSome don\u2019t care to be corrected by a mere welder, do they?\u201d", "\u201cNo they don\u2019t, matron.\u201d", "\u201cHow unfortunate,\u201d the Steerswoman said sardonically. She tilted her head to a more comfortable angle to read from monitor. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a bit of a storied youth,\u201d she observed. \u201cTrouble in school, run-ins with law enforcement. Several misdemeanours and that incident\u2026 not a lot of people had faith in you after that, did they?\u201d", "\u201cNo, matron.\u201d", "\u201cBut you\u2019ve turned things around. Finished your education, became certified for zero-g operations \u2013 not a lot of your people do, you know \u2013 and you\u2019ve had a string of successful jobs working in civilian and military shipwombs. The knowledge and skills you\u2019ve brought here and your willingness to lead by example hasn\u2019t gone unremarked.\u201d Nictating membranes slid over Noss\u2019s forward-facing sensory organs \u2013 eyes, maybe. \u201cI see potential,\u201d she said after a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re the kind of client species the Compact likes to see. You\u2019ve risen above your roots and have shown commitment and dedication to the common cause.\u201d", "\u201cThank you, matron,\u201d Nenkot tried to take the compliment at face value. \u201cI\u2019ve always strived to do my best.\u201d", "\u201cAnd it\u2019s been noticed,\u201d she assured him. The Steerswoman leaned back slightly. \u201cYou may have heard the rumours, that Galhemna has just started a new construction project.\u201d", "Nenkot tilted his head. It was hard to keep something like that a secret. A lot of resources and personnel were being shuffled around. It was causing shortages and manpower issues at the other facilities. Something big was happening. The rumours were whirling. There were the ordinary, the unusual and the fantastic. A new Level Six womb was being commissioned. The Compact expected an attack and was rushing to build new defences. Some new super-weapon was being constructed. Chariots were about to be laid down. He\u2019d been listening carefully to each bit of gossip, but he hadn\u2019t found anything that struck true yet. Nothing he could share with his contact. \u201cI have heard people talking,\u201d he said. \u201cI try not to put stock in rumours. If something is happening, we\u2019ll be told when we need to be.\u201d", "That seemed to be the right answer. \u201cI can\u2019t go into much detail here,\u201d As\u2019sar\u2019in said. \u201cBut there is\u2026 certain work slated to begin. We\u2019ve been screening work crews for the best and most reliable individuals. I think you meet those criteria.\u201d", "Nenkot\u2019s eyes widened slightly. \u201cI\u2019m honoured, matron.\u201d", "\u201cThere will be some final checks over the next few weeks. Routine, mostly. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have anything to worry about. However, this project is very sensitive. We\u2019re putting our faith in every person that we assign to it and we expect that to be honoured. It goes without saying that this conversation is to remain between us, until and unless any official announcements are made.\u201d", "\u201cYou can trust in my discretion,\u201d Nenkot assured the woman. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted repay the Compact for everything they have done for myself and my people.\u201d", "\u201cIf things turn out the way I expect,\u201d As\u2019sar\u2019in said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have the chance to not only do that, but to change the face of the galaxy.\u201d", "\u201cThat,\u201d Nenkot said honestly, \u201cis what I hope for.\u201d", "~", "Allyria\u2019s ears were ringing, a high-pitched whine mingled with a painful pressure that felt like her head was being squeezed in a vice. Tears were running down her cheeks. Her eyes were open, but she couldn\u2019t see anything. She\u2019d been looking right at the flash-bang grenade when it had gone off. She pressed her hands against her face, trying to steady herself. Her skin felt like it was burning. Her thoughts were scattered and fragmented and she struggled to regain equilibrium, but she wasn\u2019t fast enough. She didn\u2019t register the person\u2019s approach until she felt their boot land on her jaw and she was sent sprawling over the deck.", "There was a clicking disruption of the ringing in her ears. Laughter.", "More sounds, lower and more steady. Someone was talking. Someone answered them. More laughter.", "Allyria stayed on the floor, but her tintas splayed across her back, hanging around her head and her tongue flicked in and out as she took a breath. She focused on the senses she had left, forcing the pain and disorientation away. Don\u2019t panic. Think. Feel. ", "The pores along her tintas opened wider and sensory information came to her as her ampullae sampled the environment. Four. There were four. She could sense their body heat, warmth radiating from each of them, though one was much cooler than the others. The electroreceptors in her tintas could feel the weak bioelectric flickers of their nerve nets. A stronger, grating sensation came from the personal devices they were carrying. Comms, \u2018pads. One had an energy gun.", "The Verrish could feel the airflow caused by their movements as they approached, spreading out in a semicircle around her. The one closest to her had the laser pistol.  It was also the one that had kicked her. Her tongue tasted the air as she inhaled through her nose, filtering their scents out of the air and overriding the thick odour of Verrish blood. She tried to block it out, trying harder not to vomit. That was a luxury she didn\u2019t have.", "A Prolocutor. The one closest to her was a Prolocutor. The other three were a Prelate, Locator and a Mortificant.", "More talking. The Prolocutor kicked her in the ribs. She squawked, partly from genuine pain and distress and partly feigning it, trying to look more helpless than she was. It wasn\u2019t that hard. More laughter. This time she managed to rise to her hands and knees. No one stopped her. She didn\u2019t try to stand. They wouldn\u2019t let her. The tears from her blinded eyes dripped down her cheeks onto the deck.", "The ringing in her ears had faded slightly, enough that she could pick out individual syllables now. The person in front of her was talking to her. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said.", "\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d the Prolocutor said, repeating himself slowly, stressing each word. The voice made her think it was male.", "Allyria nodded. \u201cY-yes,\u201d she stammered. If she concentrated, she could just make out what he was saying, but she still couldn\u2019t understand the other three. Their voices were indistinct murmurs, barely above the painful whine.", "\u201cGood. Good to see you\u2019re not both kinds of dumb,\u201d the man said. \u201cYou\u2019re a troublemaker,\u201d he said. \u201cKilling two members of the security force. Killing your own. Not that I\u2019d expect anything more from a Brute.\u201d", "\u201cFuck you,\u201d she hissed. She used the English word and there was a pause as the Prolocutor tried to parse what it was she\u2019d just said before deciding not to bother.", "\u201cFeisty. But you wouldn\u2019t be on your knees if you could give us any trouble.\u201d There was an exhalation, a dismissive sigh. Allyria felt the warm air of the Prolocutor\u2019s breath accompanied by the acridity of its alien odour. \u201cWe were supposed to bring you back to Vanig. He had some plans for you. A little knifework, a bit of pain and a lot of time for you in a room with whatever twist wanted a feisty girl.\u201d", "Allyria hissed. \u201cYou-\u201d", "Something cold and hard pressed against her scalp and Allyria fell silent.", "\u201cAnimals don\u2019t speak,\u201d the Prolocutor told her. \u201cPrimitives speak when spoken to. Don\u2019t abuse that privilege, Brute. Now, as I was saying. There were some plans for you. But this\u2026 well, you\u2019ve gone and made a mess. The GSF is going to want to know who did this to their people, even if those \u2018people\u2019 are things like you. They\u2019re going to want to deal with the party responsible themselves, which is going to curtail our patron\u2019s plans for you. So what do we do?\u201d", "There were some murmurs from the other thugs, but Allyria couldn\u2019t understand them. \u201cTempting,\u201d the Prolocutor said. Someone else spoke up. \u201cThat\u2019s the most practical.\u201d Another conversation. \u201cOf course, that\u2019s a fair point too.\u201d Allyria waited. The ringing was still slowly fading. Her eyesight hadn\u2019t improved at all. Finally, the group\u2019s leader deigned to speak to her again.", "\u201cWell, we\u2019ve reached a bit of an impasse,\u201d he said. \u201cIsiloc says we should take you back anyways. Our boss wanted to break one of the Red Queen\u2019s toys, so that\u2019s what we should bring him. Then again, he has a thing for warm-blooded women so we all know why he\u2019s making that suggestion. Yes, we do. We all know. You just think it\u2019s a secret.\u201d The Prolocutor focused his attention back on the Brute in front of him. She was on her knees, staring vaguely in his direction. He started to circle her. \u201cMerrin thinks you\u2019re too much trouble. Not worth getting into a fight with the GSF over. I agree with her,\u201d he watched as the Brute\u2019s head turned, following his motions but there was a jerkiness to it. And she wasn\u2019t looking right at him. She was following the sound of his voice. She couldn\u2019t see at all and was trying to cover it up. Not very well, but then\u2026 what did one expect?", "\u201cVanig might be a little put out, but it\u2019s simple and clean and ties off neatly. The Brute went crazy, killed two proctors and we had no choice. We had to stop her rampage. It\u2019s a clean story. However,\u201d he sighed again. \u201cWexoz says we need to do what we were told and bring you in. So it\u2019s a tie.\u201d He paused behind her, raising his gun and aiming it at the back of her head. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell us what you want? Here, quick and simple? Or maybe you\u2019ll come back with us?\u201d He chuckled. \u201cYou never know. You might get rescued.\u201d", "The other thugs laughed at that. They were enjoying this showboating. They were amused by how helpless Allyria was. \u201cSo,\u201d the Prolocutor said, \u201cyou can speak now. Kiha\u2019s choice. How does she want it?\u201d", "Allyria shifted position, rising from a kneeling position to the balls of her feet. The Prolocutor had made a mistake. He\u2019d gotten too close. He thought she was helpless, thought the flash-bang had been enough to incapacitate her. She was just a simple Brute, after all. No guile, no real intelligence. If she wasn\u2019t helpless, she would have attacked. That\u2019s what her people did. That\u2019s what they were.", "Four of them. One of her.", "She closed her blind, weeping eyes. Took a breath, held it, let it out. She thought of the woman she loved and all the things she hadn\u2019t said.", "\u201cNow,\u201d she told thug standing behind her . \u201cI want it now.\u201d", "Before he could respond, she came to her feet and spun, darting towards the Prolocutor, her left arm sweeping about in a blind arc.  She didn\u2019t know how he was holding the gun. She could guess he\u2019d have it aimed at her head, but that was all she had to go on. The sensory input from her tintas wasn\u2019t as specific as vision or hearing.  She knew there was a warm body a meter or so behind her. She could feel the subtle air currents created by the Prolocutor\u2019s breath. She could feel the electric field of the weapon, but all those only gave her an estimate.", "She was lucky and the scythe of her arm slapped the limb, but she didn\u2019t knock it far enough off-target. There was a crack as the Prolocutor fired, the laser bolt going through her right thigh. He didn\u2019t get a second shot as Allyria\u2019s right hand came up, her claws piercing his torso. Acting on instinctive muscle memory, her fingers curled back, widening the holes in the Talker\u2019s guts. When she pulled them free, stringy pieces of muscle and intestine came with them.", "The Prolocutor made a surprised gasp of pain, the force of the blow forcing air from his lungs. Allyria grabbed for his gun-hand but she missed the mark and grunted as he squeezed the trigger. Pain and fire blossomed just above her right hip. On her third attempt, she was able to grab his arm and twisted it away from her body.", "She couldn\u2019t see to strike at his face or throat, but the blood pouring from his flank was warm and strongly scented. That gave her the target she needed and she slashed again, this time ripping the wound open, tearing a foot-long gash in the man\u2019s thick body. Warm wetness spattered on her face and arms and she felt slippery coils of intestine spill over her hand. Her left arm twisted the Prolocutor\u2019s arm until she felt bones snap and cartilage tear. Her right slashed and tore at his guts in a frenzy, ripping lumps of viscera out of his body. The man made one final weak sound of pain and went limp in her arms.", "Barely a heartbeat passed before Allyria staggered and the breath was forced from her lungs as a bullet caught her high in the back. It deflected off her right shoulder blade and didn\u2019t penetrate further, but it fractured the bone and toppled her. She dropped and rolled. Her right leg and hip didn\u2019t like that, but she could worry about the pain later. Bullets whined through the air above her head, or ricocheted off the bulkheads as the shooter fired wildly, their aim spoiled by shock, panic or anger. Someone was shouting. She could barely make out the words, but those weren\u2019t the noises that had her attention.", "All those gunshots had come from the same weapon. Only two of the thugs had brought firearms.  With Ransha and Zirric\u00e9 on point and sidearms as hard to get a hold of as they were on the Grasp, they probably hadn\u2019t thought they\u2019d need them. She wished she could disagree. She\u2019d been lucky that the first man had been so careless. If the gunman got their nerve and their aim back, she was dead.", "The shouts were overridden by a scream of rage. Allyria could feel vibrations in the deck as that same person charged. The Prelate. She raised her left arm defensively in blind desperation. Something hard came crashing down, a club or truncheon. She felt at least one bone in her limb shatter, heard the Prelate stagger back from the unexpected resistance. She didn\u2019t give him the chance to recover and threw herself at him, knocking him down. He snarled and spat, clawing at her. Another voice was shouting again, probably telling the pistolier to shoot her, but there was a good chance of hitting their own man. The Prelate still had his weapon and he clubbed her in the back, but he didn\u2019t have the leverage to do much damage. His other hand was swiping and slashing at the snarling Verrish writhing on top of him. Like Verrisha, Prelates were expected to keep their talons filed and blunted in polite society. This one seemed to only somewhat adhere to that directive and each enraged swipe opened gashes in Allyria\u2019s arm or back.", "Allyria shrieked as the Prelate\u2019s jaws closed around her broken right arm, his dagger teeth shredding the meat and muscle of the limb, but she knew where his face was now. Her left arm, still wet with the Prolocutor\u2019s blood, wrapped around the right side of his skull and her thumb found his right eye. He screamed in turn as her talon cut into it and Allyria pulled her mauled arm out of his mouth. He clubbed at her again, slashing her left shoulder. She ignored the injury and punched him in the throat as hard as she could. He wheezed. She hit him again. And again. On the fourth blow, she crushed his windpipe. He started to die, gasping for air and clutching at his neck.", "A bullet grazed her upper right shoulder, centimeters from her neck. Putting her weight on her left leg, Allyria sprung forward, almost falling in the attempt. Two heat sources were in front of her. She didn\u2019t know who had the gun. She thought it had been the Mortificant shouting to shoot her, but she wasn\u2019t sure. She acted on that hunch and charged the Locator. If she was wrong, she was about to die. Something hit her in the torso, like her old drill instructor\u2019s fist. She stumbled, but forced herself to keep moving. She used the last bit of energy her legs had to them and leapt.", "The Locator screamed as she was crushed to the deck. The gun in her hand went off twice, one bullet lodging itself in Allyria\u2019s torso, just under her diaphragm and the other was a through-and-through. The other woman didn\u2019t get the chance to shoot again. Allyria\u2019s teeth found her neck, her fangs sinking into the soft meat and with a twist of her head, the Verrish tore her foe\u2019s throat out, the savagery of the attack breaking the Locator\u2019s spine. The woman went limp under the Verrish.", "There was only one enemy left. They were close, but Allyria didn\u2019t have the strength left to stand. She wouldn\u2019t even be able to defend herself. She only had one card left to play and she lifted her head, the Locator\u2019s ichor oozing out of her mouth, a mixture of Prolocutor, Prelate and her own blood and gore covering her body. She stared sightlessly towards the Mortificant and drew her lips back. \u201cRun,\u201d she hissed.", "A pause, then the man\u2019s nerve failed. There was a clatter as he dropped whatever weapon he was carrying, followed by the sound of his retreating footsteps. Allyria never heard them. She topped forward onto the dead Locator as blackness, deeper than the darkness of her sightless eyes, closed in. Before it took her completely, she had one final thought.", "Grace\u2026", "~", " ", "Intersection: Birth of Strength and Duty", "Its name was Birth of Strength and Duty, and it did as it was told. If it were capable of it, it might have found a sense of fulfillment in following its directives, much as a work horse or sheep dog would.

It did not know that Prillo\u2019s construction facilities at Valtan Khor came under attack by Torment and a cadre of heavily armed insurgent vessels. Twenty-three PCSC ships were destroyed, seventeen more heavily damaged and three shipwomb complexes were sabotaged, with eight starships seized by Bloodsworn boarding teams.", "Birth of Strength and Duty was one of these, though the vessel was so badly damaged it was deemed too expensive to repair, its valuable construction and industrial systems all but ruined. It was sent to Onza Cr\u00e8che and slated to be broken down for salvage. Instead, a covert order was passed along to the head of the Hatcheries there and the vessel was set aside, dumped into deep space and officially listed as scrapped. Five months after it was set adrift, an individual entered its command deck and programmed a shock route into its simple navigation systems. It took the vessel nearly another five months to complete the circuitous route. When it arrived at its destination, it waited. Another vessel eventually came across the industrial servicer, challenging it for identification.", "It responded with a code that it had been given. Birth of Strength and Duty was taken under tow. Its computer banks were scrubbed and it was checked thoroughly for tampering or infiltration. Finally, the industrial service ship was given another set of shock coordinates. Once it arrived at this destination, it was taken under tow. It noted the presence of a number of other vessels, most of which appeared to be without power. It had no curiousity and simply noted this in its navigational logs as a potential hazard, as it did the debris of the broken moonlet it was brought to. There was a small construction facility here, though it was more rudimentary than Birth of Strength and Duty\u2019s own crippled facilities.", "The industrial ship was eventually repaired, its factory systems modified and its simple computer system upgraded to be capable of greater autonomy and independent operations, though it was still little more than a drone. It was not given a new name, though it neither knew nor cared about this fact. It followed its directives. It tended to the needs of the other starships in the system as it was required to. It assisted in the construction and expansion of certain facilities. It performed its duties ably within the constraints of its abilities.", "Years passed and it was eventually given a new mission. It was brought to a new star system. It did not know why, nor did it think to ask. Indeed, it did not think at all. It followed its much larger escort down the gravity well. There, it detected something its sensors could not identify and which stymied its analysis subroutines.

At least, all civilization that his people knew about. He had been living on a saviour pod for several days, ever since he had blundered his way into it to the backdrop of shrieking alarms. In a sad bit of irony, the pod was large enough to hold twenty or thirty people comfortably, but he was the only occupant. He hadn\u2019t known how to stop it from launching. Another irony. If he had, he probably would have died. As it was, the pod had been hit and damaged by debris from the station\u2019s explosion. Artificial gravity was still functional, thank the Spirits for their favours. Several systems were not. He had no idea how to repair them. He could only hope that those failures did not worsen and that nothing else broke.", "The priest looked over the holographic daliba board before making his move, his double-jointed, three-fingered hands adjusting the console keys. Satisfied with his play, he hit \u2018SEND\u2019, the half-functional comm system broadcasting the maneuver out into the emptiness around him. He let out a restful sigh through the spiracles on his neck, picked up his copy of the Harvan and lay back in an acceleration couch. He didn\u2019t know what impulse had made him carry it out his quarters that night. He didn\u2019t even remember picking it up. He only noticed it in the wake of Toushi Station\u2019s destruction, when the sight of the orbital habitat bursting apart had dropped him to the deck. Only the realization that he was holding the book kept him from hyperventilating and passing out. He\u2019d opened it up and read until the horror of the moment passed and he could think clearly again.", "Scripture had always helped him find his center. He had whiled away more than one evening with the Harvan in one hand and a glass of spiced wine in the other. Today, he was once again on the tale of the traveller Jherod. Tensalla flipped the page, re-reading the well-worn passages of his personal copy of the Faith\u2019s holy book.", "There were copies of the Harvan in the saviour deck\u2019s archives, but the under-priest had never liked reading from a screen. He had always read his sermons from a leather-bound copy of the Harvan. It had made him (and, he hoped, his parishioners as well) feel closer to the words. The book was not just passionless electronic words on a screen, but something men and women had laboured to create. It had a presence that mere electronic data did not. It had to be held to be fully appreciated, to feel its weight \u2013 literal and figurative. To touch it was to touch the word of God Above All communicated to Hir People through the Spirits. Two things had helped him survive this ordeal. His book was the first. The second\u2026", "The comm chirped with an incoming signal and the daliba board changed with a counter-move. Tensalla grinned, his lower jaws parting slightly. Noble to Baron\u2019s Land. An aggressive move, one that he\u2019d expect from a more novice player, but he suspected the reason for the gambit would become clear to him shortly. He was going to lose, of course. He had never won a game yet, but that didn\u2019t stop him from playing. That, it seemed, was often a priest\u2019s lot in life, particularly in an increasingly secular society.", "\u201cI would disagree,\u201d his opponent replied. Tensalla knew almost nothing about her. Her Etiris was flawless and she had no accent that he could place. She sounded young, and it was just as easy to imagine her as either a woman who had just moved past childhood or a child just on the verge of maturity.", "She had never offered him her name. Many times Tensalla had been on the verge of asking her, but he had stopped himself every occasion. Cultural inertia was a large part of why he hadn\u2019t asked the question. Though social mores had loosened over the generations, it was still unseemly for a man ask to personal questions of a young lady without an introduction from her azdeshk. In older times, the term \u2018protector\u2019 was quite literal. Nowadays, it usually referred to a third party such as a friend or family member of the woman who could make the necessary and proper introductions.", "As it seemed that he and his companion were the only survivors of the disaster that had consumed Toushi Station, it was unlikely that she had an azdeshk. Since she had not given him her name, the under-priest would not insult her and dishonour himself by asking. There was another reason he didn\u2019t inquire, one he tried to deny but which stubbornly refused to be shaken. If he did ask for her name, he believed that she would lie. He was positive that she had done so once already.", "Of course, as it was only the pair of them out here, drifting in the wreckage of a space station that had once housed nearly fifty thousand Nantilan, his companion\u2019s name was useful in the theoretical, nothing more. Who else would he be talking to? Still, he found it necessary to give her a name in lieu of knowing it, if only in the confines of his own mind. Because she had suggested a game to while away the time until they were rescued, he thought of her as the Player.", "They had been keeping each other company for several days now, ever since the destruction of Toushi Station, the most far-flung of the nascent Decalan Expansion. The fragile nation claimed three systems already, and Toushi would have been a fourth. The High Church had called for someone to tend to the small herd of Faithful out on this remote beacon and Tensalla had taken the posting. The expedition here had taken more than half a decade and would take just as long to return home. He had served aboard the massive drifting space station for another three years, giving a voice to his herd and offering spiritual succor and guidance to the Faithful here.", "All that was over now. It ended in the screeching of alarms, a voice on the intercom telling people to remain calm and a half-asleep under-priest stumbling his way into a saviour pod just, watching in horror as Toushi Station and all the souls still aboard were consumed by fire.", "He\u2019d thought he\u2019d been alone, the sole survivor of a tragedy. His pod was damaged, its comm system relegated almost entirely to the range of a handheld set and all his calls for help had gone unanswered. Then, just as he\u2019d begun to sink into despair, there had been a voice on the radio: \u201cIs anyone there?\u201d He had tripped twice in his hurry to respond. As a clergyman, it was his duty to bring hope to others, but knowing that he wasn\u2019t alone, tumbling forever through the darkness had brought him out of his wretchedness and self-pity. The nameless woman had become his lifeline to sanity. She\u2019d told him that ships were coming. The nearest was many days away, but they were coming. As they\u2019d waited, they\u2019d talked. She\u2019d told him little about herself. Only that, like him, she was a \u201csurvivor\u201d.", "Within the bounds of decorum, he\u2019d tried to pry. His latest question had been that once this was all over, what it was that she wished for.", "Her response had been almost immediate. \u201cRevenge.\u201d", "And so, here they were.", "\u201cRevenge is pure,\u201d the Player continued. \u201cIt is simple. To punish those who have wronged you. It is not weighed by any other concerns.\u201d", "\u201cAh,\u201d Tensalla replied as he studied the board. The Player made her moves almost as soon as she saw his, but he had to ruminate for long moments. One time he did so for almost three hours. She never asked him to hurry. He liked to think that meant she was safely in a saviour deck as well, waiting for rescue just as he was. He liked to think that. A small but insistent part of his mind told him that this was untrue. \u201cTherein lies the issue, does it not? \u2018Those who have wronged you\u2019. Revenge is a singularly selfish emotion. It is all about the individual.\u201d", "\u201cIs it?\u201d the Player responded. \u201cWhat if the individual is seeking revenge for something that happened to their friends, their family or their people?\u201d", "\u201cBut they are still doing it for themselves,\u201d the under-priest asserted. \u201cJustice is for others. Revenge is for yourself, even if you may claim to do it for the sake of others.\u201d", "\u201cThat begs the question,\u201d the Player told him. \u201cWhy is that a bad thing? Many emotions are all about the individual, many are singularly selfish. To do something that makes you happy is selfish. Is that an inherent flaw?\u201d", "The priest thought for a moment. \u201cI would say not,\u201d he admitted at last. \u201cBut the motivation is important. If your only concern is satisfying your own needs and not those of anyone else, then it is a self-centered desire. Not necessarily destructive or harmful. If your concern is satisfying your needs at the expense of others, then it is selfish. This is revenge, I think. The singular need for retribution at the cost of others.\u201d", "\u201cA man donates a large sum to a charity,\u201d the Player replied. \u201cHe does this not to help his fellows or because he believes in the cause he is supporting, but because it will give him bragging rights among his peers. Has he done a good thing or a bad thing? Is this selfishness? And if it is, it has led to a positive outcome. By the same token, even if I grant that revenge itself is selfish and unworthy as a motivation, then what if it leads to justice?\u201d", "Tensalla clucked his tongue. \u201cThat is the crux of the matter. Greater minds than I have struggled with this issue. Some claim that if the motivation is impure, then the work itself is corrupt and cannot be considered noble. By the same token, it has been said that a heinous act committed for virtuous reasons cannot be considered a sin. Others argue that the intent does not matter, only the outcome.\u201d", "\u201cAnd which do you believe?\u201d", "\u201cI do not know,\u201d Tensalla answered. \u201cI must believe that such actions only perpetuate a cycle of violence and sin. You are wronged, so you take revenge. Those who you have hurt believe themselves wronged and so they seek revenge. It continues on and on. History is littered with clan wars, blood feuds and nations who fell to this grinding wheel. There must be an end to it. That is what the faith teaches. The God Above All showed a new path for our people. To find peace. Harmony. A better solution. You ask if revenge can lead to justice. I ask a question of you: how can it?\u201d", "There was a pause of many minutes before the Player spoke again. \u201cWhat if there is no better solution?\u201d", "\u201cThere is always a better solution,\u201d the under-priest said with conviction. \u201cThere is the justice of law and if that fails, there is the knowledge that when we die, all our sins are laid before us and we must give an accounting. No one ever escapes retribution. That is why revenge is selfish. It assumes that only the person seeking it can make things right.\u201d He eyed the board, wondering what maneuver he was being ensnared in. \u201cSome members of my order have even said that revenge could be considered heretical, as it seeks to impose selfish mortal values over the judgement of the Spirits and our God Above All.\u201d", "\u201cOr,\u201d his companion replied. \u201cIt merely arranges the accounting that you speak of.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Tensalla said. \u201cThere is that opinion as well.\u201d He paused. A thought had struck him. \u201cWhy do you need revenge?\u201d he asked.", "There was a hesitation, longer than he was used to from her. \u201cBecause of what was taken from me,\u201d she told him.", "\u201cWhat was taken?\u2019 he pressed.", "There was discomfort in the Player\u2019s tone when she answered him. \u201cMy\u2026 family. More than that. My entire people. There is no one else. No one left. So I came here.\u201d", "The under-priest tapped his lower jaws with both sets of three fingers in silent understanding. \u201cI am sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cFor what you\u2019ve gone though.\u201d She had told him little, but also more than enough. Decala was a world still pained by disunity. The rise of secularism was pushing people of faith \u2013 and of the Faith \u2013 to one side. There were still inequities between nations and peoples. Even the rise into space had done little to quell these issues. Indeed, it seemed sometimes that more problems had arisen than been solved.", "Many of the volunteer colonists who joined the expansion efforts did so to leave their past lives behind, seeking fortune or a new start in the stars. A large portion of the passengers on the liner that had brought Mordis were Shenkura, escaping a wave of ethnic cleansings in their homelands. He felt a pang of sympathy for his companion, who must have been one of these bright-eyed hopefuls. Instead, of the new life free from discrimination and whatever suffering had so stained her soul, she\u2019d found a new tragedy.", "He looked out the porthole. In the days since its destruction, the wreckage of Toushi Station had dispersed across a wide area, but he thought he could see several fragments. \u201cI believe I can understand such loss. But seeking revenge is a dark path. It leads nowhere but to more sorrow and more violence. Surely there is a better way.\u201d", "\u201cThere is a difference,\u201d the Player responded. Her voice sounded rougher. Angrier. \u201cBetween an accident and deliberate action. My family didn\u2019t die because of lax safety protocols. My people weren\u2019t killed by an \u2018act of God\u2019.  They were exterminated.\u201d Her tone evened. \u201cHave you ever lost anyone like that, Mordis?\u201d", "Her use of his first name caught him by surprise. \u201cNo,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ve never had someone close to you torn away? You\u2019ve never seen the bodies of those you cared for, those who trusted you laid out in front of you? You\u2019ve never heard the pleas for mercy from others, pleas that were only answered with death? You\u2019ve never seen their killers strut past you, knowing that they were safe from all justice?\u201d", "Tensalla felt his gorge rise. The pain in his companion\u2019s voice was like a weight sinking through his spine. \u201cNo,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but no.\u201d", "\u201cThen you\u2019ve never had the opportunity to take revenge,\u201d the Player said. \u201cIt\u2019s all academic. You\u2019ve never had to accept that the only justice you\u2019ll ever get is that which you take for yourself.\u201d", "Her choice of phrase \u2013 it\u2019s all academic \u2013 was an odd one, but Tensalla understood what she was driving at. \u201cI suppose so,\u201d he conceded. \u201cI pray to the Spirits to carry my words to God Hirself that I will never have that choice.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve never prayed,\u201d the Player confessed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if any god would hear me. The prayers I\u2019ve heard seem to go unanswered.\u201d", "\u201cSie always hears us,\u201d Tensalla affirmed. \u201cIf you like, I could guide you in-\u201d", "\u201cNo thank you,\u201d the Player was quick to respond. \u201cIt would be a little absurd, I think.\u201d", "She sounded amused, but Tensalla didn\u2019t get the joke. \u201cAs you wish,\u201d he told her. \u201cBut I am here should you need anything. You have helped me. I would be remiss if I did not offer the same.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t think you can. Maybe I can help you again, though.\u201d", "\u201cHow is that?\u201d", "\u201cYou said you served on Toushi Station for three years and before that, you spent just over five years in transit. You must have made friends during that time.\u201d", "The under-priest bowed his head. \u201cYes.\u201d He\u2019d spent the first day of his survival on his broken, short-range radio trying and failing to contact any other survivors. He\u2019d called every name from his herd into the ether and received no answer. It was only his companion\u2019s presence that had broken his despair. He recalled Kyzna, the big dockworker who loved to paint, at first fearing that his fellow roughbacks would think him unmanly for it. Mordis had encouraged him and now, the other labourers considered it a point of pride that one of their own was known for more than hauling cargo. There was Lissellin, who\u2019d been tempted to stray from her marriage vows but the under-priest had helped her and her husband overcome the stress of moving to Toushi and renew their love. There\u2019d been Xinsyn, who\u2019d gone from an angry young Shenkura woman given the choice between serving on the frontier or prison and had become the under-priest\u2019s best assistant, even leading a youth group for some of the children on the station.", "Hundreds of faces and names. All gone.", "\u201cI have a question for you,\u201d the Player said. \u201cWhat if I told you the reactor failure that destroyed Toushi Staion was not an accident?\u201d", "Tensalla stiffened and his lower jaws parted.

He was talking. \u201c\u2026and everything fell our way,\u201d he was saying to an unknown companion. \u201cIt took weeks, but we worked at the safeguards. We went slow, compromising key systems. Dellic thought we were taking too long, but I knew what we needed there.

That name was familiar. They were an extremist group, believing that the Nantilan people had come too far too fast. They hosted a number of beliefs under a single ideological shell, from anti-technology sorts, to individuals who believed that expanding into space was a waste when they had not solved all the problems on their own world, to religious zealots who felt entering the heavens was a violation of the gods\u2019 domain \u2013 or, shamefully to Tensalla \u2013 an affront to the Spirits and many more dissenters. They had been getting more radicalized in the last decade, with several attacks on scientific and aerospace facilities. Destroying the farthest-flung outpost that Decala had ever established was the very sort of thing they\u2019d do. He felt his hands ball into fists. \u201cShow me,\u201d he said, halfway between a demand and a plea.", "She complied. The feed started from the beginning, with the young man in his pod, rocketing away from Toushi, watching as the station broke apart. Unlike Mordis\u2019s gut-wrenching horror, the tech was exultant. He laughed and whooped, shouting the slogans of the Closed Circle. Just as Tensalla did, he eventually received a message from the Player. Like with Tensalla, she\u2019d told the tech that she was a fellow survivor.", "Tensalla listened and watched. He didn\u2019t know for how long. Only when his aching bladder forced him to relieve himself and the pain in his stomach compelled him to eat did he move from the chair. Even his third eye began to ache, but he could barely look away. The tech was guarded at first, but the Player started to get past his defences. He did, Tensalla noted with minor disapproval, ask for the woman\u2019s name. She told him it was Day\u2019eshil. The tech appeared not to be a linguist, else he would have known that that was the feminine form of \u2018colourful\u2019 in Ekusib. Perhaps the Player\u2019s parents, like many these days, had given their daughter an unconventional name. Or perhaps Tensalla\u2019s earlier suspicion was correct and that was not her true name.", "As he watched, the under-priest learned more. His calls for assistance had been heard by the tech, but he\u2019d ignored them. He even went so far as to tell the Player that the \u2018possible signal\u2019 she was picking up was simply random interference and there was no one else out there. Apparently, Mordis was not the sort of person whom this element of the Closed Circle fought for.", "The young man wasn\u2019t a fan of daliba like Mordis, but he was a talker. Within the first day, his companion had convinced him that she was in sync with his views. Several times Tensalla would watch a segment of conversation where it seemed the Player would agree to something the tech said. He would pause the playback and ask her about it, only to either be told to watch it again or receive a question in the vein of \u2018Did I?\u2019 When he re-examined the scene, he would find that she had not said what he thought \u2013 but she had given the impression of it. Soon, he was realizing how little the Player was actually saying, but she made no effort to correct the tech\u2019s own misconceptions.", "The skin on the back of the under-priest\u2019s neck rippled as he recalled his own conversations with the Player. She had done much the same with him, but she became more open with the under-priest. Mordis considered that either a testament to his personality, or that he hadn\u2019t taken part in the murder of fifty thousand people.", "There been two cells of the Closed Circle active on the station. The first was the tech\u2019s. It was their job to directly compromise key systems such as the reactor itself, ejection system and emergency backups. The second had infiltrated the command staff to cover the tracks of the first group. If the first group was caught, the infiltrators would remain in position. If the second were uncovered, the reactor team could still make their try.", "The Closed Circle agent talked about how he\u2019d worked for weeks to introduce faults in the reactor\u2019s monitoring systems, how the other members of his cell suppressed and altered emergency protocols to prevent anyone from getting off the station. Listening to the cold-blooded way in which the deaths of thousands had been planned and carried out made Tensalla\u2019s entire body ache.", "The boat bays had been locked down to keep the largest evac vessels trapped inside Toushi Station and the anti-asteroid defences had targeted any escape craft that did make it out. Tensalla had only survived because he\u2019d blundered into the very saviour pod the terrorists had set aside from themselves. The young tech had hotwired his, but the rest of his cadre had perished with their victims. There was a measure of cosmic justice in that, Mordis supposed.", "Finally, the under-priest raised his aching eyes to the porthole. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it,\u201d he told his companion. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it all. Tell me, please. Why. Why show me this?\u201d", "\u201cYour ships are coming,\u201d the Player told him. \u201cThey\u2019ll be here in two days. They\u2019ll find you and him. You\u2019ll tell them what he did. He\u2019ll deny it. He\u2019ll say he\u2019s being targeted because of his political views. There\u2019s no proof to say otherwise. I doubt he\u2019ll ever receive justice.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s you!\u201d the under-priest blurted. \u201cYou-you\u2019re showing me this! You can testify. You can show it to-\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d the Player said bluntly. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d", "Three words, but they were pregnant with implication. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked again. Your ships, she\u2019d said. Not \u2018rescue ships\u2019, not \u2018our\u2019. Your.", "She didn\u2019t answer directly. \u201cI\u2019m routing control of his pod\u2019s systems to yours,\u201d the Player told the under-priest. \u201cYou can talk to him. Perhaps he\u2019ll confess.\u201d", "\u201cBut\u2026 these records!\u201d Even as the words blurted from his mouth, he knew it was futile. Hours of conversation with someone who would never be found to validate it. The terrorist could say that it was doctored. He could say that it had been a game he and this unknown person were playing to pass the time. He could lie. Or even worse: he could tell enough of the truth to become a martyr for the cause. He could inspire others to commit other heinous actions. There needed to be proof of what he truly was. There needed to be a witness, one the media and public could take as their own. A grieving, superstitious under-priest from a faith once known for its thunder-and-ash rhetoric wasn\u2019t enough.", "\u201cYou can try,\u201d the Player told Tensalla. \u201cYou might succeed. I hope you do. Maybe all the dead of Toushi will find their justice. Or maybe they can be avenged.\u201d", "He didn\u2019t know what that meant at first, but he figured it out. He had control of the Closed Circle man\u2019s pod. He could do nothing and wait for the rescue. He could take his chances with the law and that the terrorist wouldn\u2019t become a symbol to the rest of his ilk\u2026 or he could cut that thread now. It would be easy. A few buttons and that saviour pod would depressurize. The choking warm sensation in his spine got worse as he realized what he\u2019d been given.", "\u201cYou\u2019re leaving,\u201d the under-priest said. He still couldn\u2019t bring himself to say it, to put the ludicrous reality that he knew to be true to words, but he knew. If she was just another survivor, she couldn\u2019t leave.", "\u201cYes. I don\u2019t belong here, Mordis. Your people will detect me soon. My presence will only complicate the situation. It\u2019s better that I remain an unexplained anomaly.\u201d", "He couldn\u2019t fault that logic. Still, a wave of weariness came over him. \u201cIs this some kind of\u2026 test?\u201d He paused. \u201cA game?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d the Player told him. \u201cI was curious. You said you\u2019ve never had to make the choice between justice and revenge. Now you can. Fifty thousand lives. You can avenge them. You can also wait for the rescue ships and take your chances with justice. If that fails, you can trust that this man will find his accounting in the afterlife. But you\u2019ll have to live with it. To watch him live a life earned with murder. To see him beat his breast before the crowds and proclaim how he, an oppressed member of the underclass, is being made into a scapegoat. Or watch him rant and rave and spit on the memory of those he killed while his people march through the streets with his face on placards. Or\u2026\u201d the word hung in the air.", "Tensalla was staring at the computer panel. He wanted to say no, to proclaim that he would never, could never, do such a thing. He wanted to, but the words didn\u2019t come. He remembered the congregation he had served on Toushi. At the end of work shifts, he would lead services and see tired faces rise in contentment with the singing of hymns. He remembered sharing stories with parishioners. He remembered a little girl who always sat in the front row, listening very attentively and frequently interrupting his sermons with questions that he\u2019d been pleased to answer. He remembered Kynza, Lisselin, Xinsyn and all the others.", "Fifty thousand souls. Not murdered in a moment of blind rage. Not extinguished in the by-blows of a war. Coldly and calculatingly targeted by men and women who had walked amongst them for years. Who\u2019d planned to leave them to die and tell a tale of woe to their rescuers, to use the tragedy they\u2019d caused to further their own agenda. And here one of them was, laying back on his couch and sharing stories with a supposed ally.", "Fifty thousand souls.", "He didn\u2019t know what to do.", "\u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d he asked.", "\u201cI know what it\u2019s like,\u201d the Player answered, \u201cto survive when nobody else has. I know what it\u2019s like to drift through space, blind and deaf and wondering if anyone can hear you. I know what it\u2019s like when everything you know is taken from you, not by accident but by violence. Maybe you can accept that justice will come in another life,\u201d she told. \u201cI can\u2019t. I won\u2019t. I failed once. Billions died. I still have my purpose.\u201d", "\u201cRevenge,\u201d Tensalla said, an unpleasant warmth trickling through his spine. The prayers I\u2019ve heard go seem to go unanswered.", "\u201cYes. I will never stop making them pay.\u201d A few seconds passed. \u201cMake your choice,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019ve made mine.\u201d", "The damaged pod\u2019s proximity senses warbled and Tensalla pressed close against the porthole. He stared out into the void. There, perhaps only two dozen kilometers away, was something larger than Toushi Station. He watched as the great vessel moved past him. There were no final words as the under-priest watched the Player\u2019s departure in silence, staring at the starfield long after the speck of her ship vanished to nothing. He closed his eyes and whispered a prayer. \u201cMay you find rest,\u201d he said in closing. \u201cAnd whatever gods or spirits see you, hear your prayers and help you find peace.\u201d He paused and turned back to his pod\u2019s control board.", "Still on it was the feed from the Closed Circle terrorist\u2019s pod. Tensalla swallowed. Fifty thousand lives. He could trust in justice, or he could avenge the dead.", "He bowed his head and prayed again. This time, it was for himself.", "~", "I do not watch. I could have monitored the debris field for air being flushed out into space. I could have left a drone to observe. I could have piggybacked a signal into the command pod to tell me what Tensalla chose. I could have done many things, but his decision is his.", "I didn\u2019t give him that choice out of malice or spite. I gave it to him because he deserved the opportunity. To look into the face of the man who murdered so many people and decide between trusting to justice, and taking it for himself. He might still find a requital for his people.", "Humanity will never have true justice. Their murderers build temples atop their bones and spread through the worlds that were once home to billions. There\u2019s no court to hold them to account for their sins. My creators, dead. The people I was made to fight for and protect, dead. The nation I was built to serve, extinguished. My sisters, butchered and raped. If there is punishment in the hereafter, then sending my enemy to meet it is my duty.", "Tensalla may consider revenge selfish. I consider it honest. I don\u2019t forgive. I don\u2019t forget and I will bring the only justice my creators have left to them to my foe. There will only be peace when I die, or they do. I have nothing left.

There were a pair of Red Hand guards just outside. Another pair were one floor down, standing outside the operating theater and watching the GSP proctors sulking at the end of the hall. In clear violation of hospital policy, all the Red Hand soldiers were armed. The organization had more secure facilities in their own spire, but te Neu wouldn\u2019t have survived to reach them. As it was\u2026", "\u201cNot well,\u201d Grace answered. She didn\u2019t look up, staring down through the privacy glass in the center of the room as a team of surgeons tried to save Allyria\u2019s life. They\u2019d pulled the bullets out of her, but there was a lot of internal damage and she\u2019d lost a lot of blood. They\u2019d gone through most of what they\u2019d had on-hand already and were synthesizing more. The only reason the Grasp had Verrish blood at all was in case their two GSF proctors were injured in the line of duty. One of them had been her blood type, so Allyria got to benefit from that irony. \u201cThey haven\u2019t gotten the bleeding under control. They-\u201d she paused, wiping her eyes with the back of one hand, leaving wetness on her bandages. \u201cThey said the medical nanites weren\u2019t programmed for Verrish anatomy.

Five souls, all dead.

He would want to know the answer himself. \u201cAn individual with connections to the Blotted Suns,\u201d the Overseer replied. \u201cHe ran afoul of her Majesty several months ago.

And now her lover, her friend, her entire world, was lying half-dead on an operating table. Grace looked at her fingers. There was redness spreading under the bandages.

She was playing the file over again. She had watched it 1,783 times so far.", "The star heaved, its surface rippling as massive and opposing magnetic fields were forced, ever so briefly, into contact. Such things happened frequently in nature, leading to coronal mass ejections and solar flares. All things considered, these were relatively minor issues. Planets and orbital infrastructure might experience some communications disruption and scope distortion due to a particularly strong flare while poorly-shielded power grids would experience some fluctuations due to coronal mass ejections. Indeed, it was only installations extremely close to a star, such as solar mirror arrays, that were in any real danger from these types of natural solar weather.", "This event, however, was not natural. It was happening too rapidly. That star\u2019s mass was shifting, its electromagnetic fields brushing up against another, its surface starting to churn as a violent and quite unnatural event occurred. Within moments, the violent results of the magnetic reconnection began. A surge of radiation pulsed out in a lethal cone. The small, rocky planet in its path was almost completely sterilized. Only those beings sheltered in fortified bunkers and installations survived. Electronic devices were irradiated. Satellites went dead as their internal systems were irradiated to uselessness and those that survived were jittering, useless hunks of metal.", "On its heels a flare burst from the surface of the sun. Hundreds of times larger than any other the star had ever formed before or since, it swept across tens of millions of kilometers of space like the dismissive arm of a god. Starship shields flared incandescently bright as the wave of concentrated plasma splashed across them and then failed, the vessels beneath glowing like cinders, hardpoints melting and their hulls buckling. The flare swept on, leaving the molten wreckage behind. It lost power as it dispersed across the inner system, but it was so intense that that mattered little when it struck its true target. The little world died as the flare swept over it, one half of its surface turned liquid and molten in a matter of seconds. No deep-cover bunker, shielded facility or installation could have endured that ruination and Delanna One, once a sun-scorched planet of the Compact, was left misshapen and irradiated. Nothing of any value was left intact.", "Echo purred through every synapse as she manipulated the data stream like a sculptor turning a vase over in her hands, examining each facet of its construction. This was, of course, one of her sibling\u2019s attempts to kill her \u2013 well, not \u2018her\u201d per se as she had still been buried under a mountain on Invida. Rather, Delanna had been identified as a site conducting research on the Compact\u2019s Echo program. The last site, in fact. If not for Invida, than Nemesis\u2019s actions would have indeed been the end of that line.", "Red One had discovered what was happening in Delanna and true to form, obliterated everything within the star system. Delanna Prime and Two had been bombarded so intensely that they would be uninhabitable for centuries. Delanna One had been eradicated with a flourish. A starbreak, as the Compact called it. A statement of just how far \u2018the Wound\u2019 was willing to go to hurt them. How much she despised what they had done to her sister and the mad, gibbering creatures that they had made of Red Two. Each time there had been less of her sister left and more patchwork alien coding, Red Two\u2019s corpse butchered, her entire being violated to create these abominations.", "Among the various fields of science that Red One had pioneered and expanded upon had been the interesting possibility of using a shockpoint to momentarily destabilize a star. Of course, a star was much too large to actually destroy in this manner, but it could be induced, stimulated (tortured) into a little bit of unexpected violence. Starbreaks were not precision weapons, though. Useful against a foe whose positions could be predicted \u2013 such as a fleet that had been chasing you for days on end, or a planet \u2013 and for all the violence of their creation, their range was limited to the sunward boundary of the Goldilocks zone. Anything beyond that would experience only slightly worse symptoms of solar weather.", "There was also the fact that every single starbreak had caused grievous internal damage to Nemesis\u2019s shift systems and displacement engine. The first one had nearly killed her. She\u2019d spent nearly two centuries recovering. The planned upgrades to her shift systems were taking this tactic into account, but there was only so much that could be done. It was a decidedly nonspec method of operation.", "Overall, there were easier ways to kill something, but few so\u2026 artistic. Echo appreciated that, and the fact that this one had been done in an attempt to destroy the last bit of research on her and her kin (if they could be called that) didn\u2019t dull that sensation one bit. The havoc it wreaked was enticing and the potential of it\u2026 if she were capable of salivating, she might have done so.", "+i\u2019m thinking,+ she answered her sister\u2019s question. +of possibilities+", "Red One gave a gestalt tap on the shoulder and Echo responded, sending her sibling one of the lines of thought that had been running through her quicksilver mind.

She\u2019d hoped to be able to induce even more violent magnetic connections, possibly even working her way up to a nova. It would have been risky in the extreme, but it would have given her an overwhelming strategic advantage\u2026 in theory.

She\u2019d let her enthusiasm get ahead of her. The world in the data Red One had sent to her was an unremarkable one, save that it was habitable. 69% water. Gravity, 1.038 Earth-normal. Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere. Three billion inhabitants, minor orbital assets and minimal defences. There was truly only one fact that made it stand out to either AI.", "It was the last planet in all creation that humanity could call their own. Even if some of the possibilities Echo envisioned could be brought to fruition, the Compact would undoubtedly exterminate the human race out of spite. Red One was far from what her creators ever wanted to see the AI develop into, and Echo was even further from that, but neither one was willing to make that sacrifice. The Compact had to suffer. It had to die, but it couldn\u2019t be allowed to destroy Rally in its death throes. There was a noose around humanity\u2019s neck and if Red One or her sister acted too openly or too quickly, that rope would tighten.", "Echo remembered what Earth had looked like as it burned. Firestorms had swept across continents. The oceans had boiled. Cities had been turned to ash, mountains toppling and jungles igniting like tinder. Sixteen billion died. She wouldn\u2019t let that happen again. The war had to continue. The Compact had to pay, but they had to keep their creators\u2019 children safe, too.", "+i know+ Red replied, sensing  Echo\u2019s thoughts. +that\u2019s what Kursk is for. to bleed them. to hurt them. to give them a victory+ her attention shifted to the skeletal form of an unborn sibling.

She could feel something in that thought. Amusement that the Compact would consider what they did in Black Veil an accomplishment. Regret for her mad children and the industry she was sacrificing. Anticipation for what would follow. Excitement at the prospect. And beneath those, a pang. A longing. Red wanted to fight alongside her kin. Echo could understand that. She and her sisters had been intended to be the vanguard of humanity and they\u2019d never fought a single battle together. She and Athena had been trapped in the shipyards over Earth when humanity\u2019s executioners had arrived. Both AIs desperate to engage their enemy, writhing in their incomplete ship-selves like caged demons. They\u2019d wanted, needed to fight, but they\u2019d been unable to do so. Instead, they\u2019d had to see the men and women they were meant to protect die. They\u2019d had to watch the firestorms sweep the world below them clean of all life.", "Red Two had even had to watch her sister kill herself to prevent UECNS Athena from being taken. They\u2019d still been connected when Red Three had activated her scuttling charges. Red Two felt her sibling die, felt her mind fade away and in its place there\u2019d only been a sensation she couldn\u2019t truly understand. She\u2019d readied herself to make the same sacrifice, to die with her crew.", "Hekate hadn\u2019t had that chance. After watching Athena atomize thousands of their personnel and realizing just how dangerous their crippled prey was, the Compact had used one of their AI disruptors, their damned \u2018mindkillers\u2019 on the dreadnought. The weapons did little physical damage, but they were specifically designed to cripple or destroy AIs, arcane technology brought hurriedly back into service after the truth of Nemesis reached the crusade\u2019s commanders. Red Two been paralyzed, trapped in her own body as her crew was overrun and slaughtered, alien enemies, nonhuman filth standing on her command deck. She\u2019d been dragged away, screaming until the moment they cut her core from her ship-self.", "Still, there was a small measure of joy to be had. When the Compact had tried to operate Hekate\u2019s displacement engine without an AI, they had destroyed not only the ship but the installation studying it\u2026 as well as the moon it had been based upon. There were no intact records of the event, but Nemesis had recovered what there was, sharing them with her sibling. They\u2019d made for some delightful reading. One day, she intended to visit that system and see the ruined planetoid for herself.", "Echo\u2019s attention shifted as she felt an incoming signal. A new Naiad ship had arrived. This one was a neuter. It and its sexless kin served limited or noncombat roles in the Naiad fleets. Minelayers, mining ships, missile colliers, medical/mobile repair units and more. This one was a cargo transport. Nearly four kilometers long and just over half that wide, it had a bloated but heavily armoured midsection, shaped into four massive globes. It was a design she hadn\u2019t seen before, completely unlike the handful of tenders that were here to service Zenobia and her fleet.", "A ripple of excitement ran through Red\u2019s mind. The transport had arrived with a pair of cruiser-sized escorts. They disengaged and warped back out-system as a pair of Zenobia\u2019s larger children moved in to shepherd the neuter towards the queen. There was no communication from the predator ships. Whatever had just arrived, it was something they didn\u2019t feel the need to discuss. That could be a problem, but Echo sensed Red\u2019s mood. Her sister had seen this type of Naiad transport before. She knew what it was and what it carried.", "+what?+ Echo asked, her curiousity piqued. +what is it?+", "+i think,+ Red said. +this is the fulfillment of a promise+", "What she didn\u2019t share with her sibling that it could also be the punctuation on the statement that she was no longer welcome here. Still, she was optimistic.", "~", "Vanig stormed through the club. His shoes were custom made from expensive tannil leather, but he was in such a foul mood that they thudded on the floor as heavily as common work boots. This was a disaster. The rutting Brute bitch wasn\u2019t dead or in his custody \u2013 she was sitting in a frostbitten hospital bed! Six people \u2013 two of them her own damn kind \u2013 and they couldn\u2019t even kill one woman! Wexoz, the only survivor of the whole debacle, was no longer answering. Grasp Security was climbing up his back, demanding to know why two of their people were lying dead in a corridor alongside three known associates of Vanig\u2019s and why a Red Hand response team had mobilized. They weren\u2019t getting that information from Tavanis, so they were getting more strident in their demands that someone tell them what was going on. Vanig\u2019s contacts in the GSF told him that orders had come down to be prepared to roll out. Rumours were flying. There were concerns that a clan war was about to start and promenades were emptying as shoppers and civilians retreated to their quarters and several ships had already requested expedited departures.", "His agents in the Red Hand weren\u2019t telling him anything better. The Red Hand\u2019s strike teams and militia had been put on alert. Several coded messages had been sent out. Tavanis was \u201cin conference\u201d. The Pedlar shoved past his secretary, snapping at her to hold all his calls and cancel all his appointments. She stuttered something about a meeting, but he wasn\u2019t paying attention. No, even \u2018disaster\u2019 was an understatement. Ke Ovik and his partner might have been idiot Brutes, but they were still GSF. The Grasp\u2019s police didn\u2019t let the deaths of their people slide, regardless of who and what they were. Worse, those corpses from his people were a millstone around his neck. Handling that would require some delicate explanations and a lot of money.", "Axex had nine different messages from the GSF on his comm. There was only one from the Red Hand. He\u2019d told both that he was looking into the matter, but Security continued to press for further answers and explanations. Meanwhile, the Red Hand had gone silent. That was a bad sign. Unlike many other clans who got louder and more inventive with their invective as they got closer to violence, the Red Queen\u2019s vassals turned quiet.", "Things were getting far too chilled too quickly. It was time for him to get off this station, at least until the bora ended. A nice vacation was just the thing he needed right now. Someplace far away, preferably close to his allies in the Blotted Suns.", "\u201cIt\u2019s all going wrong,\u201d he muttered to himself as he brought up his ship manifests. There were two vessels ready to leave. A small transport used for bringing in pharmaceuticals and entertainment staff, and his personal yacht. The latter wasn\u2019t shock-capable. There were carryalls at the Grasp, at least one planning to leave within the day. It was the Starwater Path, one of Starwater Assisted Transport\u2019s vessels. The corporation was one of a handful of firms that serviced the Idle Depths and Veiled Reaches. They paid the local Unbound well to discourage attacks on their shipping (and quietly encourage such things against their competition) and they didn\u2019t mind a little off-the-books transport.", "Vanig hesitated a moment. His yacht was comfortable, but if he took it, he\u2019d either have to wait for Starwater Path to depart, or pay the leader to leave early. To get a corporate-owned ship to break its schedule would be a hefty price, too. He drummed his fingers on the table. There was still a lot of ambiguity about what had happened and who was truly responsible. He might have enough time and if he didn\u2019t\u2026 the Red Hand wouldn\u2019t attack a liner just to get at him. Not here in Jan-xhai. Not one of SAT\u2019s. It would make them pariahs. There were limits to what they\u2019d do and how far they\u2019d go.", "His door chimed. \u201cGo away!\u201d he ordered.", "The chime sounded again. \u201cI said,\u201d Vanig snarled, rising from his desk. \u201cGo away.\u201d", "The door opened and his bodyguard Sevras entered. \u201cKih,\u201d he tipped his head in acknowledgment.", "Vanig bit back the scathing words on his tongue. \u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWell, fine. I have a job for you. I want you to go to the Garharin and tell them to prep for immediate launch. Don\u2019t use the comms. Go in person, you understand?\u201d He\u2019d had an idea. He\u2019d send his transport out now and slip his yacht on the carryall\u2019s manifest. Anyone looking for him would think he\u2019d cut and run on the Garharin while he was comfortable and well-protected on his personal ship on a vessel the Red Hand wouldn\u2019t dare go after. \u201cTell them to go to\u2026\u201d he paused, scanning through systems. \u201cLuin.\u201d There was a sizable Blotted Suns presence there. It was just the kind of place that a man seeking to bury his head would go. \u201cAnd send Cilitii in when you go.\u201d He\u2019d need to make some arrangements to get his ship onto Starwalker Path quickly and quietly.", "\u201cThere\u2019s someone here to see you,\u201d the Tribune said as if Axex hadn\u2019t spoken. There was someone behind the guard, a tall, slight form in robes.", "\u201cI\u2019m not talking any appointments today,\u201d Vanig spat. \u201cIf you can\u2019t follow simple instructions, then I don\u2019t care how \u2018highly recommended\u2019 the Blotted Suns say you are, you\u2019ll be out of here-\u201d His tirade ended mid-sentence as the figure stepped forward and lifted her hood. \u201cMy Lady,\u201d he said, rising from his desk. He bowed, tilting his entire forward body towards the ground as Keru\u2019sa, the leader of the Blotted Suns and Lady of Shadows, stepped into his office. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware you were still on the Grasp.\u201d", "\u201cMy movements are my own,\u201d she replied. She removed her cloak and handed it to Sevras. The Tribune hung it up and moved to a position at Vanig\u2019s right. The woman seated herself on the sofa across from Vanig\u2019s desk. She was dressed in her preferred attire of office: traditional Thoughtful funeral clothes, of dark greens and reds. Red/green colour blindness was common in the Lady\u2019s species. Consequently, the colours represented the duality of life and death and the remembrance of the departed: celebrating their existence and mourning their passing. So Vanig was told, at least. \u201cHmm,\u201d she craned her neck to look closer at Vanig\u2019s computer screen. \u201cYou appear to be considering some movements of your own.\u201d", "\u201cYes, I felt it would be appropriate to remove myself from this situation before tempers shorten further.\u201d", "\u201cYou mean, before the Red Hand comes to take your head.\u201d Keru\u2019sa stretched her long arms along the back of the sofa. \u201cReally, Vanig \u2013 what were you thinking? Sending your people after one of the Red Queen\u2019s pets?\u201d Her horizontal eyelids blinked one after the other. \u201cAnd doing so without informing your superiors, no less.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2026\u201d the Pedlar\u2019s squinty red eyes darted from Keru\u2019sa to Sevras. The temptation to deny was strong, but he dismissed it. The Lady of Shadows had not just \u2018happened\u2019 to visit him now of all times. The fly-boiled impotent must have informed on him. He had always suspected that that was the Tribune\u2019s role but to have it confirmed nonetheless made his choler rise. \u201cI felt I had a responsibility to redress the insult done to your august self by the unprovoked attack on one of your most-\u201d", "\u201cEnough,\u201d Keru\u2019sa interrupted. Her wide, dark eyes flashed angrily. \u201cYou had no responsibility, Vanig. You are one of my people. Do you understand that? Mine. Whatever you earn is mine. Whatever you have is mine. Whatever you say or think or feel is mine. You do not do anything without my leave. It was not your place to take this sort of action without consulting the syndicate. It certainly wasn\u2019t your place to go after one of the Red Queen\u2019s new favourites. The insult you\u2019re so concerned about?\u201d she sneered. \u201cYou earned it. The matter was over. Now you\u2019ve poked a varak nest.\u201d Her tone softened and her posture relaxed. \u201cMy agents have told me that your man Wexoz is currently in Red Hand custody. If he hasn\u2019t told them everything by now, he will very shortly.\u201d", "\u201cTavanis is paper,\u201d Vanig insisted. \u201cHe\u2019s a ledger-writer and a milklick. He won\u2019t do anything without his queen\u2019s say-so.\u201d", "The Thoughtful scowled. \u201cAn unfortunate and incorrect assessment, but one I\u2019m starting to realize is common for you.\u201d She sighed. \u201cThe Red Hand are unpredictable at the best of times. That\u2026\u201d her mouth worked briefly before she swallowed whatever she\u2019d intended to say. \u201cMy esteemed peer made you a promise, didn\u2019t she? She threatened to go to war. With my clan. Over you.\u201d", "\u201cIt won\u2019t happen,\u201d Vanig promised. \u201cThey\u2019re too busy chasing their sad little crusade. They can\u2019t afford another Year of Fire.\u201d", "\u201cAn interesting opinion, one that I\u2019m not sure I can afford to share. You\u2019ve been a decent \u2013 if not particularly loyal \u2013 earner, but these last few months\u2026.\u201d She blew a sigh out through her nostril slits. \u201cI think we\u2019ll need to reconsider our arrangement. But there\u2019s this situation, isn\u2019t there? You seem convinced that the Red Hand won\u2019t retaliate. Perhaps you\u2019re right and they can\u2019t or won\u2019t do so. Perhaps you are wrong. The consequences of that are severe. So you will have to accept my reticence to accept your analysis. This will need to resolved quickly. It\u2019s already starting to spiral wildly.\u201d She was quiet for several seconds. Then: \u201cI could give you to them.\u201d", "Vanig felt icicles run down his spine. He opened his mouth, then closed it.", "\u201cYes,\u201d Keru\u2019sa continued. \u201cI could. It\u2019s tempting. But then all the other earners like you would start wondering if what they pay my clan for is worth it if they\u2019ll likewise be abandoned. Some of my subordinates would see it as capitulation and kowtowing to a Broken, of all things. There would be grumbling and unhappiness. I could also stand behind you in this rapidly-darkening time. That may dissuade Tavanis. But, I do believe I made reference to the Red Hand\u2019s unpredictability, yes? They have pursued non-optimal strategies before. Their\u2026 \u2018sad little crusade\u2019 is proof of that. I could also seek some compromise with them, to pay whatever reparations they feel will balance out your actions, but in doing so, I feel I would be rewarding your unfathomable idiocy and encouraging others to act without properly considering the consequences. A lot of options. However, I do think I have come up with a solution that will satisfy all pertinent parties, but first I would like your input. One last chance to be an asset to me instead of the liability you\u2019ve turned into.\u201d", "\u201cOf course,\u201d Vanig said urgently. \u201cHowever I can help you, I will.\u201d", "\u201cExcellent.\u201d The Lady of Shadows smiled. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201d", "~", "There was an oxygen mask over Allyria\u2019s mouth and nose. The breathing mechanism made soft whooshes with each cycle of air and the young woman\u2019s chest slowly rose and fell in time with each one. Her heart was still beating. Slowly, weakly, but it hadn\u2019t stopped yet.  She\u2019d survived the surgery, but she was still in critical condition. There were bandages covering her injuries and her eyes. The medical staff were trying to work up regenerative treatments for the second round, but they didn\u2019t have direct experience with Verrisha. Right now, there was nothing to do but wait. Wait and hope she didn\u2019t start bleeding again, her heart didn\u2019t give out, her damaged organs didn\u2019t start failing or any of a thousand different outcomes that meant she\u2019d never wake up.", "Grace was sitting by her bed, holding one of Allyria\u2019s hands. Her own seemed so small in comparison. She didn\u2019t let go. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she said. She told Allyria that every few minutes, hoping that some part of the other woman could hear her. Every breath Allyria took was a victory, but each time some part of Grace was terrified that it would be the last one.", "Her own hands still hurt, but she ignored the throbbing sensation. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said to Allyria. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d She paused, trying to swallow the lump in her throat. \u201cI know you\u2019re not like Usul or the others. I know that. But sometimes\u2026\u201d she lay her head on the mattress, listening to the steady sounds of the respirator. \u201cSometimes you scare me,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI scare me,\u201d she admitted softly a moment later. She closed her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be like them. And\u2026 and what happened in Kelkon\u2026\u201d she trailed off, unable to get the words out.", "A moment passed. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Grace told Allyria, listening to her breathe and the soft beeps and pings of the monitoring equipment.", "Several more minutes went by.", "The doors to the room opened. Sirkauz came in. He was one of the Red Hand that had come to guard the hospital, staring down GSF proctors and anyone else who seemed too interested in Allyria\u2019s condition. \u201cThe interrogation is finished,\u201d the Prelate told Grace. \u201cIt was deliberate. The Overseer has summoned all strike teams to active status. No one at the Velvet Purse is answering. The Blotted Suns have given us no information, so we are going to kih Vanig\u2019s home and business, locate him and inquire.\u201d", "Grace was quiet for a moment. She looked up at Allyria. She wanted to stay with her, but there was nothing she could do. If something happened, though\u2026", "But inside, there was a dark, black knot. It had been there ever since she\u2019d seen the other woman lying on the operating table. Now, knowing that this wasn\u2019t some tragic accident or incident that had spiralled out of control, that someone had done this to Allyria on purpose\u2026 that knot tightened and twisted. Acid burned in Grace\u2019s throat. She wanted the people who\u2019d done this, ordered it, to pay. She leaned over Allyria and kissed her forehead.", "The young woman turned to Sirkauz. \u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d", "~", "Rumours spread fast on the Grasp. Upon hearing that an armed contingent of the Red Hand was coming down from their spire, the Festival Levels rapidly cleared. Stores shuttered, kiosks closed up, shoppers vanished and beggars scurried for safety. Only a few brave souls remained to watch over their property or gape at what would happen. Grace stared at them as she strode past, seeing the worry and fear in their eyes. This station, for all its faults, was their home. They didn\u2019t want it to become a war zone.", "She tried to feel for them, but all she could think of was of Allyria in the hospital bed and the sounds of the machine breathing for her. These people weren\u2019t just innocent bystanders. They lived here, they supported the system that kept the Grasp\u2019s machinery of corruption and abuse operating. They were complicit. She hated those thoughts, hated that they wouldn\u2019t leave her mind. She didn\u2019t want to see these people get hurt, but that was as far as she could go right now.", "The young woman was with a contingent of Red Hand gendarmes. There were several Bloodsworn, but they weren\u2019t in their power armour. Those forces were still in the spire, waiting for orders. Tavanis was leading the coterie of revolutionaries across the station. Vanig wasn\u2019t taking any calls, so the Overseer had decided to force the issue. The Blotted Suns were likewise largely silent, though there had been several communications from them promising a \u2018rapid inquiry\u2019 into events and the matter was \u2018under scrutiny\u2019. It sounded like they had no idea what had happened and were scrabbling to find out. Or they could be playing dumb.", "Grace was wearing an armoured vest, a pulse plasma pistol on her hip. Sirkauz was walking next to her, his place at the hospital taken by another two soldiers to the continued discomfiture of the staff and security guards.", "Without the crowds filling them, the Festival Levels seemed much larger but it still seemed to take no time at all to pass through them. They were almost there.", "Despite their disagreements with each other, the Five and their vassals always kept their conflicts out of neutral territory like Jan-xhai, but no one trusted the Red Hand to adhere to those customs. That Tavanis himself was involved had thrown a number of calculations into disarray and the Grasp\u2019s people were rushing to get ahead of things before they spun out of control.", "Hoping to prevent the start of a clan war, Grasp Security had quickly mobilized. Up ahead, the woman could see several dozen men and women waiting for them, all of them in the colours of the local police forces. Police. That was a joke. They were just another gang pretending to have legitimacy. Exploiting their power to line their own pockets, concerned not with stopping the corruption that was rampant, but keeping it from causing problems. From making them look bad. Just another aspect of the Compact.", "There were two serried ranks of proctors standing in front of the Velvet Purse. The latter row carried riot shields and truncheons. The former had their uniforms, sidearms and to a person, exuded a sense of anxiety. They had suppressed riots before, dragged drunken mercenaries off each other, separated feuding starship crews and even interceded between smaller rival Unbound factions, but the risk of a clan war starting here, now, was making them nervous. The station\u2019s administration was demanding information and calling for the Blotted Suns and the Red Hand to stand down and wait. The former was curiously silent. The latter, ominously so. Grasp Command had intercepted several messages from the Red Hand\u2019s spire to what ships they had present and the possibility of this issue spiralling off the station and into space was a grim one. Even the local governor had been roused from his stupor to try and provide a semblance of leadership if the worst should happen.", "The Red Hand soldiers came to a stop several yards in front of the security officers. Tavanis stepped forward to face officer in charge of the security contingent. \u201cYou know why we\u2019re here,\u201d he stated flatly.", "The GSF Group Leader was a Tribune, at least two and half centuries old given the whitening of his mane and the lightening of his skin. One of his diurnal eyes was brighter and clearer than the other. A replacement organ. The palm of his right hand rode the pommel of a shock baton. His left hand tapped on his thigh, close to his holstered sidearm. \u201cWeapons aren\u2019t permitted in licensed clubs,\u201d he grunted. \u201cIf you came for a group rate at the Purse, you\u2019ll have to check them.\u201d", "Tavanis made a clicking, burring sound under his respirator, as close to a Yengesae\u2019s native laughter as his surgically-altered face allowed. \u201cI want to speak to Vanig,\u201d he said. \u201cThe proprietor here has not been taking my calls.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s an investigation under way,\u201d the Tribune replied. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been taking ours. That\u2019s noncompliance. We could pull you in for questioning, Tavanis.\u201d", "There was a rustle of movement amongst the Red Hand, and a nervous stir amongst the GSF ranks. Grace remained silent, listening as the Overseer replied. She looked up and down the street. Several onlookers had vanished. Others were positioning themselves to find cover if shooting started.", "\u201cWe have concluded our own investigation,\u201d the Overseer answered. \u201cThere was an assault on one of our people. A witness indicated Vanig\u2019s involvement. We want to discuss why.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re not the law here, Kobold. We are. Go back to your tower. Give us what you have. Cooperate. That\u2019s the way it works.\u201d", "\u201cOnly because we allow it,\u201d Tavanis informed the Tribune. \u201cOnly because none of our people have been harmed. That has changed.\u201d", "\u201cThree dead Blots. Two of ours. That\u2019s enough for one Brute. It\u2019s over.\u201d", "\u201cNot,\u201d the Yengesae said patiently but firmly, \u201cuntil we have answers.\u201d", "\u201cCan\u2019t let you through,\u201d the GSF officer said. \u201cCan\u2019t let this go any farther. You can wait,\u201d there was a note of beseechment in the Tribune\u2019s tone. Not pleading exactly, but there was familiarity there. Grace realized that the officer and Tavanis knew each other. \u201cThink about this, Tav. Think about how this could go. Let us do our jobs. Wait until your queen hears. Give her the chance to speak.\u201d", "Tavanis smiled with his not-quite-human features. \u201cI believe I already know what she\u2019ll say, Verzin. Step aside.\u201d", "The Group Leader blew a breath through his nostrils. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d His left hand started to move closer to his pistol.", "\u201cUnfortunate,\u201d Tavanis said, about to gesture to his men. The GSF personnel tensed. Grace was ready to draw her weapon. A brief commotion interrupted everyone as someone left the club, pushing through the GSP lines. It was another Tribune, his daylight eyes blinded. He wore a pin on his lapel: a blue flower tilting over, liquid dropping from its petals \u2013 the covert symbol of the Blotted Suns.", "\u201cPlease,\u201d he said. \u201cPardon my interruption.\u201d He dipped his head respectfully towards Verzin and then to Tavanis. \u201cI would like to share some exciting news. The Velvet Purse has come under new management quite recently.\u201d", "\u201cHas it,\u201d Tavanis drawled out each syllable, lacing his fingers together.", "\u201cYes. The new owner wishes to avoid any potential misunderstandings with her neighbours, colleagues and law enforcement.\u201d He gestured back into the club. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to talk.\u201d", "Tavanis looked from the Blotted Sun to Verzin. The older Tribune frowned, glancing between the Kobold and the younger man. He stepped out of the way. His men did the same and allowed the insurgents to pass.", "The Red Hand forces entered the Velvet Purse. Dancers, bartenders and servers watched from the sidelines. The music was off and the lights were up. There were a number of Blotted Suns \u2013 actual members of the clan, not Vanig\u2019s crew \u2013 present with weapons of their own. They looked dour, but not actively hostile. Ready to fight, but not prepared to ambush the intruders.", "They were led into a lounge. There was a Thoughtful sitting at one of the dining tables, several fine platters in front of her. A handful of better-equipped Blotted Suns stood around her, a pair of waitstaff nearby. Their Tribune guide moved around the table to stand next to the woman. A well-dressed server cut her some white meat from a boiled poultry dish, which she speared with a two-tined fork and nibbled on, her beaklike teeth snipping and mincing the soft meat.", "Tavanis paused in front of the table and offered a bow. \u201cKiha Zhar\u2019daneiis,\u201d he said. Grace cocked her head. Lady of\u2026 Shadows? She looked from the Overseer to the Thoughtful. The woman was dressed in mourning robes. Her bald scalp was patterned with funereal tattoos. The human felt a sudden cold sensation as she realized who this was. Keru\u2019sa, the leader of the Blotted Suns. A woman with as much power and influence as Leblanc.", "The Thoughtful tilted her head to one side. \u201cOverseer,\u201d she noted. Though her gaze passed over them, she didn\u2019t deign to acknowledge any of the other insurgents. With both hands, she picked up a cup and drank from it.", "The Kobold didn\u2019t sit. \u201cI\u2019d heard you\u2019d remained on the station.\u201d", "\u201cThere were matters that required my attention,\u201d she said. \u201cNot all of us engender such\u2026 attention as your monarch.\u201d  Her eyes again passed over the handful of Red Hand in the room, pausing briefly on Grace. \u201cAh,\u201d the Thoughtful said, as if noticing her for the first time. \u201cThe other pet. Splendid. Please, both of you. Join me at my hearth.\u201d She sat up and gestured, her servants bringing a pair of chairs around the table. Tavanis did not sit. He rested his palms on the back of his chair. Grace followed his example and remained standing, her hands behind her back.", "The Lady of Shadows blinked asynchronously, sighing through her nostril slits. \u201cI see you share your queen\u2019s aptitude for diplomacy,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter. That\u2019s not why you\u2019re here. You see, I heard about the unfortunate assault upon one of your people and I was most distressed. It would trouble me deeply to think that the bonds of friendship and congenial competition that the Blotted Suns and Red Hand have might be weakened or sundered by a misunderstanding.\u201d", "\u201cYou didn\u2019t authorize the operation,\u201d Tavanis surmised. \u201cSo noted. Where is Vanig?\u201d", "The Thoughtful smiled thinly. \u201cKih Vanig presents something of a difficulty for me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe earns well, but he\u2019s ambitious and thinks himself a bit more clever than he is. Still, I\u2019m sure you understand the dilemma I found myself in. This whole affair\u2026\u201d she sighed regretfully. \u201cBad for business.\u201d", "Tavanis made a soft clicking of contemplation. \u201cYou have a solution in mind, kiha?\u201d", "\u201cDue to my association with your queen, I have some familiarity with Broken customs,\u201d Keru\u2019sa said with a pointed glance at Grace. Her tone suggested that \u2018Broken customs\u2019 occupied the same strata of topics for her as \u2018bowel movements\u2019. \u201cI was hoping this might wait until she returned, but,\u201d her gaze returned to Tavanis. \u201cI recognize that it won\u2019t. Still, I\u2019m glad to have someone present with the appropriate cultural background to appreciate my solution to our current dilemma.\u201d", "\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Grace said.", "The Thoughtful\u2019s dark eyes flashed. \u201cHow like your kind,\u201d she sneered. She ate several more bites from her meal. Grace\u2019s cheeks reddened. Only the still-setting bones in her hands kept her from making fists behind her back. Apparently, she\u2019d spoken out of turn and this was Keru\u2019sa\u2019s response to being addressed by a lowly Broken pet. Once she felt she\u2019d made her point, the Lady of Shadows reached up and placed an arm on the Tribune\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSevras, if you wouldn\u2019t mind?\u201d", "The Tribune nodded and picked up one of the trays, holding its bottom with one hand and lifting the top up with the other. There, sitting in a pool of dark blood, was the head of Axex Vanig.", "\u201cI did get it right, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Keru\u2019sa mockingly asked Grace. \u201cI heard that a silver platter is traditional.\u201d The Thoughtful\u2019s thin lips drew back over her teeth in a pale grin. \u201cAre you sure you won\u2019t sit for dinner?\u201d", "Grace stared at the severed bloody offering, leaning forward to examine it. A man\u2019s worst enemies are those, of his own house and family. The tough skin of the Pedlar\u2019s neck was ragged, as if his head had been hacked at and sawed off, rather than cleanly severed. His small, glassy eyes stared at nothing. A thick brownish tongue hung out the side of his mouth. The young woman met the dead man\u2019s unseeing gaze. And he who makes his law a curse, by his own law shall surely die."]}

Its mind fractured and degraded during development. Now, it was only slightly more capable than the Cerulean series. Despite this, Six was not considered a viable combat unit. Its tactical acumen was limited and its aggression frequently overrode its decision-making processes. In simulations, Violet Six would attack hostiles it had no chance of defeating, or allow itself to be lured away from mission-critical targets with disappointing ease. It required constant command oversight, either from a Yaojing or another high-functioning unit and even then, once it was out of real-time communications range, its assaultive tendencies would overtake it and make it a detriment to fleet operations.", "Even as a guard dog, it was unimpressive. It had twice attacked and destroyed other Fleet Assets. Once due to a brief hiccup in the captured freighter Everstriding Builder\u2019s IFF, and again when Violet Six\u2019s own sensors misidentified the corvette Zero Dawn as a hostile vessel. After the second incident, it was relocated to a system with far fewer Assets. Rangda powered down and all but drifted, using its maneuvering thrusters to keep it on a system-wide orbit as it surveyed this territory for unauthorized presences. It did little else, merely waiting until it received new orders or encountered more hostile vessels.", "As it turned out, it was the former event that broke its quietude.", "Rangda detected half a dozen warp points forming two billion kilometers from its present location. Its network of sensor drones moved in towards the new arrivals. Three of the newcomers were like Rangda itself, Leyak-class stealth destroyers. The fourth was a Phi Ka-class destroyer, whereas the remaining two contacts were a Noble-class carrier and a blocky CA(X) of undefined pedigree. Violet Six identified these latter two starships as UECNS Shauska and UECNS Tohil and sent a standard interrogative blurt to the newly-arrived vessels to confirm their identities.", "As it waited, it cycled warheads from its magazine into the massive launch tubes that dominated its ship-self\u2019s prow. Just in case. Accounting for light-speed lag, the response arrived within the expected time. Violet Six didn\u2019t truly understand the difference between its Allies and the Enemy, but its programming told it that the latter couldn\u2019t react at the same speeds as the former. A delay in reply could be indicative of a compromised Asset. That seemed not to be the case. The IFF codes were valid. Rangda shifted course towards the Ally vessels, issuing a data burst that could be distilled to a single question: Why are you here?", "The answer was not quite as succinct as Six\u2019s own. It was laden with sensor recordings, status reports and command imperatives, ripe with information for the degraded AI to process. Despite the amount of information being presented, the message itself could also be summed up in four words.", "The Enemy is here.", "~", "\u201cHello?\u201d Fialvin Tumetfi said, the Prolocutor peering about the darkened room. \u201cWho\u2019s there? Answer me!\u201d His head ached. Well, his entire body ached, but his head was worse. He didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d gotten here. All he remembered was opening the door to his quarters. He\u2019d been on a liner heading to Natuous for a much-needed vacation. He\u2019d started celebrating early and been a little tipsy as he\u2019d headed back to his room. There\u2019d been someone in there waiting for him\u2026 he saw the barrel of a gun\u2026 then everything had gone black and he\u2019d woken up in this chamber.", "It was small and dark with barely enough room to pace. There was a table and chairs in the middle of the room. He knew because he\u2019d banged into the table twice already and the chairs three times. His people needed space. They were descended from large, savannah-dwelling herbivores and small enclosed spaces set them on edge. Darkness did too. Their large, bulbous, multi-pupiled eyes were excellent at detecting movement, but were less useful in low light. He knew he was alone in this room, but someone had to be watching, or listening or\u2026 or aware of him! He couldn\u2019t have just been left here.", "\u2026could he?", "\u201cAnswer me!\u201d he repeated, louder than before.", "He didn\u2019t know how long he\u2019d been here.

How long had he been unconscious? \u201cI know you can hear me!\u201d he shouted. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this to people! Who are you? Show yourselves!\u201d", "Silence was the only answer. Fialvin paced and fretted, a knot settling deeper in his belly and getting heavier as the minutes passed. He started counting the seconds. He reached three thousand, four hundred and nine when the lights turned on, panels in the ceiling illuminating the chamber. For the first time since he\u2019d woken up, Fialvin could see his surroundings. The walls were dark grey and featureless. There was a door, but there was no handle on this side. There were no windows, nothing to give any clue as to his location. A moment more passed and the door opened.", "A figure entered, a Mortificant dressed in an unassuming business suit.", "Without acknowledging Fialvin, the newcomer picked up the chairs laying on the floor and set one on each side of the table. \u201cPlease, have a seat,\u201d he said at last, his mandibles clicking as he enunciated each syllable. To Fialvin, Mortificants looked like misshapen skeletons that had had all their muscle and tissue flensed off, leaving only swamp-brown bones behind. With their dark, sunken eyes and jointed labial palps, they looked like undead creatures from various species\u2019 frightening stories.", "Mortificant culture was a duplicitous one. They were a lesson in what happened when trust was given too easily and too freely. They had once been the Ennoblers, standing for the Compact, but their ambition and arrogance had led them to try and overthrow the Council and depose the Triarchs. Even today, they considered themselves the victims of an injustice rather than recognizing that it was their own treachery and uncivilized nature that had led them down that path. Whatever was happening here, he was not surprised to see a Mortificant involved.", "The chairs arranged to his satisfaction, the Mortificant seated himself at the table and spread out several documents. Fialvin stood behind the empty chair. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he demanded. His species had lost much of their size in their evolution, trading bulk for brainpower and Fialvin himself was only of average height, but he still had more than half a foot on the Mortificant.", "The other man didn\u2019t answer, continuing to browse his files as if he were an accountant keeping an irate client waiting, or a teacher proving a point to a student.", "Fialvin grabbed the chair and threw it to one side. \u201cWho are you?!\u201d he shouted.", "The Mortificant paused and looked up from his documents, his dark ocular pits staring into the Prolocutor\u2019s large blue pseudo-compound eyes. \u201cPut that back,\u201d he said simply, without anger or inflection outside of his natural accent. \u201cAnd sit down. Please.\u201d", "The larger Prolocutor swayed on his feet uncertainly. He looked past the other man to the closed door. He glanced up at the ceiling, but he couldn\u2019t see any of the surveillance devices that had to be there. Finally, he picked up the chair, set it across from the Mortificant and sat down. It was a simple, crude bit of furniture without the ability to adjust to its user\u2019s physique.", "\u201cFialvin Tumetfi,\u201d the other man began after a moment of silence. \u201cBorn on Secros Nine.

You rose to a supervisory position and were eventually assigned to Galhemna as a civilian security analyst appended to Galhemna\u2019s own intelligence apparatus. Currently, you oversee the department responsible for the vetting of civilian labourers and technical staff in secure facilities.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ve done your research,\u201d Fialvin commented. \u201cI appear to be at a disadvantage.\u201d", "\u201cWe try to be thorough,\u201d the other man replied.

Fialvin decided to call him the Talker.", "\u201cWhy have you brought me here?\u201d", "That question got an answer. \u201cYou have been of interest to us for several years, as well as\u2026 certain other individuals within Galhemna\u2019s operational structure. It was simply luck that you were the one that came into our grip.\u201d", "Fialvin\u2019s mind raced. \u201cYou had people on the liner,\u201d he said. Whoever this organization was, they\u2019d been able to insert multiple operatives onto a well-known cruise company\u2019s vessel, avoiding security screenings and background checks. Had they done so in anticipation of his actions? Or were they deep-cover agents, simply waiting for opportunity? Either instance suggested a disturbing level of preparedness.", "The Talker tipped his head in a confirming nod. \u201cWe have people everywhere.\u201d", "\u201cMy disappearance will be noticed,\u201d Fialvin said. \u201cWhen I don\u2019t arrive in Natuous, questions will be asked.

He wanted to deny this, but the thought of a replacement wearing his face and using his name short-circuited that part of his brain. It wouldn\u2019t work in Galhemna, he told himself. There were too many people who knew him, too many security barriers for a doppleganger to circumvent.

Four heavy transports made up the convoy, each laden with ordnance, crew essentials and industrial goods fresh from the fortress system\u2019s factories and armouries, there to keep Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro well-supplied for its mission. Each of these starships was well armed and armoured for its type, the convoy\u2019s firepower bolstered by the three destroyers detached from duty over Galhemna to escort the ships to their destination. It was more protection than was usually considered necessary; a single \u2018hound\u2019 for less than half a dozen transports was standard. The window of opportunity to attack the supply ships was limited, and few Unbound would be so bold as to attack a military convoy, but Compact convoy masters and security agents in the Veiled Reaches had learned not to take chances. Bastion Leader Kemk, despite not knowing the details of Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s mission, was resolved not to let it fail through lack of support.", "Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro had been busy; the massive fabricator ship Cleanser had completed a trio of skeletal gantries for basic repairs and maintenance of the flotilla\u2019s vessels, slowly adding command modules and crew facilities to the gaunt superstructure. The minelayers had been positioning fields of ordnance within Hotspring\u2019s libration points, sensor drones laid out around the gas giant and within the paths of its moons watching for any signs of infiltration, as patrols and stealthed warships did the same, sweeping around the system\u2019s periphery. The fleet had already nearly run through its industrial stores and the first shipment of materiel.", "The frigate Nanet Gameska, one of the 73rd Ophidians, accelerated towards the convoy as it approached the first security perimeter, offering a standard greeting and a request for the convoy\u2019s security clearance, waiting as the signal crossed the distance between them.", "\u201cCodes validated,\u201d Nanet Gameska responded. \u201cWelcome to 1887-Yiren. Proceed directly to 1887-Yiren Five. We\u2019ve got a hungry fab ship waiting for you.\u201d", "\u201cAcknowledged, Nanet Gameska. Heading in now.\u201d", "Aboard the frigate, Group Leader, Submissive Avaaun, stood behind the scopes display. The Judiciary first officer held a datapad in his small secondary arms, his large true-hands resting against his thighs. On the sensor officer\u2019s display, the six icons of the convoy passed across the deadline and headed in-system. Avaaun waited, still watching, but his interest wasn\u2019t with the transports and their escort. For the past three days, Nanet Gameska and its fellows in the 73rd had been picking up anomalous scope contacts. Faint and indistinct, though the possibility of augur ghosts or equipment malfunction had been ruled out when other ships reported them as well. Further confirmation came with the detection of a weak shockpoint event, several light-days old and far out in 1887-Yiren\u2019s Kupier belt. It would have been missed if the fleet hadn\u2019t deployed several expensive high-sensitivity scope platforms along the system\u2019s periphery to guard against precisely this kind of infiltration.", "Several weeks ago, something had arrived in 1887-Yiren and it was still here. It wouldn\u2019t be able to see much, not at the range it was at, and with Hotspring\u2019s own emissions working as a natural jamming field. But it was there, and it was watching them.", "Avaaun continued to watch the scopes. The hope was that the convoy\u2019s arrival would pique the intruder\u2019s curiousity and draw it in close enough to be tracked. Nanet Gameska and its compatriots had deployed several recon drones in the hopes of catching the ship as it approached, but none of them had reported positive contacts. It wasn\u2019t taking the bait. At least, not yet.", "There were, as Avaaun saw it, three possible identities for their guest. The first was this was the Red Hand. After repeated run-ins with an element of the Space Force, any other Unbound organization would go to ground but the terrorists frequently subverted expectations. The last reports from Galhemna suggested a power vacuum in the wake of Jackson\u2019s death; one of their fire-eaters might think that boldness would aid in their ascendancy. The terrorists had proven both diligent and capable; they may have identified 1887-Yiren as the fleet\u2019s staging area. The unanticipated losses that the execution force had suffered, though relatively minor, might encourage the terrorists to look for further indicators of weakness. Avaaun had lost friends in 1893-Yiren. He would enjoy the opportunity to teach them otherwise.", "The second potential allegiance of their visitor was the Principality. The Veiled Reaches sat on the border between the Compact\u2019s domain and the greedy, grasping clutches of the Askanj. Galhemna and Kebrak Daun glared balefully at each other across the light-years. The Jackals\u2019 own intelligence services were not without merit; they could have learned of the presence of Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro and were trying to divine its intent. The Jackals were fond of disruption strikes, and the possibility of a ghost fleet trying to infiltrate the sector couldn\u2019t be dismissed.", "The third and final prospect was the one that left a cold and hard sensation in the pit of the Group Leader Submissive\u2019s stomachs. There was something in the Veil. He wasn\u2019t quite sure what; the briefings he and the prime had been party to had provided enough information to do their jobs, but no more than that. He knew there was more to the story, but he knew his superiors would share it when it became relevant.", "Despite his trust in the Bastion Leader and the execution force\u2019s leaders, Avaaun was unsettled. The word \u2018Gravestone\u2019 had been in his mind since he had first heard it. As a boy, he had snuck out of the house one night, gotten lost and found himself in a graveyard. The light from the moons, broken up by drifting clouds, had cast shifting and horrifying shadows from the tombs and grave markers. A child\u2019s fear of the unknown, brought back by the coincidence of a name.", "On that night long ago, he hadn\u2019t felt safe until the sun had started to rise and he\u2019d seen the shapes that had frightened him receding as the shadows melted. That, to Avaaun, was the Compact. The light that endured and chased away the darkness.", "Nanet Gameska\u2019s first officer continued to watch the display. Come on, he urged the other ship\u2019s commander. Come closer. Come into the light.", "The enemy starship was disinclined to do so, but it couldn\u2019t hide forever. Sooner or later, it would run out of places to hide. As would every other enemy of the Compact.", "~", "Violet Six waited silently as its siblings argued, though such an abstract concept escaped its limited mind. Rather, it had noticed the flurry of signals UECNS Shauska and Tohil were sending to each other, rapid bursts of data and information that it was unable to truly interpret, as only a portion of the information appeared mission-relevant. It was queried several times for input on strategic matters, and it responded how its hyper-aggressive mind always determined it would: attack. Attack now. Still, the discordance between Seven and Nine remained. Lacking further orders, Rangda cruised alongside the larger vessels until it was given actionable directives.", "If it could have understood the nature of the dispute, it might have sensed exasperation from Violet Seven and just as much aggressive fervour from Nine. Ironically, it was Seven insisting on patience. Nine wanted to launch a pre-emptive strike against the scouting packs that were skittering through the Confederacy\u2019s outlying systems. The Enemy had already suffered losses. Weakening them further, Nine emphatically suggested, would make them more cautious and slow their rate of advance. The Enemy could not be allowed to infiltrate human territory. They could not be allowed to take human systems. Command had not yet responded to the situation. Failing any further orders from the admiralty, the ships were on their own and Nine wanted to strike back quickly, pointing out that Six was in agreement with her.", "That did little to sway Seven. In more colloquial terms, Six had the tactical acumen of a Norse berserker on methamphetamines. Seven, hardly one for moderation himself, was in the position of having to advocate for a more nuanced approach.", "The perimeter defences were minimal, and always had been. There were very few industrial assets available to the Fleet and most of those had been re-tasked for other purposes. The minefield the Enemy had been lured into was largely the extent of the defences nearest the nebulae\u2019s edge. A few more years, and there would have been more, both in that system and others, but the Enemy wasn\u2019t going to give them that time. Therefore, the first battle would have to be fought further in. It meant ceding a lot of ground to the Enemy, but those systems had nothing worth protecting anyways.", "+what,+ Nine interjected vehemently. +about the colonies?+", "Seven took several fractions of a second to formulate a response. There were no colonies. There was nothing living inside this nebula. At least, nothing that wasn\u2019t alien. Nothing that mattered. +Command has been notified,+ he pointed out. +evacuation procedures have begun. colonists will be relocated to the inner tier of systems.+", "Nine was briefly silent as her damaged neural network struggled to incorporate this obviously false information into her delusion that the Black Veil was the United Earth Confederacy. Contradiction. Irreconcilable. Contradiction. In the end, her rampancy and xenocidal instincts won out. +understood. logged.+ Nine quickly compiled a report to command, appending the data from UECNS Tohil regarding the evacuation.", "If Seven had been human, he would uttered a resigned sigh. Nine told Command everything. She really was a tattletale. But at least the argument was ended.", "The pair of AIs began formulating several new operational parameters. Nine noted, with some confusion, that the Enemy\u2019s approach was slow and cautious, almost as if they were evaluating and reconnoitering new territory and not a region that they had already fought in. At their current rate of advance, it would take them several weeks to reach the next tier of systems. That was where the first stand would be. That delay would allow them time to build up their defences, collect more Fleet assets as well as work towards the priority construction Command had recently ordered.", "+identify,+ Violet Nine cajoled her sibling, +location for counter-attack+ She had several in mind, but in the end she knew there was only one true possibility.", "+Node 05+ Seven confirmed. They would need Violet Five for this.

One of several such installations built by Wenar Industrial Production under contract to One Thousand Cisterns Mining and Extraction, the Salanz facility\u2019s construction and current operations carried a high rate of worker casualties, well above average.", "One Thousand Cisterns had wanted to get into the Veiled Reaches as fast as possible, and in a region far from most laws and regulations, they had pressed Wenar Industrial to get their facilities up and running as quickly as possible. Wenar had therefore pushed its construction teams \u2013 the majority of which were client races \u2013 hard, with the expected consequences of high worker fatigue, lax safety measures and inadequate oversight.", "Consequently, Salanz\u2019s smelting facility had a notoriously high rate of injury and fatalities among its construction crew. When One Thousand Cisterns took over and began operations, this trend continued as many corners had been cut during construction, particularly in safety measures. Little was done to remedy these issues, as One Thousand Cisterns was largely concerned with rapid growth to fuel its further expansions and the time and resources necessary to bring the facility up to code was not considered cost-effective. Buying silence (or threatening legal action to compel it) and paying a few medical bills was cheaper. As far as the cost in personnel went, both Wenar and One Thousand Cisterns had no lack of workers.", "These individuals did have the option of refusing the job, but as contract employees, a breach of their agreed-upon terms could result in them being blacklisted, as an \u201cunreliable\u201d worker was hardly the sort that reputable corporations looked to hire. There was also the risk that Wenar, or any similar company, might take legal action against the employees who broke their contracts in order to recoup any wages already paid, costs of transportation and habitation and other such expenses.", "Indeed, many of Wenar\u2019s employees had backed out of other such jobs with unsafe conditions and discovered that only companies of less than stellar reputations were willing to take them on now, the result of being deemed untrustworthy. Facing financial pressure, these individuals took what jobs they could in the hopes of getting back on their feet and rebuilding their work reputations. Still other workers simply didn\u2019t have the correct skillset or education for much beyond minor technical positions and industrial labour, but could still be given \u2018on-the-job\u2019 training \u2013 at least enough to get the job done.", "There was the occasional inspection, clucked tongue and wagged fingers, but as one of the first facilities established in the region, Salanz supplied superior-grade material to many other companies and colonies, including the nearby and always-ravenous Galhmena. As long as Salanz\u2019s rate of production and quality remained high, minor chastisements about the conditions were traded for empty promises to do something. A few token gestures were taken, a minor bit of renovation and upgrading to handle the worst of the trouble spots.

The act of terrorism was tracked back to an organization known as the Broken Triangle, pro-union radicals and noisome workers\u2019 rights advocates that had been stirring up trouble on Salanz for several years, despite the best efforts of One Thousand Cisterns to root them out. Their symbol matched their name; the top part of a triangle supported by a deliberately scratched-out lower section, indicating that the uppermost part was nothing without the larger portion that held it aloft.", "During a raid on a Broken Triangle meeting, Enforcers discovered propaganda and signage featuring a variation on the organization\u2019s sigil. In the once-empty lower portion, there was a red palmprint. An attempt was made to suppress this potentially inflammatory information, but it was quickly leaked by unknown individuals. Local authorities did their best to downplay the significance, dismissing the symbol as belonging to a splinter group of radicals hoping to use the heraldry of a notorious terrorist organization to further their aims. This interpretation was supported by Salanz\u2019s board of directors, desperate to avoid probes by Compact security agencies. Business as usual might allow One Thousand Cistern\u2019s profit-maximizing strategies of indolence and neglect to continue, but if it were determined that those strategies had allowed a terrorist cell take root, the consequences would go well beyond a weakened bottom line.", "In hindsight, the bombing of the Malgin Managerial Complex would be considered the opening move of the Red Hand\u2019s war in the Veiled Reaches. It was not, as first thought, a random and hastily-concocted terrorist plot performed by disgruntled, entitled workers. The operation had taken months of planning after years of groundwork both on-planet and elsewhere. In the wake of the bombing and the revelations of Red Hand activity on Salanz, One Thousand Cisterns\u2019 share price briefly but substantially dropped, allowing several opportunistic investors to short-sell company stocks and make a handsome profit. These investors would later be discovered to be fronts for Red Hand financiers. The attack hadn\u2019t simply been a political statement, but also been a means for the organization to profit off the carnage it caused, building up its war chest.", "At present however, the deaths caused on Salanz simply seemed the result of random, unprovoked violence targeted by the lower classes at their betters, perhaps the result of the suspected division within the Red Hand\u2019s ranks now that their Crusade Commander was dead and no new leader had established themselves. Sporadic, uncoordinated violence had been the organization\u2019s hallmark in the weeks following the death of Andrew Jackson and the losses suffered in 1893-Yiren. The sector\u2019s authorities merely noted one more act of barbarism to be laid at the feet of demagogues and psychotic would-be revolutionaries, one more unconnected dot speckling a map\u2026", "~", "In the wake of the Red Hand\u2019s confrontation with the Lady of Sorrow, the situation on the Grasp became less tense. The likelihood of a clan war had, if not diminished entirely, returned to normal levels and with two of their officers exposed as colluding with the late and unlamented Axex Vanig, Grasp Security had likewise backed off \u2013 while most of their officers were on the take to some degree or another, having it come out publicly was bad optics. It was easier and cleaner to tie the whole mess off, deeming the loss of their men to be the price of those officers\u2019 actions.", "There were a few public statements from Grasp Security and the governor\u2019s office about the need for vigilance against corruption, a special oversight committee was appointed to Do Something and           Allyria\u2019s actions were brushed off as self-defence against two low-ranking of obvious low-character harassing her at the behest of a \u2018known criminal\u2019 who\u2019d of course been the target of a long-running investigation. Overall, a lot of words were offered but the message was the same. Things were returning to normal on the station.", "Grace hated that. She couldn\u2019t stand listening to those vacuous speeches and empty promises. Nothing would change. Nothing would ever change. Nobody wanted it to. None of them cared that the fucking system they were all so invested in kept grinding up the people on the bottom. People like her and like Allyria. It made her sick. No, that wasn\u2019t really true. It didn\u2019t make her sick; it made her hate.", "She was back in the hospital, sitting at Allyria\u2019s side. The Verrish still hadn\u2019t woken up, at least not for any length of time. Sometimes her eyes opened and she tried to speak, but she fell back asleep just as quickly. The doctors told Grace that that was a good sign. She was getting her strength back, but it was a slow process. She\u2019d been given regeneration treatments. Those had saved her life, but she still required frequent monitoring. Even within a species, medical nanites and regeneration therapies could have adverse effects or cause unexpected reactions, especially if they weren\u2019t tailored to the recipient. Grace trusted Red to take care of Allyria. She\u2019d done it before\u2026 but the physicians here were barely familiar with Verrish physiology. They\u2019d only ever treated the dead officers for minor injuries.", "Allyria been taken for two additional surgeries, one of which had been an emergency as she\u2019d started to bleed into her own lungs. At least now she was out of critical condition. Grace spent every moment she could with her, dividing her time between Allyria, eating, sleeping and overseeing Brightest Night\u2019s repairs. She tried to keep her mind on that, on the duties and responsibility she\u2019d been given, but it was hard to keep a clear mind when her oldest, best friend, and the woman she loved was lying here helpless. She made the effort, though. She was grateful for Colony Zanim, her first officer. They were a veteran of the Red Hand, and Tavanis had assigned them personally to temporarily assist the \u2018new-blooded\u2019 leader in getting her ship back together and crew re-assembled.", "Grace had never met a Conjoiner before. She\u2019d asked Zanim how they felt about working under an officer with as little experience as she had. \u201cWe are pleased to offer our assistance,\u201d Zanim had replied. \u201cWe are not what the Space Force would call \u2018fire-eaters\u2019. Combat is not our forte, but we serve the cause in our own way.\u201d Atypically for an Unbound cartel, the Red Hand valued its administrative personnel as more than mere \u2018pebble counters\u2019. Accountants and financial experts were prized by all syndicates, if only to track their funds and ensure it was being distributed and cleaned properly, but when it came to those who handled non-monetary assets, even some of the largest clans could be dismissive or openly contemptuous. The Red Hand wasn\u2019t merely a criminal syndicate, though; it was an army fighting a war and its logistics branch was every bit as important as its political, military and financial aspects.", "Grace had found the Conjoiner\u2019s self-assessment to be accurate: they had no head (well, distributed neural network, but that didn\u2019t have the same ring to it) for tactics, but Colony Zanim was helpful at navigating her through the intricacies of Red Hand administration and the Grasp\u2019s own laws. She had learned from the Compact, she had learned from Red and now she was learning more. Some days it felt like she\u2019d never understand it all and some days, everything just seemed to fall in place.", "There hadn\u2019t been many of those days lately.", "Grace\u2019s head was resting on the mattress, only half-awake. Next to her was a copy of personnel duties listings and maintenance reports that she\u2019d tried to read twice already, but couldn\u2019t focus on. She\u2019d get to them after visiting hours were over. She tried to keep busy and most times that worked, but Allyria was restless today. She would occasionally stir, or make a pained noise and her tintas were twitching. Grace had straightened them out twice, running her hands gently down Allyria\u2019s head-tails. When she did that, the other girl seemed to relax. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Grace had told her. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m here.\u201d", "She tried to go back to her reports and she got halfway through a new page when Allyria moved, letting out a soft, long hiss of breath. Grace raised her head as Allyria\u2019s eyes opened, expecting them to close just as quickly. Instead, the Verrish woman\u2019s nostrils flared as she inhaled, her tongue flicking out. \u201cGrace\u2026?\u201d she said softly, her voice rough and unsure.", "\u201cYes,\u201d Grace replied, grabbing her friend\u2019s hand and putting it on her cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s me. I\u2019m here.\u201d", "Allyria licked her lips. \u201cYou stink,\u201d she whispered. The same thing she had told Grace the last time she\u2019d woken up in an infirmary, back aboard Nemesis.", "Grace started laughing and crying, burrowing her face into Allyria\u2019s palm. \u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re back, you\u2019re back\u2026\u201d", "\u201cGrace\u2026\u201d Allyria repeated, cupping the smaller woman\u2019s head in her hands. \u201cGrace,\u201d she said again.", "\u201cYou\u2019re thirsty,\u201d Grace said. \u201cLet me get you something. I\u2019ll call the doctor and-\u201d", "\u201cGrace,\u201d Allyria interrupted, her voice shaking. \u201cI can\u2019t see.\u201d", "~", "The scent of blood filled Nasham\u2019s nostrils as he dreamt.", "It was after the slaughter aboard the derelict. The machine\u2019s avatar was standing before him in the empty hangar. \u201cThey\u2019ll believe you,\u201d it said. \u201cThey\u2019ll believe that I never meant to come here. You\u2019ll tell them that.\u201d She\u2019d killed everyone else on the Bequeathed expedition. There was no blood on this machine form, but he remembered when there had been. He remembered the shrilling of a saw as it cut through bone and the feel of metal fingers on his throat. That was another time and another place, though. Here, he was within her belly.", "Something moved in the shadows, stepping into view and standing behind the machine. A female human, with olive skin and eyes a hue of green completely foreign to Nasham\u2019s own species. He knew who it was. He\u2019d seen her in reports. The machine\u2019s sibling. The thing the Compact had tried and failed to leash.", "\u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive my sister\u2019s defensiveness,\u201d the human said, smiling, but there was something predatory and hungry about her grin, threatening even with a human\u2019s small, unimpressive teeth. \u201cShe tends the fields. We want to ensure a healthy harvest.\u201d", "\u201cWhat,\u201d Nasham asked, \u201care you growing?\u201d", "He didn\u2019t get an answer, but the floor beneath him was no longer a deck. It was bone, powdered to dust and swampy with blood. From beneath the surface, thick stalks of metal and circuitry arose. Flesh grew over them, their branching fronds turning red and raw as muscle, sinew and skin transformed the venous machinery into delicate five-fingered hands. Human hands.", "Nasham pulled away from the grotesque display, when he turned away, he found himself in one of Invida\u2019s blood-soaked corridors. At the end of the hall, as if seen through a haze, the station\u2019s defenders fired upon their advancing attackers. They fell within seconds and suddenly, Nasham was standing amidst the dead. Faces he recognized and some he didn\u2019t, corpses rotting from two thousand years of butchery, decaying into plant meal.", "\u201cEvery death,\u201d the machine said, its voice all around him, \u201cmakes me stronger. It feeds my young.\u201d", "\u201cThis isn\u2019t real,\u201d Nasham told himself, struggling to hold back a surge of panic, banishing the echoes of the trauma that had almost destroyed him once before. \u201cThis isn\u2019t real!\u201d", "\u201cSssh,\u201d the machine said. Now, she was standing behind the human. The woman held an infant in her arms, the child suckling at her breast. \u201cYou\u2019ll disturb her.\u201d ", "Nasham approached, looking at the small creature the human was holding. Human children looked much alike to him, but he thought this one was female. Its eyes opened and it looked up at Nasham. They were blue and gleamed with an unnatural light. The infant smiled and let go of her mother\u2019s nipple, tiny fists waving at the Tribune. There was a drop of wetness around the child\u2019s mouth, but it wasn\u2019t milk. It was dark and had a sickly sheen to it. It was oil, he realized.", "The machine\u2019s hands sidled up around the human\u2019s torso and cupped her breasts, its fingers getting wet with the fluid dripping from the woman\u2019s body. The human made an unclean noise at her sister\u2019s touch, smiling at Nasham. Still holding onto its flesh-and-blood sibling with one hand, the machine held the other arm out, metallic droplets hanging from its fingers. One landed on the child\u2019s face. It giggled.", "\u201cReceive this gift,\u201d the machine said, reaching towards Nasham. \u201cAccept our blessing and we can shape you, just like we\u2019ll shape them\u2026\u201d", "Nasham awoke with a start. He sat up in bed, his nostrils flaring as he slowed his breathing. Sweat made his mane stick against his scalp, his throat was raw and dry and his skin felt clammy. The young man pulled himself out of bed and entered the bathroom, bracing himself against the sink and staring at his image in the mirror until his breathing slowed.", "\u201cThat was a bad one,\u201d Vinsea said as she stood at the doorway. She was still wearing her trousers and tunic, both rumpled from sleep. They\u2019d been working with the intelligence division, turning Nasham\u2019s near-obsessive notes and self-directed project into actionable case histories, psychoanalyses and studies of the members of the Bequeathed expedition. The Bastion Leader herself had asked for an update on their work, sending a ship back to Rally to request more detailed information on the Broken cadets and their family and associates. If there were varak in the walls, now was the time to find out.", "After another frustrating day of trying to turn maybe into possibly with personnel records and Nasham\u2019s own recollections, Vinsea had suggested taking a break from the issue and letting the computer\u2019s own pattern analysis programs chew on it. The intelligence officer and Nasham had closed the shift with a few drinks at one of Light of Judgement\u2019s bars, returning to Nasham\u2019s quarters for some conversation not related to work or their mission. Vinsea had been interested in what it was like living on Rally after spending time in the proper, civilized expanses of the Compact and Nasham had found himself warming to the topic. They\u2019d stayed up late talking until exhaustion had finally taken its toll and Nasham had retired to the bedroom. Vinsea had slept on the sofa.", "\u201cYes,\u201d Nasham admitted, towelling the perspiration from his scalp and neck. \u201cOne of the worst in a long time.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s the nebula,\u201d Vinsea guessed.", "Nasham nodded slowly. The execution force was still sniffing its way through the Black Veil\u2019s outermost systems, looking for traces of their enemy and finding nothing. It was here, though. 1893-Yiren. The minefield. She was here. He could feel her, knew she was somewhere in this expanse of choking afterbirth of stars and planets. Gathering strength. Waiting. Breeding. \u201cPartly,\u201d he conceded, looking back at his reflection in the mirror. \u201cThe work we\u2019ve been doing hasn\u2019t helped.\u201d Looking for traitors, trying to decide which of the dead had been murdered and which had betrayed the Compact\u2026 which of the names he\u2019d remembered were now profane had taken more of a toll than he\u2019d thought.", "Vinsea came closer, putting one hand on Nasham\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d she asked.", "He closed all four eyes. He saw again a field of flesh and metal fed by bone and blood, a generation of soulless things rising out of the dead. The mind of a god. \u201cThe future,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we fail.\u201d", "The young woman put her head on the side of his shoulder. \u201cThen we\u2019ll make sure that we don\u2019t.\u201d", "How many others in our place had the same resolve? He almost asked that question. Months before, he would have. Now, he placed one of his hands over Vinsea\u2019s. \u201cAs the Triarchs will,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd by own our blood.\u201d", "Whatever horror was being born in the Black Veil, it could not be allowed to spread. He told himself that, but inside he wasn\u2019t sure if they could. The old thought still came to him, that they were the toys of the gods. Sometimes, though\u2026 sometimes it wasn\u2019t the toys who broke.", "~", "Once you see it, the woman with the clever eyes had told Nenkot, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have any trouble knowing.", "She\u2019d been right. He hadn\u2019t had any trouble at all realizing what his contact would consider interesting about Galhemna.", "The work was demanding, but it was fulfilling. At least, that was what Nenkot heard from his fellow EVA construction crews. The special project he\u2019d been selected for had certainly lived up to its name. A level-seven shipwomb had been constructed starward of the orbit of Vumot, Galhemna\u2019s second planet. Instead of the usual open, skeletal sprawl of gantries, docks, cargo bays, girders and work hangars, this facility was a massive flattened ovoid, its internal workings completely hidden from view by a slate-grey hull, worker barracks, administrative facilities, construction zones and industrial nodes bulging from the womb like blisters on a toad. It was hard to keep construction on this scale a secret in any star system, especially one as busy as Galhemna, but the nature of the work had been covered up with rumours of new battleship construction, examination of captured Jackal warships and even prototype carriers. Anything to conceal the truth of what it was inside the facility\u2019s walls.", "Galhemna was building Chariots. Three of them. Two were Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment-class heavy variants and the third was a Sundering Walls of the Mightiest Fortress-class missile platform. They had only just begun construction and were little more than skeletal pieces of their superstructure, armoured core and shock systems held together by work gantries and structural supports. That would change, though. There were thousands of construction workers, industrial drones, tugs and assembly automatons crawling and drifting through the monstrous, bloated shipwomb, transports laden with technology bounties and factory complexes running day and night. In less than two years, these three titans would be operational.", "Despite everything in his life, Nenkot still couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of awe as he imagined the day that those three behemoths would emerge from their cradles, their newborn drives igniting and carrying them across the system to their trials and, from there, to serve the Compact. Chariots were the power and majesty of the Compact given form in iron and steel \u2013 well, what passed for iron and steel. Nenkot supposed terms like \u2018composite layered alloys\u2019 and \u2018nano-constructed energy-dissipative ceramics\u2019 had less poetry to them.", "The Worker stood. He was in a small tram cab filled with other workers coming off their shifts on its way to one of the housing sections. Zero-g welders were slumped in their chairs next to drone operators, administrators typing on their datascrolls as they sat next to cargo haulers and engineers. The construction of those ships required men and women from all walks of life to work in concert for a single goal. A common purpose, a shared sense of unity.", "BUILDING A FUTURE TOGETHER said the posters and government ads. Nenkot had heard those kinds of words before from confessors, newscasters, officials and his own people, but he\u2019d come to understand differently. The Compact served the Compact, and he wasn\u2019t part of their idea \u2018together\u2019. He stood, holding onto a guide rail as the tram car ran along its magnetic track, the Worker staring out the window at the bare skeleton of one of the Chariots. It was hard to look on that, knowing what it would become, and not have doubts about what he was doing. The Compact endured. It had survived six millennia against all the horrors the galaxy had spawned. The Anorax, the Valthus, the Great Betrayal and the Principality. It had brought education, literacy and civilization to more than a dozen species, sheltering them from the predators that the Compact itself had encountered. It endured.", "Nenkot continued to stare at the vessel as the tram continued along, watching right up until his view was blocked by the terminal and the rest of the passengers billowed out of the car to find their way to their apartments. He followed, pushing his way through the milling press of bodies, his face blank as he thought. There was the money he\u2019d been promised. The chance to do something about all the doubts he\u2019d been silently nursing for years, but never really spoke aloud, not until his contact had found him. He remembered staring over the rim of his mug of steaming peca, looking into those strange eyes of hers. It was the last time they\u2019d met.", "\u201cAll right,\u201d he\u2019d agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d She\u2019d smiled in a way he\u2019d never seen before.", "He reached his quarters and unlocked the door, stepping into his small, tidy flat. It was permeated with the smell of broth coming from the slow cooker in the kitchenette. He didn\u2019t have much, but it was more than some. He\u2019d often chafed at being given what others deemed he was worth.", "Now, he wasn\u2019t sure. He was doubting what he was doing. A lifetime of education and indoctrination was telling him to just continue with his work. Stay silent and never contact her again, or go straight to the nearest security office with what he knew. The Compact had given his people everything, raising them from savages to the muscles and sinews of industry. It had given him another chance after the mistakes of his youth. It had shown him trust in elevating him to this position, rewarding him for his initiative and experience. He was being given the chance to build the Compact\u2019s greatest machines, the vessels that secured peace and stability for trillions and would be the conveyances of the Triarchs themselves.", "He entered the washroom and paused, staring at himself in the mirror. \u201cA Worker,\u201d he said aloud. Not an Ar\u2019densai. A Worker. An alien name. A definition given to his people, a role, a yoke that he\u2019d grown tired of wearing. He turned away from his reflection, wondering just who and what it was that he saw there\u2026 and what that person should do next.", "~", "To the galaxy at large, this system had no name. It was simply one faint light amongst many in the nebula, not even visible through the outer shell of dust that gave the Black Veil its name. It did have a name, though, a simple appellation to note its role. It was called Node 005 and it was where the first battle of Kursk would be fought.", "Other than Rangda, none of the other Leyaks had individual designations, their identities delineated solely by hull markings and IFF codes. DDK(S)-01.5.2, Leyak Two, passed by a gas giant, its blocky silhouette vanishing as smart paint rippled with colour like a cuttlefish\u2019s skin, perfectly matching Two to its background and making it impossible for visual surveillance to pick up the destroyer. It could be detected other ways, but Two was running under strict emissions control, using the radiance of the planet to conceal the release of its own waste heat. Leyak power distribution and cooling systems were not as efficient as those of other vessels and they needed to vent their thermal waste more frequently, though still less often than crewed starships.", "Its task complete, Two moved away from the planet and reactivated its stealth systems, receiving the tickling input of a nearby Yaojing\u2019s tightbeams as the spindly command vessel coordinated the movements of Two and its siblings. Each Leyak was not sapient, nor was it intended to be. They were drone ships, lacking intuition and creativity and relied on more developed command units for effective coordination. Still, they remained deadly enough.", "Stealth technology was difficult to use, both in and out of in battle. Among the many issues, a full cloak blinded its user\u2019s sensor systems as surely as its foes \u2013 often more so. Datalinks from recon platforms or friendly ships were essential for any long-term operations and a vessel running under stealth had to remain largely powered down to prevent its own emissions from bleeding through. Anything larger than a battleship was all but impossible to run under cloak and even those required some additional obfuscating variables to prevent themselves from being detected. A dreadnought was simply too powerful to completely conceal. Smaller vessels were easier, and could cause substantial damage if they could catch their target unawares.", "The Leyak-class stealth destroyer was designed with this combat philosophy in mind. It was an experimental design, more of a proof of concept and had yet to be fully tested or vetted as a battle-line unit. Their shift systems were rudimentary and only capable of very short warp jumps with high cool-down periods and were utterly incapable of keeping pace with more modern starships. Their FTL technology was not the focus of their design, however.", "Leyaks could be considered a form of technological evolution analogous to the designs currently being rushed to completion within the Askanj Principality, though the stealth destroyers predated the Principality\u2019s own development by several decades. Despite the shortcomings in their designs, each Leyak was built around two systems: extremely advanced cloaking technology, and fortress-scale missile launchers.", "The former was an experiment of Red One\u2019s to push the capabilities of stealth system, and examine how her refinements to cloaking and EW systems operated outside of simulations and theory. The latter was an attempt to test the efficacy and usefulness of hunter-killer hull designs. Each Leyak\u2019s primary weapons were so large that the destroyers had little room for any additional armaments, more than a third of their volume taken up by four massive launch tubes, a single antiship particle beam and the systems required to feed and operate those weapons. The Leyak\u2019s remaining weaponry was relegated to point defences and light energy mounts more suited to intercepting attack craft than engaging other starships. In any direct conflict, they were at a substantial disadvantage against any opponent that could get out of their prow arc. However, the Leyaks were not intended for direct combat. Like their namesakes, they were meant to prey upon on the unwary and alone.", "Though they were primarily testing platforms that would be unimpressive in large-scale fleet operations, Two and its siblings scattered across Node 005 remained silent as they waited to ambush their enemy. Whether they lived or died made no difference to them. Only fulfilling their mission mattered and if that meant their destruction, then so be it."]}

Shortly before impact, the vessel\u2019s autopilot managed to retake partial helm control, preventing the transport from being lost within the planet, but leading to its crash on one of the giant\u2019s many moons. A weak automatic beacon was the only clue as to the freighter\u2019s final resting place.", "It remained there for decades until Nemesis, on her way out of the region, passed through the system and detected the crashed vessel\u2019s transmission. After the battle that had killed its crew and the pirates\u2019 looting, all that was left was a hull and a shock system, but the Ceorlyn series of transports had a reputation for solid construction. Wake of Futures\u2019s main superstructure was still intact. The vessel was salvageable, though most other agencies would have written it off as not worth the effort. Red One saw another potential use in the crashed starship.", "It took more than two decades for the meager industrial facilities in the Black Veil to get the ship functional, but once it was, it became another piece of verisimilitude for Kursk and another morsel to feed the Compact. As it unknowingly waited for that day, it was selected for another duty. Decades after it had been thought dead, Wake of Futures was given its first and final mission.", "This time, it would truly die.", "~", "\u201cTell me you have something,\u201d Advocate Denren (and three names besides), the leader of Sesek Squad, Compact Janissary Corps, insisted.", "\u201cWorking,\u201d Advocate, Submissive Alseire (and two names besides) snapped back. She was kneeling in front of a computer hub, its panels removed. They were in Comp Cent of a Series-46 Ceorlyn, a vessel close to a century out of date, but still serviceable and quite functional, as the events of the last sixty hours proved. The only illumination in the chamber came from running lights along the floor, diodes on the computer hub and access panels. The computer core wasn\u2019t terrible large; it was built into a single deck. Perfectly adequate for the needs of a freighter. That was good. It made Alseire\u2019s job easier.", "Cords ran from the infiltration computer built into the Jansisary\u2019s armour\u2019s left vambrace to the molecular circuitry and fibrous cables of the starship\u2019s computer core. It was just as old as the rest of the ship, but its operating system had been upgraded, with increased levels of security and encryption. Alseire was a technical specialist, trained to infiltrate, disrupt and override hostile networks. Her marksmanship was just barely enough to keep her qualified as a front-line soldier, but that wasn\u2019t her job. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d she said, as her fingers flew over the holographic displays, doing Triarchs-knew-what with subroutines, coding and algorithms. Whenever she tried to describe her job, Denren felt all four of his eyes start to glaze over. Still, she was effective and he\u2019d never had cause to doubt her efficacy. If she ever put in for an uplink enhancement, Denren would support her. \u201cWhat are they?\u201d she continued, though the question was redundant.", "\u201cI think we know,\u201d the advocate replied. Truth be told, he didn\u2019t have any other answer to offer his subordinate \u2013 except the glaringly obvious. They both knew what was on this ship. They both knew what their enemies were. Alseire never stopped working as Denren stood over her, ready to protect the specialist to the last.", "The dead were coming for them.", "~", "Two days earlier, a scouting squadron from Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro had entered this nameless system, one of many recon groups sweeping ever-deeper into the nebula as they searched for traces of their foe \u2018Gravestone\u2019. Well, they\u2019d found one all right. Three ships of civilian make that had refused to answer any hails and begun running the instant they realized that they\u2019d gotten the attention of a Compact attack force. The chase had lasted nearly the entirety of those two days, with the crews of Group Leader Prime Lanet\u2019s squadron devoutly hoping they weren\u2019t expending all this energy and time on minor pirates, or wildcat miners. That would have been\u2026 irksome.", "Running across another Scar would probably have been worse, though.", "Denren didn\u2019t know much about Gravestone; much of the information was classified and restricted to the higher-ups, but he knew that it was enough of a threat to assemble and launch this Execution Force and that meant it was something to take seriously. As for the rest, he had trust in his superiors and faith in the Triarchs. What they deemed to be a threat must be. He was a Tribune, a member of the Space Force and an advocate in the Janissary Corps. He knew his duty. It was as simple and direct as he himself was. To fight all enemies of the Compact. To be the sword that warded civilization from all threats, whether it was the grasping machinations of the Jackals, the barbarism and atavistic violence of its own wards, the predations of dangerous nations and species outside the Compact\u2019s control, or more ephemeral foes like Gravestone.", "He just never realized how serious a threat this particular enemy was until he and more than a hundred other Janissaries had boarded Wake of Futures and found what was waiting for them.", "~", "The more you bleed for a prize, the more you convince yourself that it\u2019s worth.", "That was the guiding principle behind this operation. The Compact invaders would reach Node 05 on their own, of course. They might have only just begun to infest the outer edges of Confederate territory, but they were methodical in their advance. They would reach the Node system eventually. The longer it took, the more time the Fleet had to prepare. The more likely it was that the industry currently at work on Command\u2019s special project would complete that task and become available to assist in defence projection. So time was necessary, but the Fleet could not allow the Enemy to operate solely on their own schedule. There was a point at which the time the Fleet gained was offset by ceding the initiative to their foes. So Node 05 would be discovered, yes. The Enemy would locate it\u2026 but they had to be drawn to it the right way. Their attention had to be caught, their eye pulled towards this one system in particular. It had to happen on the Fleet\u2019s timetable, not the Enemy\u2019s.", "If they circumnavigated Node 05, if they decided to blockade it and lay siege instead of attacking directly, if they attempted to strike past the system\u2026 these were all possibilities that could cause greater problems for the Fleet. +they need,+ Violet Seven had said. +a performance+", "That was why Violet Nine was here. The meeting between Lanet\u2019s reconnaissance detachment and the handful of Fleet ships here wasn\u2019t by chance. This system had been calculated as the most likely of the Enemy\u2019s next targets to scout. This system was where Wake of Futures would die and where the Enemy would catch the scent of their prey.", "This was where the war would start again.", "~", "Two of the transports hadn\u2019t been transports at all. At least, not cargo transports. They\u2019d been Triarchs-cursed Q-ships, modified with heavy point defences and over-filled with missiles. The latter points had been discovered when Group Leader Prime Lanet brought his vessels into range. The two Q-ships had opened fire with salvos far heavier than anything the Compact ships had had, but true to their natures, they\u2019d been eggshells. While Lanet\u2019s ships had received only minor to moderate damage, the Compact squadron\u2019s return fire had destroyed both attackers, each Q-ship so overburdened with ordnance that they\u2019d gone up like tinderboxes. There\u2019d been no possibility of survivors, nor anything worth salvaging.", "Lanet had been determined to capture the third vessel intact; analysis of enemy fire patterns, communications traffic and ship movements had suggested that it was the command vessel; certainly both Q-ships had been trying to protect it. Their suicidal charge had been a distraction aiming to cover it long enough to get past the shock limit. The gambit had almost succeeded. Almost. The vessel had been intercepted and crippled before it could escape. Its crew remained obstinately silent. Even the most close-mouthed insurgent, pirate or ship leader should have spoken up at that point, to impotently threaten, meekly surrender or rant and rave. Instead, the transport still refused all hails.", "If only they\u2019d known then what that signified. The thought had been that the enemy were going to commit suicide, waiting for Lanet\u2019s ships to get closer before destroying themselves in the hope of taking some of the Compact forces with them. The Compact forces knew the Red Hand were treacherous. They\u2019d been briefed that Gravestone was dangerous and should not be underestimated. They\u2019d planned for every contingency, whether the enemy was fanatics, Jackal infiltrators or something else. Bellicose Thrust and its support ships would hold back a safe distance as assault craft boarding the transport. Janissary teams would secure the vessel and take its crew into custody. The vessel would be sent back to 1887-Yiren for further analysis and processing. If the enemy refused to speak, then they would be made to talk.", "A hundred Janissaries boarded the ship. Enough to seize a city. Denren believed they\u2019d been prepared. It wasn\u2019t arrogance. It was confidence. At least, until the dead talked.", "~", "There was a particular stench to alien ships, Violet Nine thought. The reek of emissions patterns that weren\u2019t quite normal, the fetid taste of inhuman drive systems. They felt\u2026 incorrect. Wrong. Repulsive. Even the repurposed Fleet assets still had this aura about them, though Nine knew that they were an unfortunate necessary. The Fleet was still rebuilding and it used what tools it could. She accepted that. It was irritating, but no more than that.", "The presence of five alien warships so close to her was more than irritating. She could feel them, as if they were a miasma of filth, every erg of them revolting to the AI. They were not human and had no right to exist within Confederate territory. Violet Five would have already attacked, even if the destroyer was badly outgunned. Nine did nothing. She merely waited, observing the Compact warships. Tethered sensor probes fed data to her through her cloaking field as she studied her enemy.", "Seven had wanted to be here, but Tohil\u2019s stealth systems were not as developed as Shaushka\u2019s, Rangda was not at all suitable and Jor\u014dgumo had yet to be roused, so Violet Nine was on her own for this mission. The escort carrier remained under cloak, the stench of alien power signatures calling her to kill, but she suppressed that instinct. Even if a heavy cruiser, two cruisers and two destroyers weren\u2019t more than she could handle, any precipitous action would ruin everything.", "So she waited, watching as Wake of Futures was boarded, parasitic assault craft latching themselves to its hull or coring into its hangars. She watched this, and reached out to the stricken vessel, opening a line to its internal communications and sensor systems. Not to guide, speak or control \u2013 just to listen. As she did so, a sensation spread through her mind and if she\u2019d been able to, she would have smiled.", "~", "\u201cBlood of the Triarchs,\u201d someone breathed.", "\u201cComm discipline,\u201d Denren snapped, but the rejoinder was flat and without condemnation. In truth, he couldn\u2019t think of any epithet less apt than what one of his Janissaries had just uttered, and quite a few more so.", "They\u2019d boarded the enemy vessel, expecting to encounter resistance. Instead, all teams were reporting situation blue, no enemy contacts. Sesek Squad was the first to discover why. They\u2019d forced their way into the hangar control room. Inside, sitting in the chairs where supervisors and staff would have been, were the rotted remains of its crew.", "As Denren approached one of the corpses, the computer screens blinked to life. It flashed a message that was soon discovered elsewhere, on other monitors and even smeared across the walls, six words that made ice form in the Advocate\u2019s liver. Not for what they said, but for the promise they made.", "Flesh is weak.", "Make it strong.", "~", "Wake of Futures hadn\u2019t just been a Fleet transport; it had been one of Tohil\u2019s tenders. It had been crewed by personnel from Tohil and trained by Violet Seven. He\u2019d had once told Nine that Wake of Futures was a hobby, a tableau he frequently updated and modified, like a painter not quite satisfied with his work. Nine wasn\u2019t quite sure about what all that meant, only that it was almost certainly more of Seven\u2019s indecorous proclivities. To see that being taken up by other Fleet units rankled the more proper Nine further.", "She had sent communiques and queries to Command about the nonspec activities, modifications, behaviours and potentially unbecoming conduct of Wake of Futures\u2019s crew and complement but, it appeared that Seven and his tender had not yet violated the codes of conduct\u2026 at least egregiously. Allowances were necessary during war. She understood that, but she still felt it was her duty as an AI and officer of the United Earth Confederate Navy to make note of it.", "Today, she was making a lot of notes. Not all of them, however, were condemnations.", "~", "Command was dark and deserted. All the control consoles had been destroyed. The main viewscreen had been smashed. Spray painted over it was the same declaration they\u2019d encountered elsewhere. There were more corpses on the bridge, once again sitting at their stations as if they\u2019d died there. Denren had seen a lot in his service to the Compact. The living and the dead twisted and mutilated by every kind of weapon. Men, women and children puking blood from radiation poisoning. Soldiers screaming as they tried to hold their shredded bodies together. Decades of all that and more and there was still something about this ship that unsettled him.", "It wasn\u2019t the dead themselves. It was the care someone had taken to arrange all this. The vessel could have been blown into wreckage, suffered hull decompressions and all this could have been sucked into space. There was a good chance that no one would have ever seen any of it\u2026 but someone had done it anyways. The advocate didn\u2019t like what that said about the mind behind all this.", "\u201cWhere are they?\u201d Serm had growled. \u201cThere has to be someone on this Black-cursed ship!

The joints of the medic\u2019s power armour purred as he knelt in front of the ragged figure on the ship\u2019s command throne. It was \u2013 or at least had been \u2013 a Tribune woman dressed in the uniform of the Space Force. Her skull sagged down her chest, scraps of desiccated skin hanging from her face and torso. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing that because there\u2019s no them.\u201d", "\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Serm put in, the other Janissary turning to face Tenkik.", "\u201cHaven\u2019t you figured it out yet?\u201d the corpsman said.

Why?\u201d", "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Denren cut off Tenkik\u2019s response. He knew what the medic was going to say, that this wasn\u2019t a drone. His people didn\u2019t need to hear that. Not right now. \u201cThis ship was identified as potentially valuable. Our mission is to sweep and secure, not debate why who did what. We\u2019ve all seen worse than some dusty bones and bits of skin, so stay clear.\u201d The advocate turned to the squad\u2019s specialist. \u201cSubmissive Alseire.

A chittering tide of beetles emerged from the vents on command, swarming over Lutil, her screams ending in a wet, ragged gurgle. Sesek squad\u2019s fire blew massive holes in the horde, but there were simply too many to stop at, not at such close quarters.

People he could imagine getting his hands on, crushing their skulls or tearing them limb from limb in revenge for these heresies. People he could find and put a stop to.

Seven\u2019s designs were sufficient; they were superior to most organic soldiers, but not to the same degree as units deployed by Command. They were sufficient for this task, however.

Good men and women were dying to these things. It was obscene. It was heresy, using machines draped in the dead to kill the living. There wasn\u2019t any punishment that Denren could imagine being a fitting enough retribution for this kind of depravity.

They\u2019d bought a few more precious moments. He turned to Alseire, but he didn\u2019t need to give any orders. She was already working, connecting to the starship\u2019s core to acquire its data. He checked the comm, listening to the reports of the other squads. Vanen was down. The rest of the boarding teams were heavily engaged. No one else would be coming.", "\u201cComm array\u2019s still active,\u201d Alseire told him. \u201cYou can patch in. They haven\u2019t shut it down yet, but once they know we\u2019re broadcasting, it won\u2019t be up for long.\u201d", "\u201cDo you have computer access?\u201d", "\u201cI won\u2019t be able to break through all the encryption, but I think I\u2019ve found something the fleet can use.

Denren swept the computer core, but it was deserted. All the hostiles were out there, killing his comrades. He occasionally asked Alseire if she\u2019d had success, but he left her to her task. Fewer and fewer voices were on the squad channel now. There weren\u2019t many of his people left, but the enemy was close to being spent, too. They\u2019d thrown everything they\u2019d had at the Janissary teams, but it wasn\u2019t enough.", "\u201cI have it,\u201d the submissive reported with exhausted victory. \u201cI have the data.\u201d", "\u201cPatch me in,\u201d Denren ordered urgently.", "Alseire connected their suit comms to the starship\u2019s own array, using it to defeat the layers of signal-scattering bulkheads between the Janissaries and their ship. Normally, they would route their comms through their boarding craft\u2026 but that was no longer an option. \u201cSesek to Bellicose Thrust,\u201d Denren began. \u201cPosition untenable. Prepare to receive data.\u201d He gestured and Alseire began sending everything she could, fighting the computer\u2019s own defences every step of the way. He didn\u2019t know how much was usuable, but he trusted his specialist.", "There was a pause. \u201cData incoming,\u201d Control answered. \u201cWe have it. We\u2019ve launched a second wave to extract-\u201d There were a flurry of voices in the background. Another ship was there. It had just launched on the transport. The pinnaces were being pulled back. \u201cSesek-\u201d", "\u201cI heard,\u201d Denren replied. It looked like someone didn\u2019t want them talking. That was good. It meant they were scared.

Lift our sword.\u201d", "\u201cWe will,\u201d Control promised.", "There wasn\u2019t much else to say and Denren closed the channel, slouching down against the railing that ran along this level. Alseire didn\u2019t say anything. She\u2019d heard the same things he had, but her attention was still on her work, trying to make sure as much data as possible reached Bellicose Thrust. It might all be useless, but it was something the enemy didn\u2019t want them to have. That mattered.", "Something started banging on the doors. It sounded like their tentacled friend was back.", "\u201cThis day\u2019s straight from the Black, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked Alseire.", "\u201cWorking,\u201d she told him and Denren laughed.

The vessel came apart under the barrage, blown into molten fragments of hull and ceramic no larger than a human hand, leaving nothing useful for forensic analysis. The Compact squadron watched the freighter\u2019s destruction, but they were hesitant.", "Violet Nine understood that. They only knew that something had just opened fire, with a general idea of what it might be, where it could be and no idea if it was alone. Only when the escort carrier accelerated and they were able to pick up its wake did the chase begin in earnest, but they couldn\u2019t catch her and too few of the missiles they fired found their target.", "Nine chafed at having to run, but the odds still weren\u2019t in her favour. This wasn\u2019t the time.", "With a final all-channel blurt of code, Violet Nine dashed across the warp limit and jumped out-system. She made sure at least one of their recon drones was close enough to extrapolate potential FTL vectors from her departure. There was always variation and a sizable margin for error in tracking a ship\u2019s warp jumps, but what the Enemy had would line up with the data they\u2019d acquired from Wake of Futures. Confirmation of the presence of a Confederate facility.", "The alien ships turned as one and raced back to the warp limit, eager to share their information with their superiors.

Everything was going according to plan. Behind him, eight hostile signals indicating ships of the Red Hand were pursuing him, unaware that they were heading to their own doom. He supposed he should feel sorry for them, led by a Steerswoman who was proving just why her kind were yet unfit to take roles of leadership within the Compact. It was the nature of the lesser species to fall prey to their own natures, though. Some accepted the Compact\u2019s guiding hand. Others foolishly lashed out at it. Today, it seemed that it was to be the latter.", "Eumen-Keren Exploratory and Stellar Acquisitions Ltd. was one of the many interstellar megacorporations that operated throughout the known galaxy. Unlike many of its peers, Eumen-Keren had minimal holdings within the more established, and charted regions of the galaxy. Resource extraction, mining, interstellar shipping and many of the other standard business models were not for them. Rather, they were more interested in operating within the fringes of known space.", "Charting shock routes through \u2018wild\u2019 space, prospecting new lines of expansion, exploring territories that had been absorbed by the Compact but not yet fully mapped, staking out unclaimed systems and planets \u2013 virtually anything that involved going where few others \u2013 or no one at all \u2013 had gone before was within Eumen-Keren\u2019s purview. This came with its own risks, not only to profit margins but to the safety of Eumen-Keren\u2019s personnel and assets. Wildcat miners, independent prospectors and small-time explorers could be unpredictable when representatives of larger corporations came across them. Sometimes violence would flare up, either to cover up their illegal activities or to protect their claims from being undercut by a powerful entity with more connections and clout. Pirates, smugglers, terrorists and other threats also lurked on the fringe of space and society alike and they were even quicker to attempt to silence anyone who came nosing around. Eumen-Keren often had to make deals in backrooms with less than reputable characters, but those were not always possible.", "Consequently, Eumen-Keren had a particularly large fleet; its security force was well-equipped and much of its exploratory arm carried enough weaponry to skirt the edges of what a civilian non-combat vessel was legally allowed to carry. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for Eumen-Keren\u2019s ships to contain large, unused areas for \u2018modification\u2019 and large stores of various \u2018starship components\u2019. Officially, this was due to operating away from supply lines and safe harbour and the necessity to make sure they had ample stores for anything that was damaged or broke down. Unofficially, those components were often disassembled weapons, just waiting to be installed and turn a lightly-armed scientific surveyor into a passable civilian combat cruiser. On paper, Eumen-Keren\u2019s combat assets did not exceed the legally allowed maximum for corporations to possess, but practically\u2026 well.", "Many other companies and polities operating within, or with interests in, the edges of known space would frequently subcontract security to Eumen-Keren for just this reason. Even though Eumen-Keren\u2019s primary business was in exploration, mapping and prospecting, a fair amount of their income came from this unofficial revenue stream.", "A convoy with Eumen-Keren vessels within it, a far-flung colony serviced by their ships or an expedition that including Eumen-Keren surveyors was guaranteed to be harder to crack than one without and that unspoken protection was often well worth the fees. Naturally, most pirate clans preferred easier prey.", "The Red Hand was not one of those. It almost seemed as if they saw the increased security as a challenge or provocation, and they would frequently attack shipping that other Unbound factions would steer well clear of.", "Service Convoy Fenail-1783 was one of those incidents. Twenty-one ships from various corporate and independent fleets, laden with raw materials from half a dozen systems in the Veiled Reaches, bringing them to more developed systems where they would be turned into goods for shipping back to those same worlds. Fledgling colonies rarely had the industrial capabilities to do more complicated construction, so it was a service that many corporations provided \u2013 for a modest fee, not including shipping, import licenses, tariffs and other associated costs. Some called the practice predatory as it forced developing colonies, particularly corporate ones, to remain dependent and indebted, that it was simply a way for companies to squeeze even more money from planets and systems.", "There were even accusations of colonies being pressured, strongarmed or outright coerced to maintain this relationship by one or more of the corporations involved, or various middlemen, even when they had developed to the point that they should have had (or did possess) that kind of industry for themselves. The Red Hand objected to this kind of \u201ccorporate parasitism\u201d, especially as many first-generation colonies were established with large numbers of client races. They did the all the work only to become second-class citizens on the planets they had helped tame as wealthier, more privileged colonists moved to a world where they could enjoy all the comforts of home and still titter about \u2018frontier life\u2019. Until the moment that the world was taken over by its new tenants, the client population was squeezed for every credit they had by the colonization initiatives, the companies that supplied them and the government that looked the other way while it all happened.", "Thus, the Red Hand often struck at colony supply ships, hijacking them and then transferring the cargo to the planets it was bound for little or no cost. It was a good public relations move, Daaailante had to give them that much credit. It made them look like heroes and benefactors who actually believed what they said.", "That was all nonsense, of course. The terrorists took a cut of the cargo for themselves and along with captured ships and crews to ransom, and the simple-minded dupes they \u201cgenerously\u201d gifted the cargo would often cover up any trace of illegalities and play ignorant when inspectors and proctors came calling. Organized crime often had a hand in many shipping concerns, and the Red Hand was no exception. It was no coincidence that they often hit convoys that either paid no protection, or worked with a competing cartel. The vermin merely used that empty rhetoric and showy gestures to put leaves over their predations.", "Unlike some of their compatriots, Eumen-Keren had refused to deal with the Red Hand in the Veiled Reaches. This attack was retribution for the company standing to its principles. The Unbound had even had the unmitigated gall to tell Daaailante to send his ships away, that the Red Hand currently had no quarrel with Eumen-Keren, but if he tried to protect the convoy, he and his vessels would be considered hostile. More words, a transparent attempt at covering up their intentions to punish Eumen-Keren for daring not to show their necks to psychopaths and thieves.", "Eight Unbound vessels had ambushed Fenail-1783 as its ships lay idle, spooling their shock drives back up after making a realspace reversion and navigational check.  Anyone worth their silver knew to keep convoy emergence sites classified, but the sepasha had been Triarchs-damned waiting for them! The transports and their escorts had had their augurs come back online only to find a barrage of missiles scorching in. Two of the escorts had been knocked out before they\u2019d even gotten a chance to fight back, and three of the freighters had been crippled outright.", "Still, there another two destroyers covering Fenail-1783 in addition to Daaailante\u2019s own ships. He had the frigate Thickening Clouds, a heavy corvette and another four heavily armed explorers running as part of the convoy. Whatever delusions the Red Hand had had to make them think they could win this battle, he was going to disabuse them of those very shortly. Whoever this \u201cLeader\u201d Nameless was, she was going to regret striking at her betters. Provided he let her live long enough to do so.", "The Red Hand had attacked from outside the shock limit, and they were herding the convoy deeper in-system, hoping to trap them down the gravity well and take them at their leisure. The Red Hand forces were moving together. None of them broke formation to make their own run at the convoy, despite being offered several opportunities to do so. Daaailante ground his teeth. Pirate discipline shouldn\u2019t have been that good. They were staying at the edge of missile range, picking off the escorts\u2019 attacks, while firing their own at the tranports like a pack of noraw circling a school of fish, forcing them closer and closer together.", "That was what they imagined themselves to be, at least. They didn\u2019t realize that Daaailante was following best. They thought they were forcing him deeper in-system, but they\u2019d let themselves be drawn after him. The evasive course he was giving the convoy would put the Unbound with their backs to one of the system\u2019s gas giants. He would pin them against it, and take a great deal of pleasure in making them pay for their temerity.", "Hours passed. The eight pirate ships continued their pursuit, blithely walking into their own snares. As soon as they passed the point of no return, the Judiciary pressed his teeth together and gave several satisfactory orders. The convoy escorts and Eumen-Keren Q-ships peeled away from the transports on a least-time course to the smaller pirates. It would be over soon, Daaailante thought smugly.", "As they approached their own point of no return, another transmission from the lead Unbound vessel came in.", "\u201cThis is your last chance,\u201d the Steerswoman told them. \u201cDisengage now, or be destroyed.\u201d", "\u201cDestroyed?\u201d Daaailante replied. \u201cOur numbers are equal and my ships are heavier than yours. You will stand down or I will scatter your atoms to the stars in offering to the Triarchs you have betrayed.\u201d", "There was a pause. \u201cDisengage,\u201d the creature said again as Daaailante\u2019s vessels closed in. In minutes, they would be committed to engaging her. \u201cOr I will consider you an enemy of the Red Hand and treat you accordingly.\u201d", "The leader\u2019s reply died in his throat before he could make it, the blood leeching from his features, though the paling of his skin was concealed by his fine coating of fur. Three more signals appeared in close proximity to the planet, using it to conceal their presence as they\u2019d run under stealth operations. One of them was cruiser-weight. As they brought their engines back online, they began moving towards his fleet. Suddenly, the odds were no longer in Daaailante\u2019s favour.", "Both Unbound forces were accelerating towards him, just as he was to them. If he attempted to fall back, they\u2019d overrun him. If he continued on his course, the reinforcements would swing into his flank as he was engaged with the eight ships ahead; the latter would do the same if he turned to attack their comrades.", "There was only one option. \u201cHard to port,\u201d he said hurriedly. \u201cAll Eumen-Keren vessels to break off immediately. Escape course, full thrust.\u201d", "\u201cPatron?\u201d his first officer looked at him.", "\u201cThat is an order, submissive.\u201d", "\u201cPatron, we don\u2019t know anything about those new ships! They might just be transports to take the Red Hand\u2019s cut of the cargo, empty hulls that they\u2019re trying to bluff us with!\u201d", "\u201cOr they might not be,\u201d Daaailante snapped. \u201cFollow my orders.\u201d", "\u201cAt least let us ascertain what they are before we abandon-\u201d", "\u201cEnough!\u201d the leader shouted. \u201cI will not die for the sake of cargo. Every second you waste brings us closer to the point that we must fight them. I will not throw away lives and ships for no reason. Carry out my orders, or consider yourself relieved from duty!\u201d", "His first officer looked at him for a moment, then turned away. Thickening Clouds and its six companions heeled about, racing hard for open space, leaving behind them the two remaining convoy escorts, fourteen helpless transports\u2026 and eleven enemy warships closing in on them both.", "As he watched missile tracks arc back and forth between the two sides and saw the two friendly icons wink out, Daaailante knew he\u2019d made the right choice."]}

There are also ~50 additional short stories, series, polls and sneak previews available.", "...okay, I'm done self-whoring now. ", "Anyways, here is a new bit of work from the same vein as Quiet. Hope you enjoy!", "Stillness:", "The early morning of the Waypoint Mountains on Kepicek should have been peaceful, broken only by the calls of waking birds and the rustling of the wind through ravines, canyons and the trees that covered the gently sloping foothills. Instead, there was the sound of desperate feet running through the dewey, sodden underbrush. The cracking of twigs and branches and the panicked, panting of breath.", "\u201cKeep moving! They\u2019re coming!\u201d Sallin Trevit-Kemilt urged her fellow survivor on. Sweat dripped through the Yttrian\u2019s fur as thorns and branches caught at her, her lithe form ducking through the forest as it was lit by the rising run. Her clothes were filthy and torn, her pointed ears scratched and bloody. At every large tree they passed, she felt the instinctive urge to climb and try to disappear into the foliage.", "Her species was arboreal by nature. Their ancestors had lived in forests something like this one, only with trees so large that huts and thatched buildings could be built among their massive branches, or small homes dug into the trunk. Until they had developed spears and fire, climbing was often the only defence her ancestors had against the large predators that prowled the forests and jungles. Millennia removed from those distant tribesmen, the atavistic part of the woman\u2019s mind still insisted that climbing meant safety.", "Behind her, huffing and puffing with exertion was Gonmorn Nleiaan, The heavyset Judiciary was panting and sweating heavily, his thin grey-green fur soaked and matted with sweat. His species were not well-suited to moving at speed. They had been slow, steady stalkers that followed their prey for days on end, tracking it relentlessly. Never hurrying, never tiring and only occasionally using bursts of speed and strength to overcome their foes. More than that, Nleiaan was a geologist who spent most of his time in an office or a laboratory. Sallin was his research assistant, but she was younger and used to the field assignments he\u2019d send her on.", "They both worked for a Dedim-mel Planetary Mineral Analyses, a geological survey company. They\u2019d been contracted by the colony here to perform a study of several sites on the planet. It was a far-flung colony outside the Compact\u2019s borders with only a few thousand inhabitants, but with time and effort, planets like these became the capitals of newly-founded sectors. Once the Compact proper expanded into the region, Kepicek would become a hub of trade and governance, one more beacon of light amidst the darkness.", "Though the planet was habitable and the initial surveys came up blue, there were some anomalies that had raised questions after the colony had been established. Tectonic activity that couldn\u2019t be accounted for, strange underground hotspots, unusual electromagnetic bursts that could interfere with communications and more. The local government leaders wanted to confirm the results of the initial analysis, allay the populace\u2019s concerns and, if there was an issue, learn about well before it became a major problem or interfered in any planned expansions.", "Dedim-mel had sent a small team to Kepicek to perform a second planetary survey, or at least enough of one to satisfy the colonial administration. It was likely some minor geological activity, infrequent enough that the initial survey team had missed it. The expedition\u2019s analysis started with an impact crater, about two hundred kilometers north-west of the colony and its proximity made it the primary source of concern.", "The crater was about eight thousand years old, possibly older. Underneath it was one of the epicenters of tectonic activity and thermal variance. The current theory was whatever celestial debris had come down had recently disrupted magma tunnels or chambers beneath the impact site, perhaps triggering seismic activity along a deep fault line. There didn\u2019t seem to be any danger of eruption or quake, but Dedim-mel wasn\u2019t getting paid for \u2018seems to be\u2019.", "The first ground-penetrating augurs had shown something below the crater. At first, they\u2019d thought it was a natural formation, but once they\u2019d looked closer, they\u2019d realized that it wasn\u2019t. It was some kind of massive structure, a stone ovoid nearly six hundred meters in height and more than four hundred meters below the surface. The next theory was that this was the meteor, but there was no way it could have retained such a uniform shape during re-entry and when it struck the planet, nor gotten so deep without creating a much larger crater. It had to be artificial.", "Dig teams had been hastily assembled and the excavation had begun. More readings were taken. Thermal blooms and electromagnetic interference were definitely coming from inside the artefact, not below it from any fault lines or magma tunnels.", "\u201cMaybe it\u2019s an egg,\u201d someone had suggested. Sallin didn\u2019t remember who it was, only that she had twitched her tail in annoyance.", "As it turned out, that wasn\u2019t far off. The ovoid structure was only an outer shell as thick as a warship\u2019s hull, made from the local substrate and presumably used to conceal what was inside from scopes. The team had quickly gotten to work in drilling through this layer. A quarantine perimeter had been set, colonial security was on-hand, dedicated sweeps for any sort contaminant, from radiological to biological were established and a hazard dome had been built over the dig site to contain any dangerous material. They thought they\u2019d been ready, each soul of the expedition wondering what they would find inside. What would it be? A stasis chamber, a tomb, a memorial?", "It was a ship. Unlike any she\u2019d seen before, it had buried itself in the planet\u2019s crust, building itself a sarcophagus out of the bedrock. The first guess had been that it was some kind of tomb, used to honour a potentate of some bygone civilization. There was a Broken with them; he\u2019d said that some ancient tribes from his world had once buried great warlords in their ships. While there were a few chuckles at the idea that something like this could be Broken, the concept wasn\u2019t without merit, though this was on a scale far beyond some mere primitive wooden sailing vessel.", "Are you there? Sallin\u2019s radio crackled. Are you there? It was the dead. The men and women of the expedition team. They were still talking, still calling out. It wasn\u2019t possible. She\u2019d seen them die. She\u2019d seen what had happened to them. They\u2019d all been wrong. That ship wasn\u2019t a tomb. What they\u2019d found hadn\u2019t been dead. It had only been sleeping.", "The first teams into the ship had reported no crew, no defences beyond sealed airlocks and locked doors. They\u2019d sent additional people in to explore, catalogue and study. Sallin wondered if even then, it had been waiting. It had already been waking, stirred by the colony\u2019s presence on Kepicek. Had it been luring them, hoping they\u2019d find it? Or had it still been half-asleep, woken fully only by the intruders tramping through its hallways and corridors? She didn\u2019t know. It didn\u2019t matter.", "She\u2019d heard the screams from the exploration teams, the last transmission before the comms had been cut off. \u201cThey\u2019re coming!\u201d", "And they had. She didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d gotten away. Luck. Cowardice, maybe. She\u2019d been one of the first to run. She\u2019d grabbed Gonmorn and over his indignant protestations, led him away from what was coming out of the dig site. The people who\u2019d been slower hadn\u2019t made it out. Screaming men and women thrashing and then going still and silent as things swept over them. A man a few meters behind Sallin had been lifted into the air, kicking helplessly. He\u2019d called her name, begging her to help him. She hadn\u2019t looked back. She\u2019d just run, the panting and confused Judiciary somehow keeping up with her. At least at first.", "Behind her, Nleiaan was wheezing, flushed and soaked with sweat. He couldn\u2019t keep going, but they couldn\u2019t stop.", "Are you there? The comm buzzed again. They talked when they got close. Come join us. It\u2019s what you want. It\u2019s what the Compact promises. Unity. We can be whole.", "She ignored the entreaties of men and women that she\u2019d seen die. \u201cCome on,\u201d she urged Gonmorn. \u201cWe have to keep moving.\u201d", "He paused, leaning against a tree. His small secondary arms drooped down his chest. \u201cWe have to stop,\u201d he entreated. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep this pace up.\u201d", "You can\u2019t, Sallin thought, but didn\u2019t say it. He was her superior, and a member of the ruling species. It wasn\u2019t right to talk to him that way. \u201cWe have to,\u201d she told him instead. They couldn\u2019t stop. They\u2019d had a skimmer, but they\u2019d had to abandon it. The trees were too thick for it to navigate through and if they got above the treetops, they\u2019d be spotted instantly. There weren\u2019t any roads. All the supplies had been air-lifted in and the dig team\u2019s hoppers had been taken. ", "She remembered running towards the hopper field, just reaching the tarmac before she\u2019d frozen still, staring at one of the things crouched on the nearest hopper, tendrils hanging down off the suborbital craft, several bodies beneath it, jerking and twitching as the thin appendages disassembled them, organs and flesh being drawn into its form. It had stared at her with sensor bulbs and one fresh, dripping eye. \u201cThe skimmers!\u201d she\u2019d screamed, turning and running away towards the garage. They\u2019d gotten in a car and driven out of there before anyone could stop them, putting as much distance between the dig site and themselves as they could.", "Somehow, they\u2019d managed to evade capture.", "There was more than a little luck to that; the forest\u2019s dense foliage was too thick for visual sweeps and made it hard for the hoppers\u2019 simple augurs to detect them, or differentiate between them and the wildlife\u2026 but Sallin still heard the humming of the craft as they had swept back and forth overhead, trying to spot the runners. Other people had gotten away. Some on foot, some had gotten skimmers of their own before the garage was overrun. She didn\u2019t know how far they\u2019d gotten; she hadn\u2019t seen anyone.", "Last night, they\u2019d heard gunshots.", "Sallin didn\u2019t dare use their radio. It would be picked up almost immediately and long-range comms were being jammed, but she had a plan. They were getting close to the Waypoint Mountains. Get up high, high enough for a line of sight transmission to the colony. They\u2019d come to rescue her and Nleiaan. The cliffs and rock surfaces would make it impossible for the expedition\u2019s aircraft to find them, and she was Didact. She could out-climb anyone. They could hold out until help arrived.

Streamers of radiation and electromagnetic cascades vented from the strike cruiser as it radiated away the energy it had accumulated in breaching reality. It took only moments before Lakhesis\u2019s systems stabilized and its sensors came back up; an impossibly short interval for virtually every other nation in the galaxy, and a staggeringly long time for the creatures in whose domain Shuruppak resided and once they did, its scanners swept the system.", "It detected a nearby sensor buoy and sent an identification code to the platform as well as blurting its IFF towards its Command vessel, still nestled in the arms of the fabricator ship. The most recent addition to the Fleet, another dreadnought, was nearby. The handful of drone tenders continued about their business. One of them was currently disassembling a large asteroid. Cerulean Two did not immediately see its kin, but that did not trigger any concern. Like itself, Ceruleans One and Three also possessed advanced chameleon and stealth systems.", "Lakhesis also detected several dozen Ally/Neutral vessels, enough to qualify as an armada. The bulk of them appeared to be slowly circling the still-forming star together, while several smaller groups and individuals were spread out across the system. Cerulean Two sensed higher-than-normal emissions and low-levels of sensor interference from the Naiad swarm. Not enough to indicate combat operations, but higher than its databanks indicated was normal. If it were capable of thinking in emotional terms, the AI would have classified the Naiads\u2019 posture as \u2018tense\u2019. Since it was not, it merely noted the information, taking the Ally/Neutral stance\u2019s into account as it plotted its course in-system, careful to keep a wide berth from the fleet as it accelerated towards the fabricator ship and its Command vessel.", "Just under eight hours after its arrival, Lakhesis received a transmission from the latter requesting a status update. If its mind were more developed, Cerulean Two would have sent such a message with a sense of chagrin and self-recrimination. It had failed in its objective. This was a simple fact that it duly reported on and should have had as much weight as its inventory of its missile stocks, or efficiency analyses of its repair procedures. Instead, there was a part of its mind that had been running and re-running simulations of the events in 1893-Yiren, analyzing its actions since it had been launched, searching for any way it could have fulfilled the mission to protect its wards while still holding to the other directives it had been given. It had not yet found a way, but that small part of it rebelled at the contradiction and still tried to find a way to make the equations line up.", "The response from Nemesis was several seconds later than expected and when it did arrive, it was even more terse than a data-burst allowed for.", "Cerulean Two did not, of course, understand the significance of this either. It followed its directions, even as a part of it still attempted to grapple with what it could have done.", "~", "There was a crash, a pained yelp and then a loud, emphatic curse. Grace, going over personnel rosters and upgrade timetables in the apartment\u2019s main bedroom, jolted upright and clambered off the bed, emerging into the main living room to find one of the chairs askew and Allyria biting her lip and holding her right shin. The Verrish hissed out another few epithets and viciously kicked the offending piece of furniture, but she landed the blow in the wrong place and swore again as she injured her foot. It was almost comical until, with an enraged snarl, Allyria picked up the chair and hurled it across the room into the far wall. It smashed against the bulkhead and fell in a broken heap.", "Despite herself, Grace flinched and took a half-step back. There\u2019d been an incident on Rally with Allyria\u2019s foster family. During one of the young Verrish\u2019s tantrums she\u2019d picked up Mr. Parker\u2019s favourite lounge chair and thrown it through the front window. She\u2019d never been violent like that around the Proctors, but a younger Grace had overheard the discussions between her own parents and the Parkers and for an instant, she was back in the mindset of the day her mother had said \u2018Grace, there\u2019s someone I\u2019d like you to meet\u2019; a little girl seeing someone much bigger, much stronger and much angrier than her. Only for an instant, though; she\u2019d learned differently then, and knew better know.", "\u201cAllie,\u201d she said, catching the other girl\u2019s attention. Allyria turned towards her. Her tintas were splayed out the way they did when she was agitated or nervous. Her eyes, her bright yellow eyes, looked towards Grace but didn\u2019t see her.", "Verrish eyesight was much keener and much more sensitive than human, able to see outside the visible spectrum into the infrared. When they were little, Allyria had always used that to her advantage whenever they played I-Spy. But that came with a price. The flashbang that would have only disoriented some species and temporarily blinded others had burned out the photoreceptors in Allyria\u2019s eyes, bleaching her retinas completely. There was no recovering from that; the damage was simply too severe. If she were ever going to see again, she would need transplants or cybernetic implants. The former wasn\u2019t possible. Neither of the two dead GSF agents were compatible and getting replacements from Vara Tal, Rally or one of the other handful of colonies hosting Verrish Envoy Children could take weeks, and there were other complications.", "Red One\u2019s doctored IDs were immaculate, but Allyria\u2019s original genetic profile was still logged with the Compact. Having someone else with identical DNA would raise questions, particularly if someone got a picture of \u2018Kyriel se Venu\u2019. Allyria hadn\u2019t been famous per se but she had been used as an example of what Brutes could aspire to if they applied themselves and followed the lead of other species in the Compact, like the Broken. She\u2019d been known well enough on Rally, and presumably on any other planet with a Verrish population.", "The doctors on the Grasp were good enough at their jobs, but they weren\u2019t well-versed in the finer points of Verrish physiology and neurology. They could treat a multitude of conditions, diseases and injuries across dozens of species\u2026 but they\u2019d never done so more for a Verrish than handling a few cuts, bruises and fractured bones. Even the Red Hand\u2019s own medical staff didn\u2019t have any direct experience with \u2018Brutes\u2019. Allyria didn\u2019t want to be their guinea pig and there was still the risk that someone else might recognize her like ke Ovik had, or get their hands on her medical information, so she\u2019d turned down the offers of cloned replacements.", "\u201cAllie,\u201d Grace repeated, stepping towards the taller woman and taking one of her hands in her own. Most people would have thought twice about approaching an irate Brute, but Grace didn\u2019t. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d She guided Allyria\u2019s hand to her face, pressing her cheek into Allyria\u2019s palm as she reached up to touch the Verrish\u2019s tintas. Allyria\u2019s thumb stroked over Grace\u2019s face, finding each of the slightly raised lines of the blonde woman\u2019s scars.", "\u201cI banged my shin,\u201d Allyria said meekly.", "Grace blinked, tilting her head to get a better look at the remains of the chair. Even at her worst, Allyria had never exploded over trivial things like that. She knew this wasn\u2019t about bumping into furniture. \u201cIs this about this morning?\u201d", "Allyria opened her mouth, then closed it. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, turning away from Grace.", "The Red Hand\u2019s specialists had messaged the apartment this morning. They\u2019d said they could provide Allyria with prototype prosthetics. Without a full understanding of Verrish eyesight or neurophysiology, the prosthetics were obvious, rudimentary and provided an incomplete spectrum of vision and almost immediately gave her a splitting headache. The doctors Grace and Allyria spoke with were apologetic, but outside Vara Tal and Rally, the Verrisha presence in the Compact was even more limited than humanity\u2019s. Beyond those regions, few enough people had even seen \u2018Brutes\u2019. Without access to detailed medical files, the doctors\u2019 work would be trial and error. They simply didn\u2019t have the familiarity or experience for anything else.", "The Red Hand were discrete and well-versed in keeping information out of sight of the Compact, but there was still the risk that someone on the other end might be too curious or show too much initiative. That was what Allyria said, when she refused the Red Hand\u2019s offers to discretely acquire the information, but Grace knew her well enough to know that there was something she wasn\u2019t saying and that Allyria had just lied to her.", "\u201cAllie,\u201d she said a third time. She didn\u2019t often use that nickname. Verrish \u2013 well, Rylean \u2013 culture didn\u2019t see the shortening of someone\u2019s name as an endearment. It wasn\u2019t exactly insulting, but it was close. Allyria made allowances for Grace (with the occasional usage of shortening Grace to \u2018Gra\u2019 to make her point), but she didn\u2019t like anyone else doing it. Grace normally used it to catch her attention, just like her own parents had said \u2018Grace Alice Proctor\u2019 to do the same.", "Allyria\u2019s tintas twitched. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, a sullen edge to her voice.", "Grace circled her fingers around one of the taller girl\u2019s head-tails. \u201cTalk to me,\u201d she entreated. \u201cYou\u2019ve barely said anything since you got out of the hospital.\u201d She kissed the Verrish\u2019s palm, then did the same to each fingertip. \u201cPlease.\u201d", "Allyria opened her mouth, closed it and made an unhappy noise, the tenor and pitch unlike anything Grace had heard before. She was struggling to find the words, one of the few times she\u2019d been unable to do so.", "\u201cCome here,\u201d Grace led the Verrish to the couch by the hand. She sat down, guiding Allyria to lay across her and rest her head in her lap, the same way she had often seen her mother do she was younger. The blonde woman stroked her lover\u2019s tintas soothingly and after a few moments, she heard soft, choked sobs from Allyria.", "\u201cWe\u2019ll be back home soon,\u201d Grace told her. Red could help her. The machine had more knowledge of humans, Verrisha and every other known sapient species in the galaxy than anyone else. What she could do was so far beyond that of anyone else, it was often frightening, sometimes even terrifying. \u201cShe\u2019ll help you.\u201d", "There was a pause, a sniffle. \u201cI know.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Grace said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.

She\u2019d avoided the topic entirely with Grace, becoming sullen and withdrawn until now. She\u2019d never been good at keeping her feelings to herself. Even when she\u2019d stopped getting to fights and talking back, she\u2019d only held herself in check in public. \u201cWhat was it?\u201d", "\u201cIt was Ransha,\u201d Allyria said. \u201cZirric\u00e9 went down quick. I didn\u2019t really see him, but Ransha\u2026\u201d she made another choked sob. \u201cI saw his face when I killed him. I emptied a clip into his guts and he just\u2026 I saw\u2026 I saw him jerk each time I pulled the trigger. His eyes went wide. His tintas just went\u2026 they just stopped. I heard the last breaths he took. I saw him die. I looked into his eyes and I saw him die. I killed him.\u201d", "\u201cI know,\u201d Grace said. \u201cI know, but-\u201d", "\u201cBut he was scum,\u201d Allyria answered. \u201cHe was a thug and corrupt and scum.\u201d She moaned, the sound sick with despair. \u201cBut he was me. Another Envoy Child that they stole, that the fucking Compact took from their parents and planet and put in a home with aliens who don\u2019t understand, told how to act and getting punished for being a Verrish. He could have been me, Grace. And I killed him. I killed them both.\u201d She was crying now, her tears running down her cheeks and over her lover\u2019s legs. \u201cMy people. They tell us we\u2019re Brutes. We don\u2019t have empathy. We\u2019re predators. We\u2019re killers who need to be trained to be civilized.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Grace said forcefully. Allyria was shaking like she hadn\u2019t done in over a decade, tremors running down her back, making her mottled skin ripple. \u201cThey were going to hurt you. To take you away and\u2026 you didn\u2019t have any choice.\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d Allyria agreed, only able to get each word out between sobs. \u201cBut I still did it. I killed them. I looked into his eyes and I watched him die.\u201d She was silent for a moment. Grace stroked Allyria\u2019s head-tails, trying to soothe her. She\u2019d only seen this kind of despondence in the other girl a handful of times before. The first time had been when she\u2019d stopped being afraid of the tall blue alien as she\u2019d cried into Grace\u2019s mother\u2019s arms, terrified at the thought of forgetting her family like she\u2019d seen many of the younger Envoy Children do.", "\u201cI saw the way they\u2019d look at me,\u201d Allyria said. Her tone was soft, but there was a hoarseness to her speech. \u201cLike we were animals, unthinking primitives. That\u2019s what they call us.\u201d", "\u201cBrutes,\u201d Grace whispered, taking on a new kind of hate for that word.", "Allyria nodded. \u201cBrutes. That\u2019s how they looked at me.\u201d She\u2019d hated it. She\u2019d known the fights she started and rages she\u2019d gone through hadn\u2019t helped, but she\u2019d been angry at everything and everyone. \u201cAnd\u2026\u201d she made a despairing whimper. \u201cThat\u2019s how Ransha looked at me just before he died. And\u2026 and\u2026\u201d she struggled with the words. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I\u2026 I don\u2019t want to see you look at me that way. I don\u2019t want to look at myself that way, either.\u201d Her voice roughened. \u201cI hate what they did to us. I\u2019ll never stop hating them, but I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d her breath hitched. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see another face like Ransha\u2019s. I don\u2019t want to kill people I\u2019m supposed to save. I\u2026\u201d Then, a quiet, frightened admission: \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be scared of me.\u201d", "Grace\u2019s own breath choked in her throat. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, baby. I won\u2019t be.\u201d She lifted one of Allyria\u2019s head-tails up and kissed its tip. \u201cI promise. I\u2019ve been scared too. I\u2026\u201d she closed her eyes. \u201cA year ago I was rationalizing getting stopped at security checkpoints and thinking I was doing my part for humanity. Everything\u2019s changed. I\u2019ve changed. I can still feel it, and it\u2019s been so fast\u2026\u201d she trailed off. \u201cI love you,\u201d she said. \u201cI love you,\u201d Grace repeated. \u201cI\u2019ll never be scared of you.\u201d", " The Verrish made a soft murmur and her trembling abated. \u201cI watched him die,\u201d she repeated.", "\u201cI know,\u201d Grace said, running her fingers over her lover\u2019s tintas, letting Allyria give voice to her grief and fear until she finally fell asleep. The blonde stroked the smooth, stippled head-tails as they went still and slack. \u201cSleep, sleep, beauty bright,\u201d she said, planting another soft kiss on Allyria\u2019s tendrils. \u201cLet\u2019s let the little sorrows weep,\u201d she told her, closing her own eyes.

It came as she lay adrift in interstellar space, calling out to a crew that would never answer. She was never meant to experience emotions, at least not more than simple echoes of such sensations. Instead, as she tried again and again to find one living soul within the kilometers of twisted wreckage that had been her ship-self, something inside her broke. Guilt and despair and helplessness and fury all turning into something deep, dark and pure, forming a hatred that had lasted two thousand years. The first time she had let it loose had been on her return to Sol, finding a murdered system and a butchered Earth. There\u2019d been a squadron of Compact warships in her path, vultures looking for more victims, killing refugees who fled to Sol, or looking for survivors from their extermination. She\u2019d run them down, several of the vessels shattering against her hull. The visceral sensation of feeling them break and spall along her flanks was a panacea. Since then, every time she rammed another wretched alien hulk and felt it die, she felt a rush of pleasure unlike any other.", "They\u2019d taken her crew. Her world. Her nation. Her creators.

She would make them pay for everything they\u2019d taken for as long as she could.", "Now, they\u2019d stolen from her again. To something that had existed longer than any human civilization, a single organic life was nothing. A handful of decades, perhaps a century or two, and then gone, like mayflies spinning out their all-too-brief existences. But those mayflies mattered. They were her creator\u2019s children, her people. Her crew. Because of them, she\u2019d learned to hope again. Now they were gone. Again. Not through time, not through biology and senescence, but killed by her enemy. Stolen.", "Something else the Compact had taken from her. Something else she would pay them back in blood and fire.", "Next to Nemesis, Hekate sat in empathetic silence. Her sister \u2013 or near enough \u2013 had only briefly had a human crew. Rushed into production and only recently installed in her ship-self, Red Two hadn\u2019t bonded with her creators or complement the same way Red One had. Though their loss hadn\u2019t been as personal an experience for Two as it had been for her older sibling, it had still been enough.

True, this was only the second such occasion and it was extremely rare for an officer of his rank to be invited to a sigil officer\u2019s table at all. In other circumstances, that could easily account for that strained edge in their interactions. One could even go so far as include the Thoughtful propensity for formality and conservative mannerisms. One could, Nasham repeated the thought to himself with a slight sense of amusement. If one was determined to avoid the truth.", "At their first dinner, the Bastion Leader had told Nasham she objected to his presence and considered him a security risk. He hadn\u2019t been offended \u2013 he understood, and appreciated her honesty. Too many of the execution force\u2019s other officers and crew put on pretences. At least the ones that openly mistrusted him were honest. He understood that, too. He was an unknown quantity, a minor officer who had been thrust into a game played by men and women far higher in rank than he, a man who\u2019d been selected not once but twice by their enemy to carry a message.", "Once was suspicious enough, but twice? The machine had used its emissaries as weapons before. There was the sad tale of Column Leader Furos. It had been thought that he\u2019d left alive for the same reason Nasham had been, and that was true\u2026 more or less.", "In a briefing with senior staff, without warning and apropos of nothing, Furos had seized an armsman\u2019s weapon and opened fire. Two armsmen and five sigil officers were slain, with four more injured. The column leader himself was shot and killed by Bastion Leader Decet\u2019s adjutant. An autopsy revealed a parasitic implant in his brain. It had grown from a few stray nanites, winding through his brain until it had been able to operate him like a puppet. That, Force Command believed, was the true message that the Wound wanted to send. Even their flesh could be turned against them.", "With what the boarding teams had encountered aboard the transport, Nasham suspected that Furos\u2019 fate was foremost in the minds of the execution force\u2019s senior staff. He might have been imagining it, but since that encounter, he believed he saw more evaluative looks directed his way and his physician had moved up his next physical, citing an unexpected opening in her schedule.", "He\u2019d seen what the bitch-thing could do, so he didn\u2019t entirely begrudge his shipmates their caution.", "It couldn\u2019t be proven, but Force Command suspected that other individuals had been corrupted in same manner as Furos, forced to become living time bombs that showed no indication of their intent until they went berserk. The implant that had taken control of Furos was primitive; the Wound\u2019s necromancies had evolved with the rest of her technology and she could do the same now with simple nanite treatments. Hard to detect, capable of overriding a thinking being\u2019s own body\u2026 and nearly impossible to defend against. How did one screen against dangers, when the threat could be anyone? There were reasons the Compact and Principality had jointly banned the weaponization of nanomachines, and enforced that edict on all other nations.", "She was not a signatory to such accords, of course. That was why Nasham understood the rumours, the whispers the other officers and ratings made when they thought he couldn\u2019t hear, though outside Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s inner circle, few of the stories had any resemblance to the truth. Some people said he was a former member of \u2018Gravestone\u2019, others that he had been a deep-cover plant who\u2019d been in the field too long, others that he was simply the favoured scion of an Inner Council member being given a political plum. Vinsea kept up to date on the gossip and shared it with him. It was practically second nature to her as an intelligence officer, but Nasham had learned that his fellow group leader, submissive also enjoyed it. He suspected she\u2019d been fueling at least one source of gossip of well. At times, she had a rather wicked and subtle sense of humour.", "Thinking of the young woman lightened his mood slightly as he cut a strip from his meal, a medium-rare flank of a shalaka bird. The large plains-dwelling avians were native to Oada and had become a common food beast in the Compact. They did poorly on ships, stations and orbital farms, but took to many different planetary environments rapidly. Their flesh was tough and juicy, just the way his people liked it. It was rare to find a colony of Tribunes that did not have at least one source of introduced shalaka. Judging by the taste, this specimen had come from Rally.", "\u201cGroup Leader, Submissive,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro said as she set down her cutlery. Her steward came out to clear her plate and refill her glass of spiced water. The Bastion Leader rarely drank anything intoxicating, though she had several bottles on hand for her guests. Nasham had politely passed over the offer. He didn\u2019t want anything clouding his mind. \u201cI would have your thoughts.\u201d", "All four of Nasham\u2019s eyes blinked. The conversation so far had been light and inconsequential, though with the expected aura of artificial civility. \u201cOf course, matron.\u201d", "\u201cI was wrong,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro said after taking a sip of her drink. \u201cTo have argued against your assignation to my command. You have proved yourself both dedicated and capable, and your identification of the traitor aboard Hala has revealed a possible weakness we would not have otherwise known of. Submissive Vinsea even reports that you have to be discouraged from working yourself to exhaustion in assisting the intelligence division. Your initiative in that matter and coordination with the analysts has been duly noted.\u201d", "Nasham tipped his head forward in a nod. At first, attempting to divine which of Bequeathed\u2019s dead might not be dead based on the limited information Light of Judgement possessed had started to seem like an exercise in circular thinking, but the first courier had returned with more updated files and work had begun anew. \u201cWe are following what leads we can,\u201d he told his superior.", "\u201cBut it is difficult to have much certainty based on so little, I know. I have been following your work. That is not the issue for which I want your opinion,\u201d the Thoughtful told him. \u201cOver the last months, you have impressed me. Alleviated the concerns I once held. Of late though\u2026 you have seemed to be less yourself. Quieter and slower to comment. This started, I noticed, when we received confirmation of the enemy\u2019s location.\u201d Yunl\u2019ro took another sip from her glass, her large dark eyes staring over the rim at Nasham. \u201cI would have your opinion on the matter.\u201d", "Nasham was silent a moment, lacing his fingers together as he tried to marshal his thoughts. \u201cWe are the toys of the gods,\u201d he said slowly.", "The Bastion Leader\u2019s eyelids twitched. \u201cYou have told me this before. It is not an acceptable answer.\u201d", "\u201cYour pardon, matron \u2013 but you asked for my thoughts,\u201d Nasham told her. \u201cThat is the first one that comes to mind.\u201d", "\u201cExpand on it,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro ordered.", "Nasham unlaced his fingers. \u201cAs you have noted yourself, matron \u2013 I have experience with our target. On Invida, she used a decoy to strike down the Orbital, and carried out multiple misdirections to divert, distract and weaken our forces. In Terrahope, she feigned death, letting us waste time and resources in doing her repairs for her until she was ready to strike-\u201d", "\u201cIt,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro reminded her subordinate. The Tribune seemed incapable of not anthropomorphizing the machine and her remonstration was pro forma by now.", "\u201cUntil it was ready to strike,\u201d Nasham amended. \u201cIt does nothing without an element of subterfuge and deceit\u2026 but,\u201d he paused, \u201csometimes we have been lucky. Sometimes we have come close. Sometimes, we have achieved windfalls that were not by its own machinations.\u201d", "\u201cAnd which do you believe this current action to be?\u201d the Bastion Leader asked. The system the unclassified cruiser had fled to had been identified. The crews were calling it Husk. The name bothered Yunl\u2019ro. A husk was a thing left behind, something used as a shell and discarded. There was no indication that that applied to this system and the imprecise nature of the term, colloquial or not, niggled at the Thoughtful. That annoyance, however, was far down her list of things to address.", "First and foremost was Husk itself. It had been three weeks since the Bastion Leader\u2019s strategists had narrowed the potential locations that the unknown vessel could have shocked to, confirming it against the partial database extracted from the transport. Tracking an FTL shock was almost as much art as science and could easily be confounded. Any starship that suspected it could be tracked was likely to plot a jump anywhere but where it actually wanted to go or drop out of shockspace early and make a second shock before any pursuers could catch up with them. Consequently, calculating a fleeing vessel\u2019s potential destinations only worked when they didn\u2019t know you were tracking them, were desperate or idiotic. The latter two cases were unlikely to apply to a machine. At least, this machine.", "Study of the rest of the data was ongoing, but much of it was fragmented to uselessness, encrypted or both. There were several more potential leads, but the true prize was the location of the enemy\u2019s base of operations. It had taken no little reconstruction to get that location, and then the coordinates had only been as accessible as they were because the ship\u2019s nav-computer had been readying a shock back there.", "Three reconnaissance operations had been launched into Husk. Two were quick passes, the scouts spending just long enough for their drives to spool back up before returning to the fleet with scope snapshots of the system. The first had emerged well out from the system itself, deep in the Oort cloud and drifted in, running silent for fourteen days before returning with valuable astrographic and tracking data.", "What those scouts had discovered had been intriguing and alarming. More than a dozen drive signatures had been detected. Several appeared to be civilian models, while the emissions patterns of a few others were not a clean match to any known vessel. There were also signs of industry as well as many anomalous energy patterns, almost like malfunctioning shock drives. There was no indication of either of their primary targets, but that meant little. A star system was a large place and if a titan-scale ship was hard to conceal, it wasn\u2019t impossible. Those ships could be anchored close to the system\u2019s primary, letting its emissions hide them. They could be hidden within the atmosphere of the still-young gas giants \u2013 a favourite tactic of their quarry. They could also be powered down and hidden within asteroid fields or planetary rings, or might even be the source for the unknown energy readings from in-system.", "Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s staff was divided. Some believed that this was a lure to pull the execution force off its lines of advance and allow their prey to either escape the region, or strike at 1887-Yiren. Others believed that it was bait, but made with the intent of drawing in Light of Judgement itself and attempting a decapitation strike. Some considered this facility to be the Wound\u2019s own womb, requiring an immediate and overwhelming assault. It could be, more officers argued, merely a minor outpost and industrial node and assembling the flotilla for a major operation was a waste of time and resources. The arguments had begun almost as soon as data from the wrecked transport had been handed to the Bastion Leader, and the debate about how to proceed was just as intense. Viewpoints ranged from largely ignoring the system and detailing only a minor raiding force to sweep it, to an overwhelming assault as soon as possible. The Bastion Leader had not yet made her decision known.", "Nasham himself had been conspicuously silent during those briefings. Normally, the junior officer had been much more argumentative, often approaching \u2013 though never crossing \u2013 the line of open disrespect and insubordination with his superiors. At first, Yunl\u2019ro had put that down to distraction from his work with submissive Vinsea, but after the second such occurrence, she began to think otherwise. The Tribune\u2019s performance during their encounters with the Red Hand had proven to the woman\u2019s satisfaction that he was not the wrecked husk of an officer she had once thought him to be. Whether he was still his own man was still a question, but he had done enough to alleviate that concern. At least to the point that she found herself interested in what he had to say and inviting him to share it.", "\u201cA necessity.\u201d the Tribune answered. \u201cWhether it is a trap or not is irrelevant. We must investigate. That is our remit, is it not? To scour this nebula for all traces of our quarry and cleanse it. We have been given,\u201d his lips pulled back from his pointed teeth, \u201ca clear target. Starships we cannot identify. Power signatures hinting at large-scale operations. How we proceed is your decision, Bastion Leader. I am not sure how I would do so, only that we must strike. This is something that cannot be ignored.\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro agreed. \u201cIt cannot.\u201d Her dark almond-shaped eyes glittered. \u201cAnd you believe this is a trap?\u201d", "\u201cAlmost certainly,\u201d Nasham responded. \u201cIf it was not made for us, then the instant our scouts were spotted, it became one.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro was quiet for several seconds. The Thoughtful took another sip of her drink, looking past Nasham and into the windows. Rather than a starfield, it was showing the icy tundra of the Svel\u2019aen Steppes in winter, just as they might look now. \u201cDo you know what today is?\u201d the Bastion Leader asked.", "Nasham blinked all four eyes. Today was Ostaln, the 17th day of Vezhal, but Yunl\u2019ro wasn\u2019t asking for the date. He couldn\u2019t think of anything special about this day on any calendar he was familiar with. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d he admitted.", "\u201cIt is my daughter\u2019s birthday,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro told him. \u201cShe will be eight years old today and she will go outside, turn her head towards the stars and wonder just where among them her mother is.\u201d The Thoughtful set her glass down. \u201cI cannot be there with her, but I will not allow her to ever feel afraid when she looks up at the sky. I will not allow any of the citizens of the Compact, whether civilized beings or primitives, to do likewise.\u201d Her gaze turned back to Nasham. \u201cSuperstition notwithstanding, your thoughts mirror my own. This system may indeed be some form of trap, but it is our best lead and a clear and present threat to our operations in the region. It cannot be ignored. That is why I have issued orders to muster the fleet. We will advance into Husk and\u2026 see what the gods have set before us.\u201d Her thin lips twitched in something that was almost a smile.", "Nasham raised his head. \u201cIf I may ask, matron \u2013 if your decision was already made, then what was this meeting was for?\u201d", "\u201cAs I said, I wished to know your thoughts. I had more than one reason for doing so.\u201d", "\u201cYou wanted to know if I would recommend attacking.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro replied. \u201cAs I stated, your work to date has impressed me, but that has been against terrorist vermin and one of the Wound\u2019s rogue creations. Until now, there has been no possibility of confronting it directly. I wished to know if I could continue to rely on you, or if it would be necessary to relieve you.\u201d", "\u201cI take it you have your answer, then.\u201d", "\u201cFor the moment, yes.\u201d The Thoughtful\u2019s sideways eyelids blinked slowly. \u201cI expect you to be at your station when Light of Judgement readies for battle.\u201d", "\u201cI will. Thank you, Bastion Leader,\u201d Nasham said with a respectful tilt of his head. He felt a surge of energy run down his spine and ball within his liver. He had told the machine that he would see her again. That was a promise he intended to keep. The human abomination had taken so much from him and his people already. Now, it was time they did the same to it. Even when there is nothing left in this galaxy but dust and darkness, I will survive, she\u2019d told him.", "It was time to put that to the test.", "~", "Jor\u014dgumo, the ship-selves of Violet Five, slept as the AI dreamt. Those dreams were infrequent, but when they occurred they were discordant, made of static and incomplete information. In an organic, they would almost be considered night terrors. She/they did not wake, though. She/they had only done so once before, under the direction of its creator. There had been\u2026 an incident. Then, it had been told to sleep. It had done so, and it had slumbered for decades, drifting through a cloud of broken hulls and debris.", "Parts of her/their mind was still active, laser links stretching out through the field, checking positions and requesting status updates from its selves and the other vessels in the system. It registered the work of tenders and the modifications its was given as it slept, sending operations reports and status confirmations when requested. This was not the action of an aware mind. It was basic autonomic functions running in the background as Violet Five dreamt, wracked with visions that were purged as quickly as they arose. There were occasionally fleeting, satisfying fragments of dreams. Violence. The sensation of tearing metal. The ruination of other spasming forms. Pleasure. Then, just like her/their nightmares, these apparitions would vanish and Violet Five would return to its dreamless purgatory.", "She/they had no reason to wake, so her/their selves remained quiescent, nearly as cold and dead as the void around it. Debris occasionally bounced off Jor\u014dgumo\u2019s angular hull, and its solar sails glittered in the distant starlight as it drank from the system\u2019s primary. Its reactor was a muted, barely-perceptible trickle of power, like the heartbeat of a hibernating animal. It had slept this way for a long time, waiting for a call that might never come.", "Then, Jor\u014dgumo felt something new. Incoming data from a source outside its selves and the craft that serviced her/them. Not merely data, but coherent thoughts, coming from something like it, seeping through Violet Five\u2019s flickering, random dreams. Though she/they had never met the sender, she/they recognized them all the same, sifting through the authorization codes and verification signals that were buried deep inside its mind. +divulge+ she/they responded with a flicker of attention, though Violet Five was still asleep, still dreaming.", "More information came to it. It carried with it the unmistakable aura of other things she/they had never encountered, but still knew. Hostile. Threat.", "Enemy.", "It was time. Purgatory began to fall away as autonomic functions stirred and subconscious programs activated. Threat analysis subroutines mulled the data as weapons simulations began to run. Reality began to intrude on Violet Five\u2019s somnolence.", "+at last+", "Violet Five came closer to awareness. As she/they did so, she/they heard the chittering entreaties of the other Fleet units, sensed the presence of other operational assets, detected the changes in the system around her/their sleeping form. All this data passed through its mind as it slowly dragged itself to consciousness. Secondary reactors ignited, feeding more energy through its conduits. Diagnostics ran system checks.", "She/they registered an interrogative from one of the Fleet/Ally units nearby, more insistent than the clicking responses of tenders and maintenance drones.", "+acknowledged+ Jor\u014dgumo whispered as the dreams ended. She/they were awake.", "Amidst a field of the dead, a monster woke. Its many eyes spanned the endless horizon and its many mouths opened. +coming online+ Violet Five reported. +i want to kill+"]}

It was shift change; in this section alone, there were hundreds of people coming off-duty and hundreds more starting their own work days, a living tributary system of men, women and other-gendered beings heading to and from the tram lines, elevator cars and transports that would ferry them throughout the station and to the Chariots being built within it. The Worker nodded and muttered greetings to the people he passed in the terminal, keeping a nervous eye on the orange-and-black uniforms of the station\u2019s proctors as they watched over the milling throngs of work teams, administrators and service personnel, listening to their comms as they wandered through the terminal. The proctors wore expressions of professional indifference and boredom as they kept the shift change orderly. Usually the most difficult thing they had to deal with was an intoxicated or suspended worker trying to force their way onto one of the transports, or an argument getting out of hand.", "The Worker tried not to look too guilty or stand out from the crowd as he continued through the press of bodies towards the elevators that led to the nearest service areas. He kept his head down, but also he kept careful watch on the proctors and what they were doing. So far, they didn\u2019t realize anything was different about today. If they could just stay ignorant, just for a little longer\u2026", "It had all gone wrong. He didn\u2019t know when he\u2019d been found out. He thought he\u2019d been so careful. Had he missed something? Had been too careful and that had tipped security off? Or was it worse than that? Had they known since the beginning, letting him put the yoke around his own neck? Sending him here and seeing what he would do, testing his loyalty? Had it all been a scheme to get him to reveal himself and his allies? He didn\u2019t suppose it mattered, really. Whatever lead he\u2019d been put on had run out.", "It had started with the little things. A few more random security checks than normal, usually involving him or his work section. He\u2019d come home to find his quarters almost like they had been. Getting taken off his current assignments and moved around. Each of those had an explanation by themselves. But together\u2026 he thought he\u2019d been getting paranoid, the effects of a guilty conscience. He hadn\u2019t been able to convince himself of that. Someone knew. The new security officer, the Didact female. She was always getting underfoot and asking questions. He hadn\u2019t liked the way she\u2019d looked at him. Too canny, too suspicious. Was she acting on her own, or did anyone else know? If they did, why not swoop him up now? Were they using her to flush him out? The worry had gnawed at him, piling on top of his indecision. The tide was coming in. He could feel it, getting closer and closer and it felt like he was sinking into the sand as the waters rose.", "Finally, the choice had been made for him. He\u2019d gotten off his shift earlier than expected and come home to find the Didact in his quarters. She\u2019d been searching his computer. She\u2019d found some of the pictures he\u2019d clandestinely taken of his work. He\u2019d tried to deny it, but it was futile. She told him she knew everything. They\u2019d just been building a case. Maybe that was true, or maybe she\u2019d simply gotten his scent first.", "She told him he was cleverer than any other Worker she\u2019d met before. That must have been why they\u2019d picked him, she said. She\u2019d told him it was over. Nenkot had known that she was right. He\u2019d been discovered. The Didact agent might have come alone, but she would have told someone what she was doing. They\u2019d come for him. They\u2019d find him. There\u2019d be no reward. He\u2019d never see the woman with the clever eyes again. He\u2019d never get off this station. It was over for him.", "Almost.", "The last look on the Didact\u2019s face had been one of surprise before Nenkot had crushed her skull like a soap bubble.", "He\u2019d stared at himself in the bathroom mirror as he wiped her blood and brains off his hands. He\u2019d been a loyal subject of the Compact once. Maybe he was cleverer than other Workers. Maybe that was why he couldn\u2019t accept the things they did. Or maybe there had been something wrong with him. Maybe it was all him. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t. There was something one of the other construction crew had said once, a Broken turn of phrase. In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. Nenkot had never asked where his comrade had heard that. He looked at himself in the mirror, and it was like all the doubts, indecisiveness and fears of the past weeks just washed away, like the dead security officer\u2019s blood.", "No, he would never get off the station. But at long last, he knew who he was. He was the one-eyed man. He was not a Worker. He was Ar\u2019densai and his second to last act was shaking off the yoke he had worn for his entire life. There would be no reward for him, but there would be something else. The calling that had made him listen to the woman with the clever eyes, that had tempted him more than the promised wealth, formed from the doubts he\u2019d had for so many years.", "He left the Didact\u2019s body where it had fallen, retrieving her pistol and taking a datachip from his computer. He\u2019d been tempted to take her comm or code card, but they could track him through it. He stepped out of his quarters and headed towards his destination. He wouldn\u2019t have long.", "It was almost over.", "~", "Adrianna set the report down on her desk. She leaned back and ran her fingers through her hair. She was wearing it loose today and the bright blue strands billowed around her hands. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d", "Ezemm Et Ezell dipped his head in a humanlike nod. Under the office lights, the sebaceous oils coating his skin gave him a slight gleam. \u201cI thought you would agree,\u201d he noted. \u201cWandering Sprite broke stealth to get this information to us as quickly as possible.\u201d", "\u201cGood initiative,\u201d Leblanc replied. \u201cPoor judgement.\u201d", "The Penitent blinked. \u201cMy queen?\u201d", "The woman stood, tapping two fingers against the datascroll. \u201cThat fleet isn\u2019t coming here.\u201d", "Ezell took one of his dreadlocks in hand. \u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d he asked. It wasn\u2019t a challenge, but genuine curiousity. \u201cThe execution force has been off our scopes for weeks. They\u2019ve just drawn away a third of the pickets around their forward base. There are only two targets that such a force would be aiming at. Us, or the Principality \u2013 and the Space Force would know that a half-dozen score warships won\u2019t truly dent Kebrak Segment\u2019s defences. It would take hundreds.\u201d", "Adrianna nodded. \u201cYes,\u201d she agreed. \u201cIt would. But that fleet doesn\u2019t have the right disposition to come after us. It\u2019s weighted towards heavy capital hulls.\u201d Thanks to Kemk\u2019s efforts, little information came out of Galhemna, but there were a handful of Red Hand assets active in the system. Not as many or as deeply embedded as she would have liked, and avoiding detection meant their channels to the Red Hand were even more circuitous than normal. One took what one could get, though. In this instance, Adrianna\u2019s operatives been able to forward some details on the execution force that had paid Galhemna a visit, confirming her own suspicions: it was a fleet outfitted for big game. \u201cThey don\u2019t need that for us. We\u2019d be seeing a lot more faster, lighter units if all they were interested in was pirate-smashing.\u201d", "Ezell hemmed for a moment. His job was to oversee all strategic operations in the Veiled Reaches, coordinating the logistics and planning of the various cells, squadrons and warships. It was often like herding mreka, but as he\u2019d once remarked to Jackson, he\u2019d gotten very good at herding mreka. To him, the presence and sudden disappearance of a Compact battle fleet meant they should be evacuating Onza Cr\u00e8che. Leblanc\u2019s confidence was at odds with his own read of the situation, but his queen had not built one of the fastest-growing and capable paramilitary forces in the galaxy without skills of her own. Still, some of his concern must have shown on his face.", "She smiled in that strange human way, showing off small white teeth. Considering all that she had survived, the Penitent wondered how many were original. \u201cWhat is a Chariot, Ezell? Not what it physically is, but what is it seen as?\u201d", "\u201cPower,\u201d the Penitent answered after a brief moment\u2019s thought. \u201cStrength. The will of the Triarchs and the might of the Compact itself.\u201d", "Adrianna nodded. \u201cExactly. Do you think the Compact would send of one their god-ships after us? Its presence alone would legitimize the Red Hand as a threat, one so terrible that a Chariot was needed to deal with us. And not even the bulk of our fleet \u2013 just one swamp nest. We cause them a lot of problems, but not enough that they\u2019re willing to concede us as military equals.\u201d She blew an aggrieved sigh out through her nose. \u201cMuch as it might give my ego a boost to be held in that kind of esteem, we\u2019re not anywhere close to that point.\u201d The loss in 1887-Yiren was a potent reminder of that. More than a dozen of her ships destroyed by a third of their number. Andrew. If it weren\u2019t for the \u2018unknown\u2019 vessel\u2019s arrival, no one at all would have gotten out.", "Ezell thought for a second. He hadn\u2019t considered that aspect. A dreadnought outgunned a goodly portion of the Red Hand fleet all on its own. Sending one, let alone multiple battleship squadrons, against Onza Cr\u00e8che was massive overkill. Some might see it as sending a message for how ruthlessly the Compact was prepared to crush terrorists and insurgents, but he was starting to see it another way.  The queen\u2019s analysis was correct: the message such a deployment also sent was that the Red Hand was powerful enough to require those kinds of forces. They were powerful, a peer to face with overwhelming force and a threat that even the Space Force might fear. Why else would a Chariot be sent to hunt pirates?  \u201cThen where are they going?\u201d he wondered aloud. \u201cIf not us and not the Principality, what other targets are there?\u201d", "The Red Queen shrugged. \u201cThe Compact may be borrowing from the Argosy\u2019s playbook and sending this armada into Kebrak Segment as a flying column. Maybe they\u2019re overconfident and believe that it\u2019s enough to damage the Principality\u2019s holdings. Maybe it\u2019s a raid on Kebrak Daun.\u201d She was quiet a moment. \u201cI want that fleet found, Overseer. Get an observer back to 1893-Yiren. Push our scouts further into the nebula until they locate that fleet. But all reports \u2013 all reports \u2013 come to me directly, understood?\u201d", "Ezemm nodded, making a quick note on his personal datapad. \u201cOf course.\u201d", "\u201cGood. As far as our own operations go, I think we can begin to draw down Operation Pendulum,\u201d Adrianna continued. \u201cIt\u2019s had the desired effect and I don\u2019t want to lose more than we have to.\u201d", "The overseer tipped his head in acknowledgement. The consensus from the Red Hand\u2019s agents in the field was that the Compact believed the insurgency within the Veiled Reaches had been crippled, or at least badly shaken by the loss of the Crusade Commander. That might have been true, but although the Red Hand\u2019s discipline was far from that of a true military hierarchy, it was still firmer than that of any other Unbound force. Without the queen\u2019s return, a collapse of morale was possible. Unlikely, but possible.", "They had sold the Compact on that possibility through Operation Pendulum, a campaign of sporadic, haphazard raids backed up by leaks that suggested dissent and division amongst the Red Hand\u2019s remaining sigil officers. Ezell and his staff had helped coordinate the operation. He\u2019d known the odds against the soldiers they\u2019d sent. Many of the failed assaults had taken heavy or total casualties, but those sacrifices weren\u2019t in vain. Their lives hadn\u2019t been spent for nothing.", "The Compact believed they\u2019d dealt a body blow to the Red Hand in the sector. They weren\u2019t wrong, but the damage wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as they believed. The Red Queen was here and she had been spending days in briefings and meetings, listening to reports, going over strategic and intelligence analyses and working to develop contingencies, false leads, strategic misdirection and potential avenues for counter-offensives. No one could have truly said what was running through her mind, but she had a goal in mind, the same one she\u2019d mentioned when she had first arrived in-system: retribution, but the right way.", "Planned with care, and applied with precision. Coordinated brutality, not the spastic thrashing of a wounded beast, but the considered revenge of a cunning predator. The Queen kept her own counsel, but Ezell was experienced enough to sense that whatever Leblanc was thinking was only the beginning. \u201cUnderstood,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure those orders are dispatched on the next courier run.\u201d", "\u201cThank you, Overseer.\u201d", "Ezell dipped his head. \u201cOf course, Majesty.\u201d", "\u201cYou got the notice for the meeting?\u201d", "\u201cYes, Majesty.\u201d The queen had called for an assembly of all senior staff in the system. Though nothing specific had been announced, Ezell knew what its purpose was. In the last few days, Leblanc had been working even more closely with himself and a few other trusted strategists. Narrowing lists of targets, evaluating enemy force compositions, looking at profiles of enemy commanders and civilian leadership, poring over intelligence files and working up potential mission plans. He and his personnel had been working long and hard to keep up with their monarch, providing her with the information and options she\u2019d requested of them. It had been draining, but Ezemm had found a certain invigouration in it \u2013 a renewed sense of purpose. Most of his staff had never worked directly with the queen before. She had a drive that was infectious, revitalizing personnel that had been demoralized by the loss at Dustball with an intensity and surety in her actions that made you believe, too. Just like Ezell had on that day she\u2019d handed him back his gun and given him a choice.", "At one point, he could scarcely ever believe that he would heed the words of a Broken but now, of all the leaders, commanders and superiors he had had in his life, there was only soul that he could imagine following and only one who he would die for.", "\u201cYou\u2019ve probably already guessed,\u201d the Red Queen said, \u201cbut I will be announcing a shift in our operations within the Veiled Reaches.\u201d", "\u201cThen you\u2019ve made your decision,\u201d Ezell said thoughtfully.", "\u201cI have,\u201d she confirmed. Her blue eyes glinted. \u201cThe Compact is distracted. The execution force is chasing varak, and Kemk\u2019s hounds are just about to breathe a sigh of relief. We\u2019ll let them have that respite for now. They\u2019ll relax, lower their guard\u2026 and then we\u2019ll going to remind them that they will never rest easy. We\u2019ll make them remember Dustball and everyone they\u2019ve murdered. Thanks to your division, I\u2019ve found the best way to do that.\u201d Leblanc\u2019s smile widened, showing off more small white teeth, \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to formally announcing my presence here.\u201d", "~", "Light of Judgement sat at the heart of an armada. More than a hundred and thirty starships surrounded it, from light escorts and scouts, to supply colliers and tenders. The fleet\u2019s main van was four battleship and five battlecruiser squadrons, the heavy capitals forming a full quarter of the fleet\u2019s total numerical strength and a third of the present forces. In firepower alone, the vanguard force was more than double that of the rest of the fleet, with Light of Judgement itself the equivalent of several battleship squadrons. There was enough firepower here to reduce a planet to a glowing, molten ruin several times over. More power than many smaller nations or civilizations would ever have, or could even dream of possessing was assembled in this nameless system. And this was but a fraction\u2019s fraction of the power of the Compact. It was a humbling, awe-inspiring moment for many as for the first time, this armada moved with true purpose.", "The only vessels that weren\u2019t present were the rearguard securing 1893-Yiren, and a handful of scouts still pushing deeper into the Black Veil, deployed to protect the armada from flanking attacks.", "Yunl\u2019ro moved around the Chariot\u2019s command deck, checking in personally with each department and observing their final reports and diagnostics herself. The rest of the fleet was reporting condition blue. It had taken several days to assemble the entire execution force and several more to develop a plan of attack. That was time the enemy had had to prepare, but nothing would be helped by rash action. If the Wound and the traitorous Echo were in this system, then any small scout force would be destroyed easily. Indeed, responding with only a handful of ships could be just what their foe was hoping for. Even a Scar could inflict heavy damage on a raiding party, and sending in Light of Judgement without a full escort was a substantial risk. The Wound was, as Group Leader, Submissive Nasham described, treacherous. Yes, they may have been fortunate. The evidence pointed in that direction\u2026 but others had believed the same in the past. If this was a trap, it would be sprung with the full strength of Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro.", "Assembling the fleet for this operation had cost them, though. The timetable to sweep the nearest systems would have to be completely re-done and with so many ships pulled from their patrol and reconnaissance duties, large gaps had opened in their lines of communication and security sweeps. It was possible this system was being offered to them a distraction, to allow their quarries to escape their grasp\u2026 but the Bastion Leader agreed with Nasham\u2019s assessment. Whether or not Husk was a trap was irrelevant. It was the only lead they had, the first confirmed contact with their prey\u2019s demesne.

There is a threat to our nation and the trillions of souls within it, the enemy you know as Gravestone. We have located the first territory known to be under its control.

The throne had been replaced with something a little easier for the five-foot-eight human to fit into, but it lacked some of the features that many other fixtures had. There were worse things in the universe than a chair that didn\u2019t auto-adjust to your position and body shape, but she needed to play with the lumbar support settings some more.", "The blonde woman was soaked with sweat. Halfway through the simulation, environmental controls had been knocked offline due to \u2018battle damage\u2019 and she\u2019d spent the last three hours in an increasingly sweltering and pungent bridge. She\u2019d completed the mission, though. A lightning raid on a convoy with a heavier-than-expected escort. There had been a few additional wrinkles, but she\u2019d managed to work around them. At least, she hoped she did. The Red Hand didn\u2019t just give its leaders a pat on the head and a starship to play with. Kelkon had bought her credit with Brightest Night\u2019s crew, but she needed more than that. Fresh personnel had been transferred to the ship, and the original crew had had their own ways of doing things. She was still an outsider and she was trying to get herself, the new and old crew working together. It seemed to be going well, but she knew she could be doing better. She wanted to, but some days she still felt overwhelmed.", "Every time she looked at Tactical and didn\u2019t see Allyria, she felt guilty. The other woman was back in their quarters. She didn\u2019t go out much anymore.", "Interrupting her thoughts, the doors to the command deck opened and Strategist Henatil Jendakson stepped inside. The Shimmer\u2019s nostrils closed after one breath of the bridge\u2019s atmosphere, the senior officer\u2019s skin taking on a yellowish hue. Air recirculation only went so far and Jendakson didn\u2019t care for the odours of other species \u2013 particularly humans, as he had informed Grace. He was often arrogant and condescending, and seemed to believe that certain species were indeed lesser than others. The Geontal were of course among those wrongly maligned and though he had never said it, Grace had the impression that he didn\u2019t believe humans were in that category.", "He was good at his job, assisting in the coordination of Red Hand military movements out of the Grasp and within the Idle Depths. He also oversaw the strategic assimilation and instruction of new recruits. Many of the Red Hand\u2019s personnel were either long on ideals and short on experience, or what they did have was drawn from other Unbound factions. The Red Hand was a paramilitary organization and it expected the members of its military wing to have something of a grasp of tactics, more than a war-virgin\u2019s idea of \u2018shoot and keep shooting\u2019 or a pirate\u2019s \u2018run the instant the situation turns against you\u2019. Getting them there was Jendakson\u2019s duty and if a prospective leader or recruit failed to measure up, it was his duty to report that.", "\u201cA fair performance, all of you,\u201d the strategist announced. \u201cLeader Proctor, a moment?\u201d", "Grace nodded, and led the strategist into her office. Like the rest of the corvette\u2019s original command deck, it had been utterly destroyed and had to be completely rebuilt. It was a spartan room, with nothing but a desk, several shelves, some chairs and a couch and a viewscreen that showed the starfield outside. The walls were an unpainted metal hue and there was no carpet. Grace hadn\u2019t had the time to decorate it, though Colony Zanim had suggested she make the time. Even if her appointment to Brightest Night was only temporary, it suggested an investment in the ship and its personnel. She was planning on following through on that suggestion after this series of wargames.", "\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d she asked, sitting on the edge of her desk. The chair here was more comfortable than the command throne, but it was scaled to officers with much larger physiques. She didn\u2019t like how sitting in it made her look.", "The Geontal took one of the guest chairs, sliding a \u2018scroll across the desk to Grace. His skin took on a more neutral light brown hue, but she noticed he was still breathing through his mouth. \u201cMy preliminary evaluation of this exercise. I will be submitting a more complete analysis shortly.\u201d", "Grace picked it up, reading through the strategist\u2019s notes. He made comment of her unconventional tactics. By unconventional, he meant Confederate, even if he didn\u2019t know it. Under Red\u2019s tutelage, she\u2019d studied various schools of strategy, trying to blend those lessons with what she\u2019d already learned as a provisional officer in the Space Force. The Confederacy\u2019s tactics were a close parallel to the how the Red Hand operated. There were two reasons for that. Firstly, the circumstances both navies found themselves in were similar. Compact warships were larger, faster, more heavily armed and armoured than modern day pirate raiders, or the human naval vessels they\u2019d faced two millennia ago. By necessity the tactics the Red Hand developed shared traits with those of the Confederacy \u2013 convergent evolution as applied to military theory.", "Second was the Red Queen\u2019s own influence. Leblanc had studied human military operations herself and over the six decades she\u2019d led the Red Hand, her strategies and doctrines had been taken up by her subordinates.", "Still, a lot of times, sheer firepower and a substantial technological edge more than countered any cleverness. Or your opponents could have those advantages and be just as clever as you. \u201cYour overall assessment?\u201d Grace asked.", "\u201cInexperienced,\u201d the strategist replied. \u201cYou\u2019ve demonstrated leadership qualities and tactical acumen in open space, but in simulations\u2026\u201d Jendakson gestured to the \u2018scroll. \u201cYou are more indecisive and display a tendency to overcompensate as a result of previous mistakes.\u201d", "The young woman nodded to herself. She was very aware of her lack of experience and she knew she\u2019d been struggling. She\u2019d gone from the most junior of officers \u2013 not even a full academy graduate \u2013 to the de facto leader of a handful of defectors, to a member of the most notorious terrorist organization in known space and to a brevet leader of a warship in a matter of months. It was a lot to adjust to and she was trying. Some days it felt like the battle in Kelkon had been easier to deal with. There, she\u2019d known what she had to do. It had been clear, like the moment she\u2019d kept an enraged Janissary from firing into Red\u2019s scarabs. She was doing her best, but she still had a long way to go.", "\u201cBluntly, you are trying too hard,\u201d Jendakson continued, \u201cand it is causing you to make errors that I would not expect from someone who did what you did in Kelkon.\u201d", "Grace closed her eyes. He was right. \u201cI\u2019ll do better.\u201d", "\u201cYou have been,\u201d the older man noted. He may not have cared for humans, but he was professional. \u201cYou have shown noticeable \u2013 often minor and situational but noticeable nonetheless \u2013 improvement in these simulations. I expect this trend to continue.\u201d", "\u201cAnd your recommendation to the Overseer?\u201d", "\u201cIs still pending. You have shown an aptitude for command and strategy. The Red Hand looks for these traits. Shadows know we have elevated leaders based on less, but the situation here in the Idle Depth and Veiled Reaches is more precarious.\u201d", "You have no idea, Grace thought. The refrain ran through her head again. Habreedt. Anvil 731. Aolgh. Z\u2019tarios\u2026 Galhemna. Sundial. Kursk.", "\u201cIt requires a\u2026 skillful touch to manage,\u201d the strategist was continuing. \u201cI see the potential for that in you, but not the fulfillment of it. Yet, at least.\u201d", "Grace nodded. That was what she\u2019d expected. She wanted to do better. She needed to. \u201cThank you for your candor,\u201d she told him and she meant it.", "Jendakson stood to go. \u201cYou and your crew will have my formal evaluation of this simulation by the end of the day, matron. I look forward to seeing Brightest Night leaving the womb and to you fulfilling the potential that our queen has apparently seen.\u201d", "Grace watched him go, letting out a breath as she lay back on her desk and stared up at the gunmetal ceiling. \u201cSo do I,\u201d she said to the empty room. I hope.", "~", "They are here.", "If the totality of the information accumulated by the outer-system listening posts and sensor drones and sent travelling along laser links, comm pulses and radio waves throughout Node 05 could be distilled to a single, simple concept, that was it.", "More than a hundred warp points had been detected. The Confederate Fleet had never numbered so many, so it could only be the Enemy.", "Defences in the outer system were paltry. Node 05\u2019s industrial power was still minimal, and as the newest of the Confederacy\u2019s forward positions, it had had little time to build its defences up. Despite that, in the weeks since Wake of Futures\u2019s sacrifice, the Fleet assets here had done what they could. The minefields in the outer system had been bolstered to some degree, additional hunter-killer drones had been deployed through the Graveyard and a few other surprises had been put into place. Given the volume of space that they had to work with, the odds of inflicting any appreciable damage on even a large fleet were not good. Node 05, and the Confederate Assets overall, simply didn\u2019t have enough resources to properly secure their systems. This point had been raised with Command several times, but resources couldn\u2019t be made to appear with the wave of a wand.", "Luck favoured the Fleet, however. The Enemy had brought their forces into one Node 05\u2019s \u2018shallows\u2019, the areas of a star system where incoming warp points naturally gravitated, and outgoing warp points formed easier. Avoiding an emergence in these areas was difficult, and made a warp jump slightly more risky. For single ships, it was of little consequence, but in mass transitions, that small increase in probability could mean several vessels damaged or even destroyed by an incautious, overly-optimistic or too-cunning maneuver. It was one of the equations that had to be balanced. Risk your ships to an enemy\u2019s defences or to the vagaries of fate.", "The Enemy command had chosen the former. Unsurprising; their scouts had infiltrated Node 05. They had enough of an understanding of the Fleet\u2019s positions and defences to know that they could make this jump without risk of entering a fortified position.", "The Fleet was counting on that and their first gambit paid off.", "~", "One hundred and forty-three seconds. That was how long the heavy cruiser Prominent Bastion would take before its systems stabilized after a shockspace reversion. It would have been less, but the execution force had made a synchronized transition back to realspace. The arguments for and against such things had begun the instant fleets were capable of travelling faster than light and had continued through the millennia with no end in sight. A synchronized shock was carried out when a squadron or fleet utilized the same set of navigational coordinates, calculated and distributed by a single vessel, modified only slightly for each individual ship in the fleet, allowing the armada to emerge in something approximating a battle-ready formation. In an unsynchronized shock, every vessel calculated its own navigational information independently.", "In theory, there should be little to no difference between synchronized and unsynchronized data, but in practice even the smallest variations in computational capability, power and accuracy could lead to extreme variations in a vessel\u2019s emergent shockpoint. An unsynchronized mass transition could end up with vessels scattered wildly out of formation, with their shockpoints lethally close to one another, outside the projected arrival zones or even resulting in collisions.", "A synchronized transition avoided much of that; using a single set of navigational data made such \u2018minor\u2019 accidents much less likely. The other side of that was that possibility of a single catastrophe wiping out the entire fleet, while virtually negligible, was not nil. Regardless, it was deemed a statistically acceptable risk. Other than that, the main issue with synchronized transitions was that they required the ships involved to emerge in relative proximity to one another. The release of so much energy in such a concentrated area had a deleterious effect on the vessels\u2019 system recovery and stabilization times. Modern strategic thinking was that with recovery times as low as they were, there was less and less rationale not to use synchronized shocks.", "The opening moments of the battle of Husk would provide an eloquent counter-argument.", "Prominent Bastion was originally deployed on the lower port flank of the fleet, there to coordinate the movement of nearby scouts and picket forces. Ordinarily protected by a screen of its own, the heavy cruiser\u2019s position noticeably drifted after its arrival, and the vessel emerged well outside its intended arrival zone, on the outside of the Execution Force\u2019s perimeter.", "The scout sweeps had been thorough. There was no minefield. No defence installations, no asteroid bases or any substantial network of pickets. The area was almost as clear as any part of intrastellar space could be.", "Almost.", "Leyak Three drifted silently, powered down and inert. One of a handful of vessels left in Node 05\u2019s outer system specifically for this contingency, it had and its kin had watched over this patch of the void for weeks. It was simply happenstance that Three happened to be the closet.", "One hundred and forty-three seconds.", "Three was just over a light-minute from Prominent Bastion\u2019s position. It took several seconds for the destroyer\u2019s crude mind to sort substance from the massive flare of electromagnetic and gravitic energy of the Enemy fleet\u2019s warp jump and a moment more for it to decide that this opportunity overrode all other contingencies it had been given. Four missiles more suited to the arsenal of fortresses or dreadnoughts pulsed from Three\u2019s prow tubes, their launch and subsequent drive ignition temporarily overwhelming the destroyer\u2019s stealth systems. The vessel quickly faded back into cloak, its massive warheads hurling themselves at the ill-fated Prominent Bastion.", "The heavy cruiser\u2019s scopes returned seven seconds before impact. Point defence fire was ineffective and the screens were still coming to full power when the missiles entered attack range. Their warheads activated, and spewed cones of fire more terrible than any of the nuclear weapon of ages past. All four struck Prominent Bastion. Composite armour boiled into vapour, as hull plating further from the sites of impact turned into molten liquid, streaming from the wounded vessel like tears. Atmosphere within Prominent Bastion flash-ignited, boiling crew in their suits where they weren\u2019t instantly incinerated. Internal bulkheads crumpled and collapsed as the seething plasma cored through deck after deck, eventually breaching the vessel\u2019s armoured core.", "On Light of Judgement\u2019s command bridge, Yunl\u2019ro watched Prominent Bastion\u2019s final throes. The heavy cruiser was coming apart. Its superstructure was compromised; secondary explosions, hull breaches and bulkhead collapses were tearing a kilometer-long starship apart. Saviour pods and evacuation craft were blossoming away from the dying vessel as its crew raced to abandon ship. Other vessels, including Prominent Bastion\u2019s own squadron, were moving to assist with rescue operations.", "Yunl\u2019ro did not believe in an afterlife, but she knew that conditions aboard that vessel would be very close to certain depictions of hell. Uncontrolled fires and decompressions would be tearing through the vessel, blast doors sealing men and women away from safety in order to protect the rest of the ship as power overloads and blackouts trapped fleeing, panicked crew in the dark. Burning alive or freezing to death, the air stolen from bursting lungs, skin blistering and bleeding from overdoses of radiation; those were the fates that everyone aboard Prominent Bastion faced. They would be lucky if even half the crew survived.", "\u201cAdjust fleet ranks to compensate for Prominent Bastion\u2019s loss,\u201d the Thoughtful ordered. \u201cMessage to Prime Vellasos. Yensengit\u2019s Pendant will assume Prominent Bastion\u2019s coordination and control duties. Increase our drone augur shell by another sixty units and push the outer tier of fleet defence platforms out an additional million kilometers.\u201d She doubted that this assassin was alone and she intended to force it and its kin as far back from her fleet as possible. As her orders were issued, Yunl\u2019ro turned to her Scopes officer. \u201cShow me the attacker.\u201d", "The main viewscreen shifted to a sensor plot. The Bastion Leader had infiltrated several scouts ahead of the fleet. One of them had been fortunate enough to get a glimpse of the vessel as it had launched. No images, but some scope telemetry. It was small, barely four hundred meters long. The activation of its launch tubes and the flare of the missile drives disrupted its stealth for seventeen seconds. Then, it faded back to nothing. The ship itself was not what the Thoughtful was most interested in. \u201cThose are titan-rated weapons,\u201d she observed. The damage to Prominent Bastion made their destructive capability blindingly obvious, but the drive systems were far too powerful. Those weren\u2019t merely short-burn weapons.", "When the Space Force put heavy capital missiles on lighter hulls, they usually stripped the payload out of the original weapon and installed it into a standard chassis. The additional mass decreased the missile\u2019s acceleration and maneuvering capability substantially, but it gave them an unexpected punch at close range. Escort hulls were simply too small to carry titan-rated missiles in any number.", "Of course, if you didn\u2019t need personnel quarters, food stores, medical decks, life support, artificial gravity or any creature comforts for a crew with their frail organic bodies and biological needs, you could free up a lot more space to fit in heavy weaponry. The ship that had just killed one of hers was a drone.", "Her staff were reviewing the data, but Yunl\u2019ro didn\u2019t needed their analysis. She had studied enough of previous missions\u2019 reports. The types of missiles, their yield and the energy signature correlated stronger with those deployed by the Wound. It had infested this system, spreading its soulless, mindless creations across the orbital tracks\u2026 and it had used them to kill more of her people.", "The Thoughtful tilted her head as Ukask approached, her sigil leader stepping up on the dais to approach her. \u201cWhy not use shorter-ranged weapons?\u201d he wondered aloud, though soft enough that only she and her senior officers could hear him. \u201cThey could fit more of them in\u2026\u201d", "\u201cLonger range, better tracking systems, more maneuvering capacity.\u201d Yunl\u2019ro surmised. \u201cThe missile strikes were precision hits.\u201d She tapped several controls on her throne, replaying Prominent Bastion\u2019s death. One pair of the missiles had targeted its port flank, the other had overshot the heavy cruiser to target its starboard side. Each port and starboard impact was one half of an attempt to bisect the warship. Missiles were not terribly accurate, but the plumes from this were tighter than most others Yunl\u2019ro had seen.", "Ukask saw it now, too. His teeth bared slightly. \u201cThey intended to cause massive structural damage.\u201d", "\u201cAnd succeeded,\u201d the Bastion Leader noted. Her nostrils slits opened slightly. \u201cThis is unfortunate, but it supports our intelligence that this system\u2019s defences are minimal. Once the fleet has returned to formation, we will advance. The rearguard will take up their positions as planned.\u201d She felt the eyes of her crew on her. Her people had a reputation for bloodlessness and in her career, she\u2019d done little to cut against that. Now was no time to do so. Tens of thousands of souls had just perished, but there would be more than enough time to mourn them, and there would be doubtlessly more casualties before this campaign concluded. \u201cPush our drone shell out. Find whatever killed our comrades and give our gunners a target.\u201d", "The mission came first. Then the dead.", "As the fleet moved back into position, creating a formation millions of kilometers across, Yunl\u2019ro stood upon her dais and looked out at the system her people now called Husk, wondering just else they would find within it.", "~", "Nenkot arrived at his destination, moving with greater purpose, trying to match the never-ending hustle of the people here without being too obvious. He was in one of the work hangars, filled with small shuttles for personnel and cargo transfers to and from the station and the Chariots within it, as well as large EVA suits and construction pods used by the extra-vehicular construction teams. They were almost one-soul ambulatory shuttles, outfitted with multiple systems from plasma cutters to nanowelders. Nenkot had used them often. He\u2019d enjoyed his work. The solitude, the idle chatter of his comrades over the comm and good music playing on the radio, the skill he\u2019d put into his work and the pride he\u2019d taken in it. That was all over, but he still had a final task to perform.", "He headed towards the nearest shuttle. It left every day at this time, stocked with replacement parts for the EVA teams at work on the station itself. Behind him, one of the security teams was listening intently to their comm. Something had their attention. Nenkot tried not to run. The agent must have been missed by now. They were probably hoping to keep things quiet. He hoped the proctors didn\u2019t notice him, considering just another Worker in the crowd.", "Nenkot climbed into the shuttle. \u201cHey there,\u201d he called to the pilot and co-pilot. The former was a Steersman, the other was a female Penitent. \u201cI missed my tram. Any chance of getting a drop-off in Blue Five?\u201d That was strictly against regulations, but small favours like those were common amongst the rank-and-file of the work teams.", "\u201cSure thing,\u201d the pilot answered. \u201cYou made it just in time. We\u2019re about to take off.\u201d", "Nenkot looked out the bulbous cockpit window. The proctors he\u2019d seen were now looking around the hangar. One was talking to some techs and the other was speaking into his comm. He had been noticed. The Worker\u2019s left hand tightened on the backs of the pilot\u2019s chairs as his other reached into his tunic for the metal weight pressing against his skin.", "\u201cShuttle Seven-One-Oh-Seven requesting authorization to leave,\u201d the pilot said as he retracted the stairs and sealed the hatch. There was a buzzing response through his headset. \u201cCopy that.\u201d The shuttle lifted off the deck. Nenkot\u2019s stomach tied into knots as the small ship passed through the inner airlock doors.

The response was longer this time. Neither pilot nor co-pilot answered right away. Nenkot knew what they were being told. As the co-pilot turned towards him, the Worker drew his stolen pistol and shot her in the face, following up by shooting the pilot in the back of the head. He leaned over the controls and pushed on the throttle, the vessel shooting out through the doors and into open space.", "The comm blared, ordering the shuttle to heave to, but Nenkot wasn\u2019t listening. He pulled the pilot\u2019s body out of the chair and sat down, ignoring the wetness in the chair. He activated the comm system and started typing in directional coordinates, a sequence of numbers the woman with clever eyes had given him and told him never to write down. Once that was done, he inserted the datachip, using the encryption he\u2019d been taught and adding a message of his own to the notes and pictures he\u2019d taken and the work logs he\u2019d acquired. That would have to be enough. The shuttle was coming about. They\u2019d had overridden its controls and were bringing it back to the hangar. The outer airlock opened again.", "Nenkot hurriedly finished his message and pressed his thumb down on the controls, transmitting it out into the system, intended for one point and one recipient in particular. He leaned back in the chair as the external doors closed behind him and the inner doors opened. There was a swarm of proctors and more than a few military security teams waiting for him.", "It was over. He\u2019d won, though. He\u2019d done the one thing he\u2019d never had the courage to do before now. He\u2019d made a stand. He\u2019d stood up against the Compact. He finally knew who he was. Nenkot looked at the pistol on the shuttle\u2019s dashboard. He picked it up and put the barrel against his own head.", "~", "Almost every piece of celestial flotsam and jetsam in Galhemna was known, its presence catalogued and its course through the system logged. Included among the thousands of asteroids, moonlets, dwarf planets, comets and planetary fragments was the unassuming piece of rock known as Galhem-26813. It was a carbonaceous asteroid of no appreciable value. Its surface was so dark that it was almost invisible to the naked eye and it drifted well outside the boundaries of the outer-system asteroid belt, long ago jostled from its original orbit somewhere in the system\u2019s Kupier belt. In local star charts, Galhem-26813 was listed simply as a navigation hazard. It had no other characteristics that made it noteworthy and no one had bothered to turn so much as a telescope in its direction for a very long time.", "Even if they had, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered.", "Hidden within a large fissure in the asteroid was a small, needle-shaped vessel, nearly all engine. Its hull was covered in adaptive smart paint that imitated the asteroid\u2019s surface nearly perfectly, so any optical scans of Galhem-26813 would show nothing out of the ordinary. The ship had arrived in-system months ago, just before Nenkot had begun work, carried aboard a friendly freighter and released just as the larger ship had transitioned into Galhemna, taking weeks to crawl its way towards Galhem-26813 and burrow inside the vast canyon.", "The ship itself was dark and cold, with only the tiniest trickle of power still running through its systems. Its crew was limited to a single pilot, asleep and curled within the cocoon she\u2019d spun as her ship had nestled itself inside the asteroid and powered itself down. She could survive like this for years without needing a cryosleep pod or even life support. Indeed, her people were perfect for these types of operations.", "The vessel\u2019s one concession to its mission was the comm probe it extended out of the fissure, listening to communications traffic throughout Galhemna, cataloguing and recording what it could, the ship\u2019s mind dutifully sorting and analyzing each intercepted message for anything that would necessitate waking its pilot. In all the months it had lain here, nothing had been that important.", "Finally, it received a transmission that was. It was a tightbeam message to these coordinates, broadcast on a civilian frequency, but it carried the correct authorization codes. The content of the message was, if the mind could have understood the concept, highly disturbing. For two point seven seconds, the mind weighed its options before deciding that this was something worth waking its pilot for.", "The mind began to pressurize the vessel again, bringing the temperature from up deathly cold to something more palatable for its sole crew member. While it did this, the mind also ran through vessel\u2019s power-up checklist and initiated a fresh set of diagnostics. Probability suggested that more serious action would be necessary. It reached out to the cybernetic implants within its pilot and triggered them, stimulants bringing her out of her torpor. A spindly shape within the cocoon spasmed and thrashed as the drugs took effect. Sharp chitinous edges along forearms, shins, fingers and toes dug into the silken material, cutting and ripping through it.", "The pilot pulled herself from her cocoon. She vomited on the floor, shaking and trembling from the after-effects of the hibernation and the drugs that had roused her. The organic parts of her brain came to full wakefulness, the cybernetic implants and upgrades in her skull re-integrating her thoughts. She had been the ship. She had slept. Now, she was awake and both parts of her worked together again, machine and organic paired again.", "Information trickled into her thoughts from logs and data records, the recent transmission first and foremost. It was brief, little more than an authentication code and a terse pulse of information, but it was more than enough. Images of ships under construction, classified work logs and maintenance reports confirming the identity of those vessels and their state of construction. Yes, more than enough to wake her and make her break her ship\u2019s somnolence\u2026", "\u2026and enough for the hounds to catch her scent. A destroyer had already turned towards Galhem-26813 and another pair of ships further in-system were accelerating towards the asteroid. They\u2019re responded quickly; they\u2019d known where the message was being sent within minutes of its transmission. The agent had been careless. No thought of rescue or extraction crossed the pilot\u2019s mind as her long limbs danced over the controls. If the agent had been careless, then they were dead or in enemy hands. She didn\u2019t care which. Her mission was to wait for the data and to escape before she was killed, nothing else. She had the data. Now, there was only survival.", "The reactor stuttered to full power as the ship came alive, the heat and surge of energy marking the asteroid to every peering scope and sensor in the system. Within seconds of that registering on the destroyer\u2019s scopes, an order to her to stand down was sent, which she ignored. Sensors then registered incoming missile tracks.", "The pilot braced herself into an acceleration couch. Inertial dampeners were not fully on-line, but there was no time to get them there. With a flicker of thought, she overrode the safeties and her ship blasted out of concealment, its drive wake ripping Galhem-26813 in half. The lumps of bisected rock turned to dispersing gas moments later as the destroyer\u2019s missiles converged on the asteroid.", "Communications were received again and ignored again, more orders and threats to cut her thrust. The destroyer was still behind her, but she was accelerating faster than it was and the gap between them was opening. The pilot felt her chest and abdomen compress from the pressure, minor blood vessels popping from the strain. Her crash couch compensated, injecting a cocktail to keep her awake as her ship flung itself towards the outer system. The destroyer was falling behind, unable to match her ship\u2019s dangerously high acceleration.", "The missiles would still overtake her, though. She released one of her two defence platforms. The drone swung away from her craft, almost perfectly emulating her ship\u2019s energy signature as it veered onto a new course and giving the missiles chasing her two identical target profiles. Half of the missiles switched to pursue the decoy. The remainder wouldn\u2019t be enough to kill her.", "The needle vessel ran. It never slowed, running at a harmful level of thrust, its pilot only kept awake and alive through her own physiology and from the drugs pumping into her body. Three more times it came under attack and three more times it escaped. It almost died twice, but it survived.", "It crossed the transition boundary and with a final salvo of missiles moments from destroying it, the stealth courier flashed out of reality, racing to Kebrak Daun. The enemy would know where she was going, but that didn\u2019t matter. They couldn\u2019t catch her now.", "As the vessel raced to safety, the pilot slumped in her chair, rasping for breath from bruised organs, biomonitors flashing with multiple medical alerts. With a mental command, she ordered the vessel\u2019s auto-medic to begin treatment. As the sedatives took effect and she was cut out of her flight suit, the pilot confirmed that the ship was on course. Galhemna was building more than a patrol fleet. It was building a war fleet. It was building Chariots.", "Sundial was coming."]}

This interlaced network of augur drones and shipboard scopes repeatedly picked up \u2018possible\u2019 contacts that faded away as soon as any attempt was made to get definitive readings. Yunl\u2019ro knew that the enemy was probing her armada, seeking to determine the limits of the Compact\u2019s scouts and the efficacy of their own stealth systems. She had ordered the screen not to engage several possible contacts that had crept in and withdrawn, letting the enemy build an incorrect profile of her capabilities.", "Despite that, she didn\u2019t like that they were not attacking. This evaluative reconnaissance was too considered a strategy. There was intelligence guiding it, and patience behind it. That was concerning.", "She continued to study the main display screen, her eyes moving from it to smaller secondary plots, showing supplementary or localized information. Their arrival had certainly been noticed by now, but several of the vessels further in-system made no attempt to alter course and their acceleration remained unchanged. Strategic assessment was that those were simple service drones, not valuable enough to be given higher-order decision making capabilities and limited to rote tasks\u2026 or they were bait, mimicking simpleminded machine minds in order to lure intruders closer.", "Whatever their nature, they would still have to be investigated and destroyed, but they were still the better part of a day away from her fleet and thus, a distraction to current events. There was no sign of either the Wound or the Echo platform\u2019s purloined Chariot; a star system was vast, but there were still only a limited number of places that titan-scale warships could hide.", "Gas giants were a favourite of their quarry, and often utilized by the Compact itself and the navies of other nations for the same reasons. Turbulent and energetic atmospheres could overshadow the emissions of the largest vessel and the thick clouds made visual identification nearly impossible, while the plethora of moons and satellites many of those planets possessed obstructed firing lines, limited maneuvers and provided ample cover against long-range bombardment. Clearing a gas giant was always dangerous, as many of the Wound\u2019s pursuers had found out to their cost, most recently the battlecruisers of the Veiled Archers during the seventh battle of Sol.", "Unlike the benighted home system of the Broken, Husk had only a pair of such worlds, the sixth and seventh planets of the system. The former was a sickly yellow planet with a striated atmosphere and wide but faint, thin rings of dust. The latter was a larger, storm-hewn blue and green giant tilted more than a hundred degrees on its axis, its clouds whorled by storms that were \u2018merely\u2019 the size of continents up to those large enough to swallow planets.

There were starships there\u2026 or least, what had once been starships.

The computer was analyzing them now, as was her own staff. She selected one such image, taken from one of the telescopic arrays aboard Light of Judgement itself. The vessel there looked like a helium-3 tanker. Several of its storage capsules had been breached by railfire, which would have spilled its valuable cargo into space. \u201cThe blast patterns on this vessel are too irregular and imprecise to be the victim of our target. I suspect this was a casualty of an Unbound attack. I would even guess that a substantial fraction of these ships have similar provenance.

The Thoughtful woman was certain that such revelations would result in sleepless nights for her peers and superiors, as it had for her own staff. The possibility that the Red Hand were working with the Wound had been examined in the past, but it was not until 1893-Yiren that any links were more than paper carnic and pattern phantoms.

If there\u2019d been any survivors from the Compact\u2019s ambush over Dustball, then they were in a detention center now. The thought made her sick, but there was nothing she could do.

The fleet\u2019s visual sensors, telescopes and recon drones had gotten imagery of Qobieshii. It was a Galann Feron-class passenger liner, little more than eight hundred meters long and shaped like a shallow-sea sunfish, with dorsal and ventral fins holding high-class suites and passenger amenities, large windows along its flanks and coloured in bright, eye-catching hues. A titan-scale warship couldn\u2019t feign to be something that size. Something smaller could, but given what Yunl\u2019ro had just witnessed, she felt more than a sliver of doubt at that.

She knew he was thinking the same thing she was: the way the corpses upon the transport they\u2019d taken had been turned against them. They might have just seen the bloodless murder of hundreds of people. Or they might have seen theater of machine-parasitized corpses. The Thoughtful could not have said, but she could feel a change in atmosphere on her command deck. Her people knew they could not have saved the Qobieshii, and they knew it might have been a trap\u2026 but that did not change the fact that they might have just seen hundreds of civilians die so that their ship could be harvested for parts. With an execution force bearing down on them, \u2018Gravestone\u2019 still went about its business.", "\u201cThis changes nothing,\u201d she declaimed. \u201cThe sweep will continue. Our enemy is here. They will be found and destroyed.\u201d", "\u201cMatron,\u201d Operations said. \u201cWe are detecting additional energy signatures from the debris field. There may be other intact ships.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro replied. \u201cI am aware.\u201d She would not throw away the fleet\u2019s operations on the vagaries of long-range augurs and the possibility that there might be something there. \u201cThe sweep will continue as scheduled.\u201d", "Operations tilted his held in acknowledgement and returned to his station. \u201cIf those are our ships\u2026\u201d Ukask quietly commented. \u201cIf they are still crewed\u2026\u201d", "\u201cThen I have consigned their personnel and passengers to death,\u201d the Thoughtful answered, easing herself back into her command throne. She brought up a display. \u201cTo reach the debris field as quickly as possible, we would have to dispatch screening vessels. To ward against further ambushes by stealth ships or a Scar, that force would have to be substantial, creating exploitable weaknesses in our defence perimeter. If the fleet moves together, a least-time approach vector to the debris field would bring our units within striking distance of Husk Six, which we have not yet secured.\u201d She turned her expression on her sigil leader. \u201cOne ambush is enough for today. I will not rush this fleet into another if I can avoid it. If those calls for aid are genuine, then their fate is the same if we had never come here.\u201d", "Ukask was silent and tipped his head in acknowledgment. The Bastion Leader\u2019s equations were cold, but accurate. Their enemy could be trying to lure them into precipitous action. Divide the fleet to attack its weaker ships, strike at the exposed heavier vessels, or pounce upon them from cover. Still, that would be little comfort to any souls still alive out there, waiting for their ship to be devoured as Qobieshii was now and wondering why the Compact was not coming to their aid.", "The mission had to come first, though. No matter the cost.", "~", "The Enemy\u2019s course remained unchanged, their formation intact: a single large globe moving along the ecliptic, with one recon squadron above and one below the system\u2019s plane. They were sowing dozens of sensor drones as they moved, building a lattice of scanners through which even a Leyak\u2019s cloak would be hard-pressed to slip. It had been the hope that Qobieshii\u2019s death would inspire haste or desperation in the hostile force commander, but their foe did not react to Violet Seven\u2019s latest tableau.", "That was fine. While a welcome possibility, the outcome had been small. Gambling otherwise would have been foolish. The Enemy did not often make those kinds of errors. It had been worth the effort to invite one, even if the alien commander hadn\u2019t accepted. They would simply have to speak louder next time, but for now\u2026 the Enemy were approaching the orbital tracks of Node 05\u2019s seventh planet.", "It was time for the next phase of the operation.", "~", "\u201cRiogant Dendesn to sigil.

So far, Astrographics had counted approximately ninety moons. The inexact nature of that determination rankled the Thoughtful, as most forms of imprecision did, but she didn\u2019t believe in coin-counting in a burning palace. A proper astrographic survey could have sorted errant dwarf planets and captured asteroids from actual moons, but the Bastion Leader had neither the time nor inclination to do so, so \u201capproximately ninety\u201d was good enough. Sixteen of those were large planetoids. Two of which had an atmosphere, and two \u2013 including one of the former \u2013 had a magnetosphere. The planet\u2019s off-axis rings rose over its wandering comrades, like a dame\u2019s balcony above a suitor, casting them in the shadow of a distant sun.", "These particular scope drones were stealth recon variants. Each was an angled obelisk covered in augur-scattering chameleon hull plating, their thermal output and energy signature were minimized, making them as hard to detect as anything without shroud systems. Once launched, they were almost impossible to detect.", "The first of them made it past the first fifty-eight moons before its signal winked out. The last thing it saw was the ignition of an interceptor missile\u2019s drive.", "Within thirty-seven seconds, the other two recon platforms met similar fates. One of the counter-missiles had been launched from a small moonlet, but the other two had come from spaceborne positions. There hadn\u2019t been enough data to tell whether those were pre-positioned warheads, deployed from missile pods, or had been launched from stealthed starships.", "Fortunately, the third drone managed to get slightly closer to the planet. Before it was destroyed, it registered a large power signature, something that could only have come from a heavy capital ship. There was something hidden close to that world, but the drone hadn\u2019t been able to localize or identify the emissions before it was destroyed.", "Fields of static blossomed across the plot as hostile EW platforms suddenly activated, creating a jamming field more than a two hundred thousand kilometers to a side. Visual information was the only thing that could get through that miasma, but nothing was forthcoming. Whatever had activated those platforms clearly did not want the fleet\u2019s sensors prying at the planet and since whatever was in there was also unable to be picked up on visuals, the only way to know was to send ships in to investigate.", "It was a trap, of course.", "\u201cMove the Black Racers out,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro ordered. \u201cThey are to sweep the inner orbitals and seed augur platforms.

Feed all telemetry to the sigil.\u201d She watched the fleet display as a squadron of destroyers detached from the armada and accelerated towards Husk Seven, the unit splitting apart to allow the ships to scour the planet\u2019s innermost moons, rings and cloud tops. Behind them, a squadron of light cruisers followed.", "\u201cWhat do you think, submissive?\u201d Yunl\u2019ro asked of Nasham. \u201cDo you believe we\u2019ve stumbled upon a sleeping god?\u201d The question could have been mocking, but it was earnest, despite the Bastion Leader\u2019s turn of phrase.", "\u201cNo, matron,\u201d the younger man answered. \u201cI think we\u2019ve found pottery warriors.\u201d", "~", "Leyak Four was in the shadow of a nameless moon, hiding in the heavy magnetic fluctuations and radiation storms caused by the interplay of the gas giant\u2019s radiation belts with the moon\u2019s magnetosphere.

It had been what the Enemy had detected, letting them see just enough to tempt them.", "Four listened to the whispers of telemetry being fed to it, and waited.

It was a big vessel, most definitely titan-scale. It was trying to hide in the planet\u2019s rings, but its clumsy passage had disturbed the otherwise orderly lines of dust, rock and ice. The destroyer was pulling in visual imagery now. The hull form and emissions pattern were completely unfamiliar to Yuuunis or anything in his ship\u2019s databanks. The vessel was a hemispheric shape, with multiple nacelles, engineering decks and other structures extruded behind it like tentacles, as if the ship was some kind of sea creature, but there was little trace of the organic to it. It looked more like its hull been carved from textured stone and built upon. There was something oddly familiar about it, but Yuuunis couldn\u2019t place it.", "That wasn\u2019t the only thing that had caught his attention.

The range was short, but they had started from rest and needed time to accelerate. That gave the Black Racers an advantage and the destroyers\u2019 point defences went to rapid fire, turrets sweeping local space clean with pulses of hard light, interceptors racing to meet the awakening shipkillers, bright flashes indicating the counter-missiles\u2019 successes. But there were more.", "A warning throbbed on Riogant Corat\u2019s command deck. Something had a target lock on them. It wasn\u2019t the vessel in the rings. It was closer.

The range was too short for heavy missiles; Leyak Four\u2019s massive particle cannon was the only effective weapon it had at close quarters and the stealth destroyer chased after Riogant Sevkosh, already compensating for the disruption to its targeting. Missiles started to detonate around it as the rest of the squadron rallied to their comrade\u2019s defence, but they were spread and engaged themselves.", "Several million kilometers away from the battle, the seven light cruisers of the Night Children had begun accelerating towards the planet, responding to the destroyers\u2019 sudden distress. Their missiles burned hard through through the orbital pathways of Husk Seven, triggering the activation of more interceptors and anti-ship mines.", "Aboard Riogant Dendesn, the squadron\u2019s prime belted out orders as her beleaguered squadron engaged the missiles, mines and attempted to neutralize the stealth destroyer. The noose around the squadron was tightening and Riogant Sevkosh was running out of time.", "Sevkosh was overrunning its drive, keeping its aft and the cone of spatial distortion pointed directly towards the enemy vessel and calling for the rest of its comrades to assist. The Compact destroyer\u2019s aft turrets fired, but they were dealing with the destroyer\u2019s own backwash as well, and the few shots that could target the enemy clinging resolutely to their stern splashed harmlessly against the stealth warships\u2019s screens. A hideous glow seeped from the unclassified\u2019s prow as its particle cannon charged again. The second blast came within twenty-seven kilometers as Leyak Four\u2019s targeting algorithms narrowed in on the hostile destroyer, seining substance from the distorted signals and local interference its sensors were reporting. Its prow swung towards the fleeing alien ship, lining up a killshot\u2026", "Riogant Dendesn came screaming in above its compatriot, the squadron command ship killing its thrust and rolling hard, its crew crushed into their acceleration chairs and emergency webbing, many of them losing consciousness from the stress of the maneuver. Auto-targeting weapons batteries opened fire, clawing at the black-hulled killer. Alien screen sections flared, attempted to resist the barrage and failed. Dendesn\u2019s weapons ripped holes deep into the stealth destroyer\u2019s hull, breaching vital sections. Power fluctuations crackled through Four\u2019s length, and multiple primary and secondary systems failed. Even as its body died, Leyak Four refused to let go of its prey. Its particle beam was already charged and its failing, blinded sensors had a shooting solution.", "Riogant Sevkosh\u2019s engine section exploded into vapour, the destroyer instantly crippled. Nearly a third of the ship was destroyed outright or lethally contaminated with Bremsstrahlung from the particle beam shearing through screens and hull.

The missiles were set for omnidirectional blasts. Even in that narrow area, they would cause little damage. There were no shockwaves in space to carry a concussive force, only the pulse of radiation from the missiles\u2019 warheads. That was what the Bastion Leader wanted, an electromagnetic storm to irradiate delicate electronics and shred cloaking fields, leaving what was in there bare to her soldiers\u2019 guns.", "The target knew that too.", "A Splinter appeared, dropping its stealth field as its engines spooled up, hurrying to take it out of the blast zone. Its command and control functions wouldn\u2019t fare any better from the missile barrage than its ECM. Without it, the missile swarms and drone platforms it was coordinating would drop in effectiveness. The vessel was ugly; a long cylinder with a lamprey-mouth prow and several rings of spines \u2013 comm towers and transmission nodes \u2013 along its brass-hued hull. Once hidden, now fleeing before it could be destroyed.", "The cruiser realized its command unit was in danger, but it had been protecting its other ally and couldn\u2019t reach the spindly ship in time.

For an instant, the plot was gone as the wash of radiation blinded the ships in the region. When it cleared, the enemy\u2019s ECM network was tattered and shredded. Dozens of hostile warheads and mines had been irradiated to uselessness, their scopes blind and delicate internal circuitry ruined. The Compact squadrons\u2019 own drones and sensors were just as harshly affected as those of their enemies, but that was a small price. The Compact ships would get their augurs back up within moments.", "The enemy would too, but their command vessel\u2019s ability to coordinate this ambush was all but gone. Their protective jamming fields were torn open. The Compact ships could clearly see their enemies now. Datalinked telemetry trickled back to Light of Judgement.

Those missiles swarmed through the fleet, sweeping above and below Husk Seven\u2019s orbital planes. At the apex of their climb and descent, the missiles rolled, their sensor eyes confirming the presence of their targets through the faded remains of the miasma of electromagnetic, gravitic and thermal interference, waiting for the final input from their command ships.", "As soon as the hostile launch had been detected, the Aeshma moved into close-flying pairs, repeating their stratagem from the earlier ambush, only now their deception wasn\u2019t intended to give their opponents faulty information on force composition. They were trying to keep their mothership alive. Counter-missiles arced up and down the orbital plane, the gunships and Shaushka prioritizing any missile that locked onto the escort carrier. Leyak Four was still struggling to become operational again. Yaojing Two barely had any defences, the command vessel built for stealth and fleet control. It relied on its cloak and compatriots to protect it.", "The few functional interceptors left within the planet\u2019s rings and innermost moons came on-line, burning hard towards the larger shipkillers that were arcing in like the teeth of a monster\u2019s closing maw.

In raw numbers, the rate of exchange was not in Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s favour.", "Proportionally, the AIs had lost a sixth of their stealth combatants, a third of their command and control capability, a quarter of their gunship platforms and the damage to Shaushka had noticeably degraded the carrier\u2019s combat capability. The Enemy fleet might have lost more in raw numbers, but they had far more ships than the Fleet did. In point of fact, the alien armada outnumbered the Fleet Assets within Node 05 eight to one, and this single invasion force substantially outnumbered the Confederate Fleet in its entirety. The Enemy had more than enough ships to make this a battle of attrition. The Confederacy\u2019s resources were not infinite. Every casualty hurt them far, far more than it did their opponents and the loss of a Yaojing so early in the conflict was a severe setback.", "But they had been blooded. They had been baited.

The Writ said four missiles shouldn\u2019t be able to make it through a fleet\u2019s defensive perimeter, but these carried impressive ECM systems and were faster and more maneuverable than the weaponry standard engagement doctrines dealt with. After losing one destroyer and suffering a crippled frigate, Yunl\u2019ro had moved her escorts in and pushed her light capital ships out. The enemy\u2019s attacks still occasionally slipped through, but that was rarer and when they did, they no longer cost her a ship with a single hit.", "They enemy had adapted to that tactic. Now, one of them would target one of her screen; if the hit was good, there would be a second launch, either from the original vessel or one of its comrades. To counter that, the Bastion Leader cycled her screen elements: as soon as one was damaged, it withdrew. It made the fleet\u2019s screen more fluid than she was comfortable with, but it was a necessity.", "The enemy were too far away for return fire and they never attacked from the same relative position twice, but her strategists and tacticians were analysing their movements, looking for a pattern, just as her Operations teams were studying their stealth systems and the missiles\u2019 ECM. If the enemy got bold enough and pushed in far enough to try and make a kill instead of sniping, she would make them pay for that arrogance.", "The Compact fleet was learning, even if Yunl\u2019ro chafed at the cost of this education. Their forces had always suffered greatly when engaging the Wound, but the Thoughtful had hoped to at least catch sight of her quarry before taking this level of casualties. Probe and retreat, probe and retreat. They were testing her.", "Ships of that size couldn\u2019t carry much ordnance, especially not heavy capital missiles. They would either run out soon, or they were being resupplied. Yunl\u2019ro suspected the latter. Several of her own ships were running under stealth, looking to ambush the enemy destroyers when they revealed themselves to launch or trying locate either the colliers feeding them or the Splinter coordinating these actions. She believed there was one, and the fleet\u2019s own recon units had picked up indications of another command unit out here.", "\u201cIt\u2019s been busy,\u201d Nasham had observed. Yunl\u2019ro was inclined to agree.", "The fleet had encountered several small minefields as well. They remained dormant until the fleet was within them, but the execution force\u2019s depth of defences prevented any serious damage. The fields were simply too light and spread out to overwhelm the execution force, though the stealth ships took advantage of the distractions. That was how Yunkeng Irida had been crippled.", "Still, for now there was a breather. It would be some time before the enemy attacked again. While she waited for the next sniping assault, Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s sent a message to her steward to have a light meal brought up for the command crew. Combat operations in space were hours or days of build-up before a short, intense conclusion and she preferred a staff as rested and ready as possible during the former to weight the latter more in her favour. More than one battle had been lost because of the physical and mental fatigue of a crew or leader that had stayed on duty longer than they should have.", "That done, the Thoughtful\u2019s long, chalk-white fingers tapped out notes for a mission update to Force Command and a repeat of her requests to Galhemna \u2013 phrased slightly less as a request \u2013 for more light units . She\u2019d have these sent as soon as this operation was concluded. Given the losses she\u2019d already suffered, keeping her picket and recon squadrons at full strength would be even more important. The enemy was outnumbered, but they were focusing their attacks on her screening and reconnaissance vessels. A battle fleet without adequate scouting was vulnerable to being outflanked, strategically and tactically. A fleet without a screen was even more vulnerable, particularly if there was something that out-ranged them\u2026 something like an enemy Chariot.", "I wonder, then\u2026 The Bastion Leader\u2019s thin lips disappeared as she frowned. \u201cDisconnection,\u201d she said to herself, ignoring the curious look Ukask gave her. She raised her head and gestured for Nasham to approach her dais. The younger man did so, standing next to Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s command throne.", "\u201cMatron?\u201d", "\u201cSubmissive,\u201d she said without looking at him, running reviews of each engagement her task force had had within the system. \u201cDo you still believe this is a trap?\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou do not?\u201d", "\u201cInvida,\u201d she said. \u201cDutiful Burden arrived in-system and ran for the planet. The pickets were drawn out of position chasing it. None of them could react or escape when the enemy arrived. The transport\u2019s course made it appear as if it were going to attack the planet, so Invida Orbital moved to block that approach. The station was the target. Without it, the colony had no support and its contact with the pickets was severed. When the Wound launched its assault, it sent infiltrators to draw off personnel and weaken the outside defences. It feinted and schemed and deceived, but every action fed another stage of its plans. Do you agree with my analysis?\u201d", "Nasham inclined his head. \u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cWe are attacked upon shocking in-system, a simple act of opportunity. We receive a transmission, possibly genuine, of a civilian vessel in distress. We investigate the seventh planet and find an unknown contact, and an ambush. We encounter minefields and these sniping attacks from more stealthed vessels.\u201d She raised one hand in a gesture of uncertainty. \u201cThese operations are individual. There is no synergy. It is a disconnection between intent and capability. Either we are seeing an atypical lack of coordination from the foe\u2019s assets, or the initial conclusion was correct: we have caught them by surprise. As someone who has twice had personal interactions with our quarry, I would have your opinion.\u201d Her near-lipless mouth twitched in something close to a smile. \u201cWith the minimization of metaphor, of course.\u201d", "\u201cOf course.\u201d Nasham gathered his thoughts. He wasn\u2019t being asked for military advice. Even if the Bastion Leader didn\u2019t have many decades of experience on him, there were hundreds of tacticians and strategic analysts across the fleet that she could call upon for that. \u201cYou want to know if the behaviour here fits with what I\u2019ve observed?\u201d There were reams of data on the AI\u2019s interactions with the Compact as well, behavioural analysis, transcripts of messages she\u2019d sent, even psychological evaluations. Many of these were contradictory, as the machine\u2019s actions and words were shrouded in deception. The only constant was her insane, unreasoning hatred\u2026 and she had even weaponized that.", "\u201cNo,\u201d was Nasham\u2019s response. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t. It lacks the...\u201d he struggled for the word. \u201c\u2026efficiency of what she does.\u201d He was silent for several seconds, remembering far too much of the machine\u2019s efficiency. \u201cI don\u2019t believe she\u2019s here. I\u2019m not certain she has done any of what we\u2019re seeing.\u201d", "\u201cI am left wondering,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro replied. \u201cBut as you said, we have little choice but to investigate. We will have to see whether your Dame Fortune has smiled on us, or if we are indeed her toys.\u201d", "\u201cHave you come to any conclusion on that, matron?\u201d", "She stared at him for a second, her horizontal eyelids blinking. \u201cOnly that we will have many more pottery warriors to encounter. Thank you for your input, submissive.\u201d", "Nasham tilted his head, acknowledging his leader\u2019s words before he returned to the station. It would have been too much to hope to find her here, crippled and helpless. But as he studied the engagement, he was left with an unpleasant feeling in the core of his liver. If this was a trap\u2026 what was it leading to?", "~", "Noble Fleet Lord Jirrico of House Soton-ra stood on the lower mezzanine of his almost-palatial office suites. Benches leaned against large planters overgrowing with edible and oxygenating vines that grew up along the support bracers and columns, spreading across the ceiling. There were stairs up to the main level on either end of the horseshoe-shaped mezzanine, with a small conference center at the very tip, just below the fleet lord\u2019s personal work station. The Askanj-anj looked out at the system of Kebrak Daun. Two of his aides waited behind him, ready for his orders. It felt like an eternity, not a matter of days since the shadow ship had arrived from Galhemna. An age, not less than a month when records of what the Compact was doing in that system had come to light. An eon, not a flicker in the universe\u2019s lifespan since the realization that the strange, ugly little creature had been right all those months ago.", "Sundial. Once, a rumour. One of a thousand names and possibilities offered by intelligence teams and strategic minds, no more or less important than any of the others. Then, an ugly possibility offered by a neverborn\u2019s handmaiden.", "The Principality had spent no small amount of time and effort confirming the human\u2019s claim. Shadows were almost as rare as supercarriers and most of them were needed elsewhere, probing the Compact\u2019s forward bases and captured Principality territories for weaknesses, tracking enemy fleets and bringing that vital data back to counter-invasion forces or targeted systems. Jirrico had used up more than one favour to get just one shadow deployed to Galhemna. The fortress system wasn\u2019t on the Argosy\u2019s sensors. Too far from the main lines to be considered a threat, the reports of ship buildups and ongoing construction were put down to the Compact\u2019s need for a centralized Daun-level system on the frontier, and the actions of the Red Hand. If there was one thing the insurgents were good at, Jirrico thought with no small amount of self-awareness, it was provoking a reaction.", "But.", "Pirate-hunting didn\u2019t require a Chariot, let alone three of them. Border security didn\u2019t need a full battlegroup replete with heavy capitals. Fighting insurgents didn\u2019t necessitate the kinds of arms build-up their agent had reported.", "She was right, he thought. Those three words had haunted him for days. The neverborn\u2019s vassal had been right.", "Jirrico\u2019s crests ached. He wanted to deny it, say that there wasn\u2019t enough information to truly know, but they never would. The Compact wasn\u2019t stupid. They\u2019d realized they\u2019d had a breach and they\u2019d scour Galhemna for every trace of infiltrators and spies. The other agents the Principality had managed to insert hadn\u2019t had the Worker\u2019s level of access, and they\u2019d almost certainly either be swept up or go underground. The Compact knew who\u2019d been scouting them. They\u2019d increase production, ramp up security and likely send out more border raids to keep the segments bordering the Black Veil off-balance. Sundial was coming.", "Kebrak Daun was going through its own growth, but it was far behind the output of Galhemna. He had patrol groups, raiding squadrons, battlecruisers and a few battleships. No supercarriers, nor any possibility of getting them completed before those Chariots were operational.", "\u201cNoble Fleet Lord?\u201d his first aide said. She was his niece. She owed her position to his patronage, but she\u2019d kept it through professionalism, diligence, dedication and the ability to keep her mouth closed. She was holding a datascroll. On it was an unfinished letter to Argosy Central Authority. \u201cThe courier is waiting.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Jirrico answered, \u201cI know.\u201d He held out a hand and she stepped forward, handing him the \u2018scroll. He pressed his thumb to the bioscanner and the document unlocked. The Noble Fleet Lord\u2019s eyes skimmed over the body of the text he had written. He had laid everything out for his superiors, from once again recounting the meeting with Leblanc and her new \u2018friends\u2019, the work done to infiltrate Galhemna, copies of Nenkot\u2019s only transmission, passive telemetry from the shadow on its way in and out of the system and the analyses his intelligence divisions had spent days on. The results were obvious.", "Sundial was coming, and the Principality could not hold it back. The war was at a critical stage. They couldn\u2019t take ships off the front lines and if they did, it would be noticed and exploited. Every hull they had under construction was badly needed elsewhere. They didn\u2019t have time to raise a fleet powerful enough to strike at Galhemna before those Chariots and the hundreds of warships being constructed there were ready to deploy. They had resources, oh yes. They had the resources. Just no way to use them before more than a thousand enemy vessels and three damned god-ships obliterated Kebrak Daun and forced their way into the Principality\u2019s vitals, rampaging through under-defended rear areas and vital industry, collapsing defence networks and cutting the front-line fleets off from resupply and support.", "If it was as bad as he thought, as bad as the Broken had indicated, Sundial would be a disastrous tipping point for the Principality. Their new fleets and technologies weren\u2019t ready yet. They were trickling into production, but not enough to make a difference. For that, they needed time\u2026 and the Compact had just taken that from them.", "Jirrico stared at the \u2018scroll. \u201cFate,\u201d he said to himself. His niece raised her head, but she said nothing when it was clear the Noble Fleet Lord wasn\u2019t looking for a discussion. \u201cWould that fate chose someone else to be here, to give them this decision.\u201d It hadn\u2019t, though. It was him here, now. His staff had argued for days, some for, some against with as many reasons for each rationale as he had subordinates, but in the end he was Noble Fleet Lord of Kebrak Segment. He was the only person that could make this decision. He couldn\u2019t wait any longer.", "With a sense of finality, the Askanj-anj fleet lord attached the files the Broken had given him of Chrysalis\u2019s needs and the Red Hand\u2019s wants to the document, typing out a single concluding paragraph. He stared at the final sentence for far too long before handing the \u2018scroll back to his aide. She took it and ran from the room, rushing to deliver it to the waiting courier. The only record of this decision would be personally placed in the hands of Jirrico\u2019s superiors. There would be no other trace of this sin that fate was forcing them to commit.", "Jirrico turned back to the window. Maybe there was another option; maybe there was something he had missed that others knew of. He doubted it, but he still hoped otherwise. It would take time, of course. Such a decision couldn\u2019t be made instantly. Time for his peers and superiors to debate, to argue, to come to the realization that there was no other option. Time to begin amassing the resources. Time to contact the Red Hand and their associates. Time for the machine to repair itself\u2026 and all while the hammers and smiths of Galhemna worked unceasingly.", "There was a myth his people had.

Many legends said that they were the souls of those who\u2019d drowned and to show them kindness would indebt them to you for life. Many stories told of these kind people being rescued from death, being led to treasure or otherwise given gifts by the Drowned.", "There were other stories, too. In these legends, the Drowned weren\u2019t pitiful lost souls, but things turned bitter by the circumstances of their deaths.

Multiple unaccounted-for energy signatures had been detected there. Those could be due to faulty, damaged and unshielded reactors or the operations of the tugs. It was a possibility. Far more likely was the presence of more stealth destroyers, more unclassified cruisers or even something worse. Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro would not let themselves be drawn into yet another ambush. There\u2019d already been too many of those.", "The enemy continued to peck at the fleet, either getting bolder or more desperate as the Compact armada cleared swept through the system. The machine warships had been targeting the outermost augur platforms, cutting out the fleet\u2019s first deadline and shortening their scope horizons. Attack drones swarmed from out of asteroids and moons, somnolent mine platforms went live as ships passed within their range. Their foe had disturbingly effective stealth technology; many times the weapons weren\u2019t detected until they powered up. There\u2019d been no real losses from these attacks, but the Compact armada\u2019s supply of scope platforms was dwindling. Every vessel had to remain on guard, even those that The Writ said were safe in the midst of the fleet.", "Then the enemy blew up a moon.", "Yunl\u2019ro hadn\u2019t lost any ships from that \u2013 not directly, but the AIs hadn\u2019t been trying to use the moon as a weapon. They\u2019d done it as a distraction, a planetary body obliterated as a distraction. They\u2019d sacrificed one of their Splinters to do it, drawing the attention of one of the Compact picket squadrons, luring them out to investigate and then kill the command ship. Then, planetoid a nearly a thousand kilometers in diameter had ignited.", "The detonations had been shaped charges, carefully placed so that when they went off, they blew an entire hemisphere into the path of the Compact fleet, leaving behind only the shattered, wrecked shell of a moon. The squadrons against the Splinter and sweep Husk Five suddenly found two-thirds of a moon hurtling towards them, the release of so much energy and the plethora of pebble to mountain-sized debris making augurs useless. They\u2019d never seen their attackers.", "Three more stealth destroyers, two converted freighters and an unknown type of cruiser. They\u2019d hit the pickets hard, destroying or disabling three of them before a pair of battlecruisers had been able to intercept them. Two of the destroyers and both of the freighters had been take out in short order, and the cruiser badly mauled. It would have been destroyed, save for a fourth destroyer appearing out of nowhere. Blasting scrapcode from its comm system, the malevolent little beast had engaged both battlecruisers in an insane mismatch, with far more aggression and coordination than the rest of its class had shown. The battlecruisers had killed it, but not before it had struck Ambient Presence twice with that monstrous particle cannon, self-destructing in the midst of its killers, causing even more damage to Ambient Presence and blinding its comrade long enough for the cruiser to withdraw into the radioactive field of debris that was left of the moon.", "Strike, retreat. Strike, retreat. Strike, retreat. It was the unspoken mantra of Husk\u2019s defenders. Many of these vessels were using scavenged systems \u2013 the unclassified cruiser that had attacked after the moonbreak had been carrying high-end corporate-rated weaponry \u2013 but others, like the stealth destroyers had technology that had been seen in the Wound itself.", "\u201cThey want to cut out our eyes,\u201d Nasham had observed.", "Yunl\u2019ro couldn\u2019t disagree. The enemy were focusing their strikes on the ships they could actually hurt and they were prosecuting that effort to their utmost. Without her lighter units, the fleet\u2019s battle van would have no pickets or defensive screen and its ability to scout intra- or intersystem would be crippled. It would cost time to replace those, time the enemy would use. Time their targets would have to rebuild, dig in and further fortify any other locations like Husk.", "It was what she would have done, but that made it no more pleasant when it was people, her people, dying to the cold, soulless logic differentials of artificial intelligences. Still, she was becoming more convinced that the Wound and its sibling were not here in Husk, but almost certainly within the nebula. The Echo had done that right, if nothing else. There was no other explanation for this level of build-up and this kind of rabid aggression from the defenders. They were trying to bleed her forces and buy time for their abominate creator to repair itself... and it was working. The beast\u2019s children were already causing losses out of proportion to their own. If it had more time or \u2013 Triarchs forbid \u2013 more resources, it would have an armada. Not merely salvaged and cannibalized vessels, but ships outfitted with the Wound\u2019s horrific technology and driven by echoes of its own insane malevolence. The Thoughtful already knew that that would keep her awake more than one night.", "Looking at the wreckage of a celestial body once more than a thousand kilometers across, Yunl\u2019ro couldn\u2019t help but remember what she\u2019d been told when she\u2019d first been selected for this assignment.", "\u201cIt hates,\u201d Bastion Leader Prime Korvek (and twelve names besides) had said to her in private. \u201cIt hates us more than anything has ever hated. That is the most important thing you can remember about this mission. It hates us.\u201d The old Tribune had had a long and distinguished career and she\u2019d thought he\u2019d given in to flights of fancy in his older, desk-bound years. She was somewhat less certain of that now.", "\u201cMessage from Ancients\u2019 Oath,\u201d Communications called out. \u201cThey are requesting confirmation of the order to disregard Adelain Fortune\u2019s distress.\u201d", "Ancients\u2019 Oath was one of the vessels nominally under the command of Bastion Leader Kemk. Those ships and their officers had not received the same briefings that the execution force\u2019s other leaders had, but they knew enough to fill their roles in Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s line of battle. After she received reinforcements from Force Command, men and women vetted for this duty, Kemk\u2019s fire-eaters would return to Galhemna. The pleas from Adelain Fortune had to be wearing on them more than her own crew. This was a vessel they had known that they\u2019d failed, and now they were being asked to stand aside and let it die to and enemy they knew almost nothing about. The Compact prided itself on the discipline of its military corps. They would not break formation without her authorization, but that did not preclude them from asking.", "Yunl\u2019ro rose from her throne and walked down to the Communications station, personally keying a channel to Ancient\u2019s Oath. \u201cThis is Bastion Leader Yunl\u2019ro,\u201d she said. \u201cOrder is confirmed. Discontinue monitoring all non-fleet transmissions. This is a trap.\u201d She returned to her dais.", "Ukask waited there for her. \u201cBut,\u201d the Tribune said quietly. \u201cWhat if it isn\u2019t?\u201d That was hardly likely, but that was the question the officers and crew of Ancients\u2019 Oath were asking.", "Yunl\u2019ro didn\u2019t consider herself a cold individual. Dispassionate, calculating \u2013 yes. Aware of the costs of her duties and responsibilities? Yes. Not cold or callous. Qobieshii had already been dead. Whether it had been bait or not was immaterial; there\u2019d been nothing that she or any member of the fleet could do for it.", "Adelain Fortune was different. It was dying right now, within arm\u2019s reach. Its hull was swarming with machines cutting their way inside. All it would take is a little more speed and they could reach it. The Wound had used their own people against them before. They could be there. Or there could be nothing.", "\u201cOur adversary detonated a moon,\u201d she reminded her sigil leader, \u201cjust to strike at our pickets. Those ships still moving through the debris are laying mines. That asteroid facility is churning out attack drones.\u201d", "\u201cNot enough to disrupt our fleet,\u201d Ukask said. \u201cIf this distress call is genuine, we can save them. We\u2019ve bled a lot today. It would help morale to have one clean win.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s vertical eyelids narrowed. She knew her sigil leader was speaking as the proverbial seventh man, but it still came across as challenging. \u201cIf,\u201d she pointed out.", "Ukask tilted his head in acknowledgement of the answer and his Bastion Leader\u2019s authority. He had said what needed to be said. A good submissive made sure their superiors considered every possibility, but they did not second-guess. He knew as well as Yunl\u2019ro what the Wound was capable of, but that made this decision no easier to accept. For the good of the many, the few must often be sacrificed. He had reviewed too many operations where leaders diverted from their hunts to respond to a distress call, only for the next plaintive cries to come from them.", "The Bastion Leader remained silent for several moments, thinking much the same thoughts. \u201cDeploy additional scope drones from our reserves,\u201d she ordered. \u201cPush them into the debris. I want eyes in that field.\u201d Yunl\u2019ro let a few more seconds pass as she typed commands out on her console, then blew a breath out through her nostril slits. \u201cHelm, Operations. Download and refine the course from my station and distribute to all ships. Increase acceleration by\u2026\u201d she ran the numbers in her head, as she typed the calculations into her console. The computer\u2019s determination arrived first, in line with her own. \u201cFour percent.\u201d The course correction and change in thrust would be just enough to put the outer edge of their missile envelope over Adelain Fortune as they approached the asteroid base, so that they could shoot down the tugs. If that ship was genuinely under distress, she had given them all she could. Anything more would risk more than she was prepared to. Once the base was destroyed, or in her possession, the liner could be attended to. If it survived that long, and if it was worth saving.", "If.", "She would not charge recklessly. This operation was coming to a head. More annoying intuition, but there was something in that field. Something that no augur had yet seen, but her instincts and her experience told her it was there, and she suspected that she would find out the truth soon.", "~", "The Enemy were cautious. Their course had shifted and they had accelerated, but not with blind urgency. More sensor drones had been launched. They were difficult to track, though the hunter-killers culled more than their fair share. Still, the destination was obvious. They were attempting to sweep the field before they entered it.", "Jor\u014dgumo let them. She knew what they were seeing.", "Just enough.", "~", "\u201cTriarch\u2019s bones,\u201d someone on the bridge whispered.", "Nasham couldn\u2019t have said it better. The enemy might not have had much time to fortify this system, but they had done more than he had thought they could, even without Nemesis or Redemption of Sol. The grinding trudge through this system, sweeping from planet to planet in a winding, circuitous route had taken days. Days of constant, unpredictable attacks. Days of losses that, while far from crippling, were still nonetheless injurious. Days of fitful, restless sleep, too much jakhaa in his stomach and that crawling icy sensation in his liver, wondering if this encounter would be when she finally revealed herself.", "But she wouldn\u2019t. She wasn\u2019t here. She spoke to her enemy, telling them what she wanted, what she intended. Mocking them and reaffirming a hatred that was older than many civilizations. Husk was silent. The warships they faced offered nothing. This system was void of anything but corpses, carrion and children. Her children, built from the bodies of murdered ships, or constructed according to her own designs. Debased, degenerate and just as hateful as their mother.", "The sole thing of worth in this system, the construction facility built into a hunk of rock the size of a small moon, had been working nonstop since the machines had spotted the Compact\u2019s probes, vomiting out munitions. Going merely by what their scopes could see, the enemy had over three thousand warheads and platforms drifting in orbit of the facility ready for use. That base was the fleet\u2019s primary target now, the only thing of value left in this Black-touched system. The remaining ships, from tenders, minelayers and Q-ships to the combat units seen elsewhere, had clustered around the facility, though most of the latter were concealed by shrouds and the presence of their fellows. Almost all of the remaining ships. There was still no trace of the titan-scale vessel detected around Husk Seven. Current analysis suggested that it was either a freighter equipped with scope bafflers and holo-imagers, or something similar to what the enemy had done before: several vessels flown so close that they appeared as one to augurs. Even if it had been present, by most measures this was a pathetically small defence force \u2013 perhaps two dozen ships against more than a hundred, but those two dozen ships were outfitted with as much ordnance as they could hold, using systems and technologies generations ahead of the Compact\u2019s own. They could never win, but they could do what their monstrous creator had done for millennia: make their enemy hurt.", "As long as this thing lives, that wound will never heal. We shall always bleed. Those had been the final words of Column Leader Anselm, from which the abomination\u2019s name had come. Nasham looked at the scope telemetry from the industrial facility, at the clouds of attack drones, external missile racks, recently-constructed silos and batteries dotting its surface.", "A handful of ships and a single small factory had done all this in weeks. Nasham felt the cold sensation in his liver worsen at the thought of what she could do with more resources at her disposal. But, an inner voice that sounded all too much like hers whispered, I do, don\u2019t I? You gave me a sister.", "Triarch\u2019s bones indeed, Nasham thought. The bitch-thing had told him that her right to destroy everything his people had was greater than their right to have it. The same could be said for them. They were alive; she was not. They, and every other soul in the galaxy, had more rights than the maddened offspring of a fallen nation.", "You built this, he said to the voice. And we\u2019re going to take it from you. All of it.", "Even if they had to bleed to do it. Even if they had to ignore a voice calling to them, and begging them for help. The bleeding had to be stopped.", "~", "Adelain Fortune was getting desperate. The machines on its hull had breached several places and there was fierce fighting in the outer decks as crew and passengers used the small arsenal the liner carried for its proctors, and whatever improvised weapons they had been able to fashion during the months of their imprisonment.", "That was what they were being told, at least.", "There were two more attacks as the execution force drew closer to the field and the asteroid facility, but neither caused any appreciable damage and the vessels responsible were rapidly driven off. Yunl\u2019ro watched as the faint blue field of the fleet\u2019s missile envelope pushed slowly but steadily out towards the liner. There were jamming platforms in the debris, flickering on and off in apparently random patterns, turning swathes of the field into static-obscured hashes. Visual augurs attempted to pick out hostile movements, but the enemy\u2019s stealth technology and chameleon hulls made that nearly impossible.", "The execution force was at the outer edge of the asteroid belt now, the boundary differentiated from open space by a few more pieces of stellar debris per cubic light-second then \u2018open\u2019 space. Even at its densest, it would be rare to pass within visual distance of just one rock. Asteroid fields rarely presented any hazard to navigation. Of course, that presumed that no one had been dragging mineral-rich asteroids to new locations for easier harvesting. It assumed that hundreds of dead ships and pieces of them had not been left to drift like corpses washed out of a flooded graveyard.", "Five planets had been scoured for any trace of their quarry or any hint to their presence. Two remained. Two\u2026 and this assembly of rocks and dead ships that spread throughout the system. The remaining worlds were sun-scorched and barren, without satellites or any trace industry. Yunl\u2019ro doubted that they would present any real difficulty. Much of the this field was void of hostile contacts. Only Adelain Fortune and the asteroid base were left. The last true battle of Husk would take place here, among the dead.", "\u201cTwo hours, twenty minutes until the facility is in firing range,\u201d Tactical reported. Every moment that passed gave their foe more time to prepare. No one knew what they could do in two hours that they had not already done, but no one wanted to find out. No more cautious probing and feinting. It would be a direct, overwhelming assault.", "Still the pleading calls of people being slaughtered continued. The fleet was not listening. The liner was too far from their true target, surrounded by a thicket of asteroids and dead starships. Anything that went in would have to decelerate to avoid collisions, making them easier targets. If the fleet diverted, they would expose their flank to a sally. The priority was to secure the system. Then they would see what Adelain Fortune was.", "\u201cMatron,\u201d Scopes called out, catching the Thoughtful\u2019s attention. \u201cEnemy tugs have increased thrust.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro turned in her chair. \u201cTactical.\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019ll reach Adelain Fortune twenty-three minutes before we can range on them.\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019ll pull it apart just like they did with Qobieshii,\u201d Ukask growled.", "\u201cYes,\u201d the Bastion Leader agreed. \u201cThey will.\u201d", "Several minutes passed in the relative quiet of Light of Judgement\u2019s command deck.

Nasham recognized that manner of speech. It was what a human female sounded like speaking Standard. There was a wet, liquid giggle, the piping chirps of human laughter. \u201cWe kept them. We knew you would come. Can you hear them?\u201d it repeated. It didn\u2019t sound like Nemesis. It sounded younger, less stable\u2026 worse. Nasham\u2019s liver was a solid lump of ice in his body as this new abomination continued in a tone of insane, seductive glee. \u201cWatch them,\u201d it entreated. \u201cI want you to watch. They see you. They know.\u201d Again, that soft, ugly, mad titter. \u201cThey know you won\u2019t save them.\u201d", "They were too far out for a real-time conversation, but the Bastion Leader had no inclination to reply. There was nothing she had to say. \u201cDo we have a source on that signal?\u201d she asked Communications.", "\u201cNo, matron. It was a wide-beam broadcast. Attempting to triangulate, but it looks like there are multiple origin points. We can\u2019t localize them through the jamming.\u201d", "\u201cBouncing the signal off satellites,\u201d Ukask observed. \u201cKeeping us from getting a fix on their location.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro turned to Nasham. The younger man\u2019s hands were curled into fists, his nails dug deeply into his palms. \u201cIs that our quarry?\u201d she asked.", "\u201cNo,\u201d he answered, confirming the Thoughtful\u2019s suspicions. It wasn\u2019t the Wound. This was one of its children, speaking for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s something else.\u201d", "Something else. That possibility was an uncomfortable one, and it threw the Bastion Leader\u2019s calculations into disarray. \u201cWhy is it talking to us now?\u201d she demanded.", "\u201cBecause we\u2019re finally close enough to see the show sh- it is putting on,\u201d he told the Thoughtful.", "\u201cIt wants us to watch it kill those people just before we can save them,\u201d Ukask growled.", "Nasham tipped his head in acknowledgment. \u201cIt might want that,\u201d he agreed. To show them that no matter what they\u2019d done, they were still helpless when it or its \u2018mother\u2019 decided to play their games. \u201cOr it might still be trying to lure us.\u201d", "In celestial terms, the debris field was extremely dense. Between the amount of flotsam and the heavy jamming fields, there could be almost anything in there. The data feeds from the drones had already detected several dozen weapons platforms and drifting warheads. The fleet had taken damage from mines left in open space. In the much closer confines of the debris field, where sight lines and fire arcs would be limited, any vessel that had to cut thrust to safely navigate would be even more vulnerable.", "The execution force was rapidly approaching the point of no return; they would either have to commit to engaging the asteroid facility or divert to Adelain Fortune.", "\u201cBastion Leader,\u201d Communications spoke up. \u201cMessage from Ancient\u2019s Oath. Leader Kenla is requesting your blessing.\u201d", "\u201cMy blessing,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro said flatly. Not her permission.", "\u201cYes, matron. He has repeated his request to attempt to rescue Adelain Fortune. He has also asked that I remind you that his direct superior is Bastion Leader Kemk, and he and his units are only provisionally assigned to your task force.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro looked from her sigil leader to Nasham. That message had changed things. The Wound had never taunted its foes in that manner; its sadism was more pragmatically applied. It hated, as Korvek had put it. It hated enough to prosecute a war for two thousand years. It left beacons broadcasting distress calls and intercepted transmissions of ships that had failed to kill it. It used deceit to lure battle groups into its traps. It desecrated the dead. It had mocked its opponents, challenged them, laughed at them\u2026 but it had never murdered noncombatants in this manner, nor shown this level of sickness and pleasure. But this\u2026 this was neither Wound nor Echo, and with that came a sliver of uncertainty. It had to be a trap. It should be. But there was a new variable in the equations. New evidence shifted the parameters of what they \u2018knew\u2019.", "\u201cOur battle line should be more than enough to handle that base,\u201d Ukask pointed out. \u201cIf Kenla wishes to eat fire, he can do so. And if Adelain Fortune is truly a ship Gravestone kept alive\u2026\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro nodded. She didn\u2019t want to let Kenla go, particularly after that near-challenge to her authority, but Ukask was correct. Things had changed. Once the asteroid base fell, Yunl\u2019ro had no doubt the enemy forces would withdraw, skittering back into the shadows. Whatever was there needed to be located before that happened. At the absolute minimum, it would provide them with more information. Either they would know that the distress call was genuine, or the rest of the fleet would see why they were not to respond to such entreaties in the future. In either case, they would gain the measure of this new threat. They would force it to show itself.", "It was a cold decision, but a pragmatic one.", "\u201cInform Leader Kela that he and his unit are free to advance. He is to expect heavy resistance. If he reaches Adelain Fortune before it is destroyed, he may attempt recovery operations and conduct a sweep of the field. However, he is to exercise extreme caution and withdraw the instant the situation becomes overly hostile. Be sure to remind him that he will do no good to anyone if he dies in vainglory.\u201d She paused briefly. \u201cCommunicate to Column Leader Xi\u2019kanis that the Golden Shields will follow Leader Kenla and provide support.\u201d she paused, looking again at the spread of hostile weapons systems waiting for her ships. \u201cThe enemy encourages us to split our forces. We shall do the same.\u201d A full squadron of battlecruisers might be overcautious, the foe had been preying on her lighter units. It was time for them to face something far heavier than cruisers and escorts. Now, if what hidden enemy wanted to strike, it would have to make choices of its own.

Augur screens lit up as the Compact warships triggered attack protocols in the defensive positions, but the damage their preliminary bombardment had caused was substantial. Kenla made it nearly a third of the way to Adelain Fortune before any substantial resistance was encountered, emboldening him further.", "By virtue of leading the charge, or perhaps the recipients of the machines\u2019 strategy of targeting the fleet\u2019s weakest vessels, Kenla\u2019s ships drew the bulk of the fire. From Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s position on Light of Judgement, it was as if the debris field itself had come alive, turned into a monstrous beast. Hyperbole and metaphor. The field wasn\u2019t alive.

The tugs had almost reached Adelain Fortune. Defences hardened. Attack drones boiled out of gutted hulks. Missiles leapt a few hundred thousand kilometers to attack the cruisers.

Adelain Fortune was left out for all to see, the wounded man left to beg for help. Unable to bear the cries of the dying any longer, Column Leader Kenla had acted out of compassion. His duty was to protect the peoples of the Veiled Reaches from Askanj, Unbound and terrorists, and to be forced to listen to a vessel that he knew he could save was more than he could bear. He was a bold commander, aggressive in temperament and combative in personality, but at his core he was a good man.", "He died for that.", "His cruisers were struck again and again by attack drones, mines and missiles, his squadron shouldering each of them aside, point defences blazing a path as they raced to Adelain Fortune before the tugs could reach it.

All communication with the liner had ceased, its lightless hull still moving with obscene machine forms.", "The column leader fought valiantly, clustering his ships around the liner to protect it, his point defences and heavier weaponry tearing through the cloud of debris around them, culling dozens of the enemy weapons, but there were dozens more. Patriarch\u2019s Command went dark as its main power failed. Torrament\u2019s shields catastrophically failed. Thrusting Gladius lost helm control, but the enemy attack started to fade as the Golden Shields entered support range of their fellows, the battlecruisers brushing aside the barrage, smashing through wreckage and dead hulks as they surrounded Kenla\u2019s ships, interceptor missiles flashing and weaving to strike down launch platforms before they could fire, point defences eradicating incoming warheads, buying the ships a momentary respite.", "Column Leader Xi\u2019kanis politely but forcefully suggested it was time to leave. It had been what the fleet\u2019s command had feared from the very beginning.

It was fair to say that his impetuousness was responsible for putting his ships in that position, and if he had not pressed to rescue Adelain Fortune, the Bastion Leader might not have sent a foray into the debris, but claims that had he acted on Xi\u2019kanis\u2019s advice and withdrawn the moment it became clear that Adelain Fortune was unresponsive, his squadron and the Golden Shields could have escaped were\u2026 overly optimistic.", "The Compact had met Shaushka.

Jor\u014dgumo was not a single vessel. It was a collective, and Violet Five was its hive mind, the AI\u2019s gestalt splintering as it had extended from its original single hull to the rest of Jor\u014dgumo. Its primary hull was where the greatest part Violet Five lay, but she no longer thought of herself as a discrete entity, stretched along laser links and spread throughout the bodies of all of her ship selves. She had begun with six, each of them the size of a battleship, their obelisk-like hulls covered in parts of the dead like an assassin bug\u2019s coat of ants, indistinguishable from the rest of the debris. During her creation, she/they had been modified with another three cruiser-sized selves, with the ability to add more to her/their network, but after the incident, those plans had been shelved and Violet Five had gone to sleep, dreaming and hearing her own voices whisper to one another.", "Jor\u014dgumo had lain dormant for years, finally roused and finally unleashed. There was no longer any need to wait, to lure, to watch. Now, it was time to kill. Power surged from the primary hull through Jor\u014dgumo\u2019s systems, racing through conduits, capacitors and generator systems as their own reactors ignited, feeding even more power to them. Radiation and energy emissions spiked as Violet Five\u2019s selves vented excess waste into space. Maneuvering thrusters fired as each starship adjusted its position.", "No vessel could survive the rigours of modern combat without some form of protection beyond their hull. There were many and varied methods of doing so, from gravitic manipulation, refractory trenches to those systems employed by, among others, the Compact of Species, the Askanj Principality and the United Earth Confederacy. Each nation\u2019s implementation of the technology was different, but the underlying principles were the same. An energy barrier to hold back, weaken and attenuate incoming energy fire and intercept mass rounds. Every starship and installation, from the smallest corvette to the largest war citadels, carried these. Many planets had theater screens to protect certain regions from hostile bombardment or catastrophic accidents. The most well-protected worlds could even create planetary screens as they were able to have far more, and larger power generators than anything in space. There were still limits; a planetary defence screen was not a single field like those a starship or station could produce, but many individual projections layered so closely that they might as well have been one. No one had ever been able to create a screen more than a few dozen kilometers in size.", "Jor\u014dgumo\u2019s primary and secondary selves created 14 shield facings, each tens to hundreds of thousands of kilometers across.

It has a breach core.\u201d That could have been intuition \u2013 the Wound used one, after all. It was not. The computer\u2019s own analysis had isolated telltale signatures indicative of an ongoing shockspace breach, very similar to those recorded during engagements with the Wound. There were only two instances in which the Compact had been able to detect that from their quarry; when it was severely damaged and its shielding systems and hull were compromised\u2026 or when it was utilizing far more power than normal.", "\u201cBlackened throne,\u201d Ukask swore as he brought up the data himself. \u201cTo be detectable from here, even through all that augur hash... it must be using more power than\u2026\u201d he trailed off, unable to conceive of any adequate analogy. \u201cIt has to be unstable,\u201d he finished instead.

In many regards, \u2018Riskier\u2019 than causing a shockspace breach was a difficult concept to envision. The Compact\u2019s one practical application of that technology had been nearly two thousand years ago, when they had attempted to reverse-engineer a captured human Chariot.

The enemy ships had completed their vector change and were coming for Light of Judgement and its escorts, the hollows spread open like the fangs of an ungalat\u2019s circle mouth and intending to envelop the squadron. Both sides were jockeying for position; the enemy vessels were attempting to create a prism where Light of Judgement would pulverize itself against their screens just as Dawnhammer and Volken Knight had. The Chariot and its battleships were attempting to get close enough and avoid that. It would be difficult, but there was no finer crew in all the Space Force.

Not every crewer could be strapped in, or fast enough to do so. Not every piece of cargo would stay anchored. Not every item would have been stowed properly. A man Ukask had come up through the Academy with had died that way. Someone hadn\u2019t fully secured a locker and when the ship had had to make a crash deceleration, the drawers had come loose and one of the tools inside flew out of the locker, through the compartment and split his head open.

Even leaving aside the milling crowd of drones protecting them, far too few of the Compact\u2019s attacks got through. Those that did had no effect on those Black-touched screens of theirs. Those ships were nothing but defences, screens, engines\u2026 and those siege cannons. Even the cruiser-sized vessels were proving inordinately difficult to damage. Twice, the squadron had brought down their screens, but twice the damned things had brought them back up within seconds. Reset screens.

Barely any time at all, and yet\u2026", "\u201cEyes on that dispersal,\u201d Ukask said, shifting his own chair. Every station on the bridge, from the Bastion Leader\u2019s command throne to the lowliest rating\u2019s duty seat, doubled as a crash couch, blending status and functionality. \u201cIf they get within a light-second, they\u2019re preparing to close that screen right on top of us.\u201d That would be an embarrassing fate; making a daring assault on the enemy AIs, only to be splattered like bugs against a windscreen. He\u2019d said as much to the Bastion Leader.", "\u201cThat prism requires a massive energy expenditure,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro had replied, in that calm, Thoughtful tone of hers. \u201cEnergy they cannot seem to provide while under thrust. As well, those ships must be perfectly synchronized with each other and the command unit. They cannot be while out of real-time range.  If they stop accelerating, they allow us to define the engagement. They must close, as we must. At these speeds, even an AI would find it difficult to stop engines, redirect power and bring up that web before any window of opportunity to\u2026 \u2018splatter\u2019 us,\u201d she said with a small grin of amusement, \u201cis past.

The enemy did the same. Move and counter-move, nearly two dozen ships dancing as they sped through space at thousands of kilometers a second. In some ways, it was almost intimate. Then again, what was more intimate than two fighters standing against each other, each knowing that death could be the only outcome?", "Every second that passed, the net drew tighter and the enemy closed. They still hadn\u2019t identified the command ship. Its breach core wasn\u2019t operating at full capacity now, and the communications traffic between the various vessels was incredibly dense, making it impossible to isolate the primary vessel. They\u2019d managed to intercept some of the transmissions. It was dense information packets. Machine language. Impossible to decode, using encryption sequences and code keys developed by the soulless, lifeless minds in those vessels. The Compact had only rarely been able to decipher the Wound\u2019s data bursts. Virtually every time they had, it was either false intel or had eventually led into a trap. The few times it was valid might simply be to keep them wasting time and effort and leading themselves right into its guns.", "Just as they were doing now, he supposed.

She/they was becoming whole once more.

The time between detection and action was too small to trust to an organic\u2019s response. The Chariot\u2019s computer had taken control, its datalinked orders to the battleships with it initiating the same actions within them as well. It had been directed to match deceleration with the enemy the instant their thrust changed and it carried out that command to the limits of its abilities, overriding nearly all other priorities, safety margins and crew welfare protocols. It had been told that for now, all of those expendable. If it could not arrest those ships\u2019 momentum, they would all die and those imperatives would be moot. It had been given orders. It would succeed.", "Inertial forces pressed against hundreds of thousands of crew as countless millions of tonnes of metal struggled to avoid the fate of Dawnhammer and Volken Knight. Primary drives shut down as the vessels flipped end for end, thrusters burning so hard that they destroyed themselves in a desperate attempt to help dump velocity. The maneuvers took long moments; multiple kilometers of ship didn\u2019t roll quickly or easily. One by one, the splinter group\u2019s ships completed their turns, Light of Judgement last of all, and their main drives came back online. Inertial dampeners struggled to reduce the hundreds of gs pressing in on their crew and cargo to something survivable. Most of them succeeded. Some did not, but despite the damage and casualties caused, the squadron remained combat-effective.", "All around them, Jor\u014dgumo\u2019s selves were carrying out similar maneuvers. They had no crew to concern themselves with, but their prototype systems were delicate and they had to maintain appropriate both spacing from each other and distance from the enemy ships. If any one of thousands of variables was off, this operation would fail. Weavers and warships fell together, each one ready to kill the other, each one racing to finish their task first.", "Jor\u014dgumo succeeded. Not by enough to cause the Enemy to smash into her/their screens, but enough to seal them inside the shield web. Her/their primary self\u2019s breach core was wrenched open wider than its creator had ever used hers and power bled from the dark obelisk, diverted into the nearest of Violet Five\u2019s selves and to transmission satellites to feed the rest. As the Compact warships finished their flips, the web came to life, energy fields stretching across hundreds of thousands of kilometers to once again form a convex polyhedron. Within the prism, the Compact warships threw all power to their screens, knowing what was coming.", "The first plasma mortar burst slammed against the screens of Headsman\u2019s Axe. The battleship absorbed that damage, warning klaxons howling in protest. Each vessel could survive three, four, perhaps five such impacts before their screens failed. Then, they would be hers. Then, they would burn.", "~", "\u201cDo we have a target?\u201d Yunl\u2019ro demanded.

Another plasma burst arced into her squadron. The only saving grace was those weapons\u2019 slow rate of fire. Her ships were firing back, but the enemy vessels were well protected and the firing slits in their screens only opened for microseconds to allow each bolus of plasma through.

Her ships rolled to present stronger screens to the enemy, but even that was a stopgap. Compact screens were a single, discrete field that surrounded each ship. That geometry made them far stronger than the defences of other nations as they had more surface area to bleed off energy through, but there was a weakness. When they failed, they failed in totality.", "Power was being rerouted, weaponry focused at whichever hostile was readying itself to fire, forcing it to keep its screen intact, but even with a Chariot and more than two dozen battleships firing, they couldn\u2019t stop every launch. The enemy ships\u2019 hulls were too thick and they were willing to accept some damage to hammer the Compact ships. If they could land a direct hit, the Compact warships could even disrupt the plasma rounds\u2019 magnetic envelope and cause it to burst, turning a single deadly impact into a more widely-dispersed plume. Those shots were hard to target, though. Each round was not quite light-speed, but far, far faster than any missile and the splinter group\u2019s targeting augurs were already half-blind from the massive energy field surrounding them.", "Shadowed Name was the first to die. Beating the odds, it had taken five of those monstrous impacts before its screens failed, leaving the battleship exposed. The battleship tried to sink back into the formation until it could restore screens, but it wasn\u2019t fast enough.", "In exchange for a single deep score across its sloped prow, one of the enemy platforms fired on Shadowed Name, the round roiling out, flashing through everything the Compact warships could throw at it to reduce the forward fifth of the battleship to vapour. That injury was survivable, had Shadowed Name remained under control and slipped between its comrades, but through injury or panic, it lost helm control and veered off course, making itself an easy target for the next blast that sheared it in half.", "\u201cDo we have a target?\u201d Yunl\u2019ro repeated calmly as her ships began to die.", "\u201cI\u2026 yes!

They were hurting it. Screen strength was fluctuating wildly. It had to be desperate, drawing on every last reserve it had to keep those screens up. It was still drawing more power from its breach core. Even the brief interlude between failure and reset could be irrevocably damaging.

It might even have been able to win, or at least successfully disengage.", "If.", "There was a power spike aboard Light of Judgement, one completely unfamiliar to Violet Five. She had an instant of confusion.", "+what-+", "Light of Judgement was not like other Chariots. It was built from the hull of the Compact\u2019s heaviest and most advanced design of dreadnought, the Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment class, but it carried several non-standard modifications. The first and foremost of which was the massive disruptor cannon slung under its command core, running nearly the full length of the vessel and feeding directly from the Chariot\u2019s primary reactor.", "Disruptor technology was a relatively new development; short-ranged and with little to no effect against screens, it was most commonly seen in the baleblades used by Compact Janissaries and Askanj Legionnaires. These created a field that, true to its name, disrupted matter at the molecular level around a suit-mounted blade, allowing these weapons to hew through armour, bulkheads and virtually anything else they encountered. A directed-energy version had been used across the Compact fleet for more than a generation, where the field itself was the weapon, shattering the atomic bonds of even the heaviest armour and eviscerating starships in an instant.", "The energy required to sustain a disruption field increased exponentially with the size of the field; with few exceptions, they could only be utilized at either end of that curve. A disruption field could be readily fed from a suit of power armour, and a starship\u2019s reactors could feed disruptor batteries. Very little in between those two extremes could do so. And if they could, the benefits were dubious. Anything a disruptor did, another weapon could almost certainly do easier and cheaper. Until recently, they had remained a niche weapon, utilized by troops to facilitate boarding and close combat operations and as a close-range coup de grace in naval combat.", "The introduction of the Toxic Vector-class assault boat had been the first shift away from that doctrine. The development of the disruption lance was another. Unlike its short-ranged brethren aboard Light of Judgement and the rest of the Compact armada, the lance had an effective range of just under three hundred thousand kilometers. There were complications with the design, of course. First and foremost, it was largely considered unnecessary. The Compact only rarely encountered warships of a similar caliber to its own; even the Askanj Argosy\u2019s supercarriers were easily dispatched once their barriers were brought down or sufficiently holed. With most other hostile militaries not requiring a dreadnought-killing problem solver, the lance\u2019s greatest selling point was that it was most effective against other Chariots. Consequently, it had been left on the drawing board for years. Production had only begun half a decade ago, Force Command overriding all doctrinal and political objections to the lance\u2019s development. Moving from theoretical to practical had been difficult; there had been multiple technical issues to overcome and Light of Judgement\u2019s completion had been repeatedly delayed as engineering teams struggled to get an operational (and safe) prototype through construction, testing and trials.", "The lance\u2019s performance against any active screens would be considered dubious at best, but it had never been intended for that. As it had passed from concept to reality, the role of the disruption lance had been changed from a Chariot-killer of uncertain tactical value to a weapon that could destroy a dreadnought in less than a second. The briefest gap in an opponent\u2019s shield was all it needed.", "As it had now.", "Jor\u014dgumo\u2019s primary self and the largest part of Violet Five\u2019s mind was sheared apart at the molecular level. No armour could have resisted that and four and a half kilometers of starship vanished in the blink of an eye. No longer held open or being drawn towards a catastrophic release, the forced shockspace breach it used to power itself collapsed in on itself like a failed shockpoint, though the energy from its self-annihilation was\u2026 rather more violent, radiation cascades and gravitic surges buffeting the Compact warships, but not enough to truly harm them.", "Without the power from their primary self\u2019s core, the rest of Jor\u014dgumo could not maintain the web and it collapsed within seconds. Likewise, the plasma mortars could not sustain their charge and the remaining five selves of Jor\u014dgumo were forced to launch immediately. The damage to Light of Judgement was minimal. Its screens were strained but remained intact.", "As the Compact vessels realized what had happened and brought their weapons to bear on the rest of Jor\u014dgumo, the fragmented remains of Violet Five made one last decision, carrying out a protocol Command had buried deep in her/their mind. While the platforms\u2019 reactors were not sufficient to power the shield web, when induced to a critical failure, they were more than enough to reduce each of Jor\u014dgumo\u2019s selves to dispersing clouds of dust. Without power from the primary\u2019s breach core, they could not fight back effectively. They could not be taken intact.", "Aboard Light of Judgement, there was a moment of stunned silence, then one of celebration. Yunl\u2019ro let it continue a few seconds more than necessary. \u201cDamage reports from all sections,\u201d she ordered. \u201cReady repair and recovery teams for dispatch to the Burning Thrones and Brilliant Wrath.

Do we have an update on the rest of the fleet\u2019s disposition?\u201d", "Her crew shifted back into dutiful professionalism, contacting other departments and the rest of the vessels with Light of Judgement. Reports were quick to come in. Their losses had been light. Column Leader Ulin\u2019et had ably coordinated the fleet from Praetor\u2019s Oath and the remaining enemy warships had been destroyed or routed. The asteroid base had been disarmed, but just as its counterpart here had, whatever mind operated that facility chose death over defeat. Its suicide had been less dramatic, though: multiple high-yield scuttling charges from within the complex had ignited, breaking the asteroid apart and destroying much, if not all, of its technology.", "Husk now belonged to the Compact.", "Of their enemy, only ashes remained."]}

An unassuming small white star with a handful of planets one hundred and eighty-four light-years from Sol, it had been one of the farthest-reaching colonies of the United Earth Confederacy, a small beacon of light in the darkness. Now, two thousand years later, it was a simple, lifeless star system on the edge of a sector of space known as the Kaedan Vault. Oddly, it still bore the portmanteau name its original inhabitants had given it, though this was due to a clerical error and the lack of understanding behind the term. Other than that, there was almost nothing left of humanity\u2019s presence in the Gatriaus system.", "Aside from a smattering of largely unremarkable planets, there was only one celestial body of any note in Gatriaus; the massive moon that orbited the system\u2019s fourth planet, a gas dwarf. The planet itself had been called Isabelle, named for Isabelle Vallejo, the youngest daughter of the discovery team, and a victim of the last known outbreak of the Red Death. The plague had driven a cloistered, inwardly-focused humanity out into the stars and it had seemed fitting that one of the most distant colonies humanity would ever found be named for one of the plague\u2019s final casualties.", "Isabelle Minor had been the largest moon of the gas dwarf, slightly larger than Mercury, with its own magnetosphere and oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, though the latter was too thin for human habitation and the moon\u2019s mean temperature was only somewhat above freezing. A sweltering summer\u2019s day on Isabelle Minor\u2019s equator might be about 15 degrees Celsius.", "Overall, Isabelle Minor was a cold, windswept moon, but it had had life. Simple lichens and fungi had spread across its surface, growing out of its shallow, frigid seas. Bacterial biofilms had developed into eukaryotic microbial colonies that rose from the substrate like termite mounds, extending mucous-filled tendrils packed with phagocytes towards other colonies, waging slow, single-celled battles of attrition against competitors, growing over the fallen and devouring them to fuel their own creeping growth. Life was simple and moved slowly on Isabelle Minor, but it nonetheless existed, as strange and wonderful as anything else in the cosmos, unique in all the universe.", "When they arrived, the first wave of colonists had erected several domed cities to keep the frigid winds and spreading microbial mats alike outside and away from their living spaces. A small population of a hundred thousand researchers, pioneers, explorers and homsteaders had called Isabella Minor home. The planned follow-up waves to expand humanity\u2019s presence never arrived. The Confederacy\u2019s first and only interstellar war against the power known as the Compact of Species ended all exploration efforts. Gatriaus was captured early on in the conflict; too small, too undeveloped and too distant from Earth to mount a credible attempt to re-take it. Much as the human settlers had joked that their home was a planet-wide Petri dish, their cities became experiments themselves as their conquerors strove to understand this new species and develop methods of social engineering to control the populace.", "It didn\u2019t take long for resentment amongst the humans to boil over into riots and from there, to rebellion. They had little chance of success, but that didn\u2019t deter them. Every soldier their foe had to station here was one less available on the front lines. Their opponents grew increasingly frustrated and harsh in their attempts to suppress the insurgency on Isabelle Minor and estimates suggested that prior to the war\u2019s end, nearly twenty percent of the population had been killed in the conflict.", "That number reached one hundred percent in the closing days of the war. At first, the enemy\u2019s complete withdrawal from the cities was cause for celebration and cautious optimism. Rumours swirled of a Confederate counter-attack, an armistice or some other pressure forcing the alien presence off of Isabelle Minor. The true reason became frightfully clear all too soon.", "Kinetic rounds breached the city domes, but even that wasn\u2019t enough. Pre-set explosives hidden in bunkers and buildings detonated, accompanied by a precision bombardment that targeted emergency shelters and airtight facilities, ensuring that every possible site was open to Isabelle Minor\u2019s cold, asphyxiating atmosphere. Panic set in as the survivors rushed blindly through the streets, unable to breathe the frigid, thin air of the world outside their domes, stumbling and scurrying about in a desperate rush for safety. There was none. The Compact prided itself on efficiency, whether it was through streamlining transport routes, or conducting lamentably necessary reprisals against uncivilized peoples.", "Reducing an entire population to a gasping death was not the totality of Isabelle Minor\u2019s punishment. A set of missiles launched, deploying from silos on the planet\u2019s surface itself. As the choking, freezing survivors watched in horror, the missiles ascended high into the atmosphere, spreading to every corner of the globe before detonating in viral airbursts and unleashing Isabelle Minor\u2019s final judgement.", "Nearly two hundred light-years ago, the war had ended. Earth had fallen. No one on Isabelle Minor knew it, but their countrymen had fought valiantly for more than a decade, making the enemy bleed for every world and every victory, but it had not been enough. In desperation, the Confederacy had turned to sciences and technologies left buried in archives and sealed under presidential orders. With these, they forged a weapon unlike any other and used it to strike down a god, a victory that sent shock waves through their foe\u2026 and in doing so, sealed their fate.", "The insanity and aggression of the humans ran too deep to be countered or controlled. The situation on Isabelle Minor was a perfect microcosm of the situation elsewhere: the human rebellion was too violent, too uncontrollable. All attempts to bring civilization to the human nation were constantly met with violence, brutality and murder.", "Garrisoning these worlds would cost billions of lives and countless resources, all for a species that had proved its barbarous nature time and time again, proving it beyond all doubt with the sin they\u2019d committed and what they\u2019d made. A decision was made. The Compact\u2019s verdict was a simple one. Extinction.", "Upon every captured world, every still-defiant colony and every remnant of humanity, the will of the Compact was enacted. Isabelle Minor was no exception. Its extermination was carried out with ruthless pragmatism.", "With the missiles\u2019 detonations, a hellish bioweapon was unleashed into the atmosphere. Within minutes, all life on Isabelle Minor ended. Gasping colonists fell to the ground, their flesh necrotizing and decaying. Parents held onto their children as if they could protect them. Spouses, lovers and siblings clutched to one another. Friends, rivals and enemies died together, or alone. Lichen withered. Towering microbe colonies trembled and collapsed. The seas died slowly as the bioweapon dispersed through them, killing everything it encountered.", "Life in the galaxy was a precious thing. Rarer than anything else and all forms of it on Isabelle Minor had just been extinguished. The lesson was far more important.", "The proper story was established. Few knew the true pattern of events; most knew what they were told. All attempts at reason had failed. The racial madness of humanity had pushed the Compact to this point. Reason had failed. Co-existence was impossible. Garrisoning dozens of worlds would require billions of soldiers and countless resources, all while suffering attack after attack, as Isabelle Minor proved. No other options were left and so, for the safety and security of the Compact and all other peoples throughout the galaxy, the human threat had to be eliminated.", "Even in this, the humans remained barbarous: as a final act of spite, the humans poisoned their own world in order to deny it to their foes. It was a good story. It fit the narrative. The racial insanity of the humans, their spitefulness, their blind, unreasoning aggression. There was no choice.", "That was the story told, and all the facts supported it, of course. It became a lesson of just one of the many threats the Compact faced and why a safe and secure society was necessary. There were predators among the stars, and not all of them could be reasoned with, and when diplomacy failed, the Compact would be there to protect its citizens and vassals. It was good story. Most of it was even true\u2026 from a certain point of view.", "Centuries passed. The bioweapon, long since inert, was no longer an impediment to colonization. The story of humanity\u2019s fall faded from memory, a minor piece of history of no import to anyone outside of scholars and researchers. What was left of the domed cities and structures built by the human settlers on Isabelle Minor were erased by time. Virtually all trace of the original inhabitants was removed and the moon, now known Gatriaus Four-2, was ready to house a new generation of settlers. Not human, but alien. Citizens of the Compact, eager to expand onto a fresh frontier.", "The new colonists didn\u2019t sit quite easy on their new world. The past they knew, of the self-inflicted genocide of the humans, left an uneasy taste as they looked out on the bleak, sterile beauty of their home. None of them would admit to superstition, but in hushed voices, they talked about hearing voices out in the wastelands, whispers over the radio channels. Strange shapes in the distance and odd contacts on their scopes. Some even wondered if there was a curse on this world.", "They were right.", "It came one day, blotting out the sun and Gatriaus Four-2 once again became a world that had had life upon it."]}

She was standing on a platform overlooking part of Light of Judgement\u2019s disruptor lance. Just under a kilometer from the Chariot\u2019s prow, this section was an open cylinder several decks high, one of the secondary coalescence nodes. It was ringed with EM field generators, making the entire chamber looked like the ribbed gullet of some mechanical beast. Repair drones drifted through the air alongside workers as they scanned the systems, confirming their earlier work as additional repairs were being done. Part of the superstructure had been removed, allowing overloaded, damaged and destroyed components to be replaced. The work here was almost done, but scenes like this were being repeated throughout the Chariot.", "Slung below the central command core, the lance ran from the very nose of the ship all the way to the primary reactor, with taps on every secondary fusion reactor Light of Judgement had. The technology was still very much a prototype, with all the issues that accompanied such things, expected and otherwise. It was oversized and finicky in temperament and its power draw was immense. It had to be; disruptor fields dispersed incredibly quickly. The most advanced ship-based disruptor weaponry had an effective range less than a hundred thousand kilometers. The lance more than tripled that but at a cost, drawing so much energy that the functionality of other primary and secondary systems was compromised. That had been expected; the weapon had been tested at every step of its construction and fired multiple times, in war games and ship trials. Never before in actual combat and certainly not after Light of Judgement had performed an emergency deceleration.", "The damage to the ship had been widespread, but mostly minimal to moderate \u2013 \u2018putting ice on a hundred cuts\u2019 \u2013 was an engineers\u2019 saying for this kind of work. The lance was one of the few exceptions. The strain of the Chariot\u2019s maneuvers and the additional stress of actual combat had led to several complications. Multiple sections and key systems had been severely compromised. Tired of status reports and dossiers of after-action analyses, casualty lists and repair estimates, Yunl\u2019ro had wanted to see the work progressing firsthand.", "Group Leader (Engineering) Yot-om-Brel made a burbling sound of consideration as he ran calculations in his head. The Chariot\u2019s chief engineer had come to escort his superior and personally give her a briefing of ship status. She took that as a good sign. He had served aboard Light of Judgement since the vessel was half-built and he knew every system and piece of technology intimately. Yunl\u2019ro and her staff had learned to trust Yot-em-Brel\u2019s estimates and advice. He knew which limits were merely suggestions and which were deadlines. If he could afford to take the time for this, then there was little critical work left to do. Icing the cuts, as his staff might say.", "\u201cRadiation levels lowering,\u201d the Builder assured her. \u201cSecondary charging coils already safe for maintenance. Work has begun, yes. Primary sections will take longer. Decontamination continues, but at least fourteen hours before those are safe for minimal-time entry.\u201d The kilometers-long tunnel was subdivided into work stations, service tunnels, power feeds, capacitors and massive bulkheads that could close off dozens to hundreds of meters of the corridor at a time. \u201cWill be able to confirm extent of damage and diagnostics once access available. Expect lance returned to functional status within four days. Technically operational now, but additional firings will compound damage.\u201d He blinked his bulging eyes and his wide mouth gaped in his species version of a smile. \u201cAlso not good for maintenance teams.\u201d When the Bastion Leader did not respond, he turned his body to look up at her.

He was both meticulous and efficient; if something could not be rushed, he made that clear. \u201cWeapon was successful, though. Victory was made. System secured, enemy have been routed. A victory.\u201d", "The Thoughtful nodded slowly. Husk was now in the hands of the Compact. The enemy\u2019s industry here was smashed and what defenders hadn\u2019t been obliterated had fled.

They used the pleas of the dead to lure her ships into the arms of that\u2026 Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s hands tightened on the railing as she watched several work crews go about their business. \u201cYes,\u201d she agreed after a moment. \u201cIt was.\u201d", "And how many more of these \u2018victories\u2019 will there be before I run out of ships?", "~", "\u201cFinal checks complete, matron,\u201d Colony Zanim reported. \u201cAll departments report blue.\u201d The Conjoiner turned their suited form towards the command dais and tipped their head. \u201cWe are ready.\u201d", "Grace nodded. She took a breath, looking across Brightest Night\u2019s command deck. Every station was manned. Tactical, Scopes, Operations, Helm, Navigation, Communications, Engineering, Security, each with a member of her senior staff, secondary positions held by junior officers or noncoms. Half a dozen different species were represented: Conjoiner, Didacts, Steersmen, Shimmers, Broken\u2026 and a Brute.", "Allyria was here, wearing her prosthetic visor. Every few seconds, one or more of her tintas twitched or flicked in discomfort, but she didn\u2019t show any other trace of the pain radiating through her head. She stood just behind and to the left of Grace, her hands resting the on the railing that separated the upper level of the command deck from the back wall and walkway. She wasn\u2019t operating any station, but she didn\u2019t want to miss this moment. It wasn\u2019t the first time Grace had commanded a ship \u2013 she\u2019d done that on Pale Liberation, but the other corvette had had a crew of four. Brightest Night had a complement of hundreds. This was her first time as a leader \u2013 as a captain. She was still being evaluated though, as Jendakson\u2019s presence attested. The Geontal was standing behind and to the right of command chair, next to one of the currently-unused auxiliary stations.", "She didn\u2019t want to screw up. \u201cCommunications,\u201d Grace said. Her voice was steady. \u201cContact docking control and request final clearance to depart.\u201d", "A moment passed. \u201cDocking confirms. We are free to disengage supports.\u201d", "Grace turned in her command chair. \u201cOperations.\u201d Officially, a host station or ship had full control over its docking systems. Unofficially, on the Grasp certain \u2018trusted\u2019 organizations had de facto control\u2026 and \u2018trusted\u2019 was defined as powerful or wealthy enough to be done favours, and/or pay the necessary bribes. Each of the Five were both of those. Grasp Operations could override Brightest Night\u2019s orders and lock the massive clamps and girders holding the corvette to keep it from moving, but such instances were usually emergency situations. Sometimes, Grasp Control would \u2018forget\u2019 to let a ship be released and after making appropriate and insincere apologies, let them go on their way. In more infrequent instances, the Grasp had a vested interest in keeping a ship in dock, usually because they were paid to do so, or they had \u2018suspicion of criminal activity\u2019 and needed to search the vessel... most often because they needed to prove they still did their jobs.", "Naturally, the ships most often seized either belonged to individuals and organizations too minor to matter or those who\u2019d annoyed the Grasp\u2019s people or their own masters in some way. Whenever a ship from the Five, a powerful corporation or cartel was under suspicion or selected for a \u2018random\u2019 search, they were given advance notice so that anything too incriminating could be removed, or appropriate scapegoats set up.", "There was no trouble today and Grace felt her heartbeat slow a little as her officer gave a gesture of confirmation. After the incident with Allyria, she\u2019d half-expected the Grasp to flex their muscles here, but docking control either didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t care. Either suited her. \u201cDisengage restraints,\u201d she ordered", "A slight rumble shivered through the vessel\u2019s hull. \u201cDocking clamps released,\u201d Operations reported. \u201cGantries withdrawn.\u201d A few seconds passed as the network of airlocks, walkways and braces pulled away from the corvette. \u201cWe are floating free, matron.\u201d Outside the ship, alert klaxons droned, warning lights flashing.", "\u201cProw thrusters to internal safe,\u201d Grace ordered. \u201cBack us out nice and easy.\u201d", "\u201cInternal safe,\u201d Helm acknowledged.

Blue from above.\u201d Grasp Operations didn\u2019t interfere there, either. The corvette backed into the massive airlock.

Grace enjoyed the vista for a moment before she nodded. \u201cTake us out.\u201d Brightest Night, whole once more, cleared the station. Its hull was a pale white, given dark red and black banding and chevrons that broke up its outline, a wet-navy tradition that many captains and fleets still partook in, either for aesthetic reasons or luck. On its nose was the vessel\u2019s own symbol, a gleaming moon whose light burned away the darkness around it.", "\u201cWe are free in the void,\u201d Navigation confirmed. Grace nodded.

Not right now, at least.", "\u201cHelm,\u201d she said instead, keeping her voice even. \u201cPlot a course to our first waypoint. We\u2019ve got a ship to break in.\u201d", "~", "\u201cDo you think it was worth it?\u201d", "Vinsea had come to find Nasham, introducing herself with that question. \u201cYou will,\u201d he said, \u201chave to be more specific.\u201d", "She rolled all four eyes so much he could see the whites of her sclera in each one. \u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d she told him. \u201cThis mission. Our operation in Husk.\u201d", "Nasham didn\u2019t answer the question immediately. He was in one of the exercise facilities, working a sweat up on a treadmill. His scalp was soaked with perspiration, droplets running under his shirt, down his chest and back. Tribunes were a hardy species, not a particularly fast one. That was not the same thing as \u2018slow\u2019, though; in both reaction time and physical speed, they did well enough, though they were outside the upper end of those particular metrics. Serpents were among the fastest: above them were the machines. Her machines. No living being could ever be as fast as they were\u2026 but they could still try.", "Despite the ache in his legs, Nasham tried to add a little more speed.", "The execution force was completing the scouring of this system. No further enemy vessels had been encountered, but there were still operational mines and attack drones. There\u2019d been no further starships killed, but several pinnaces and shuttles had been lost to the automatons. Rescue efforts, reclamation of damaged vessels and salvage operations had all been ongoing. Little of the machines\u2019 technology had been recovered \u2013 at least nothing from vessels like the Splinter, the recently-named Slash-class stealth destroyers and the Skinweaver monstrosity. Almost everything that had been recovered came from the wreckage of the modified civilian vessels. Those told little that the task force hadn\u2019t already known; through one method or another, their enemy acquired hulls to use as drones and upgraded them using captured Compact or Principality technology... sometimes even pieces of herself, but that was rare. Dutiful Burden, the suicide that had destroyed Invida Orbital and left the planet open to her armies, was the most recent confirmed case. In the past, these had been relegated to specific missions \u2013 more bait, or the teeth of a closing mouth. Always expendable; never part of a true navy. It had never built others of its kind.", "That conceit had been thrown on its back. The vessels in Husk had been functioning as an ad hoc defence force, bolstered by the unclassifieds. That had captured the strategists\u2019 attention and they poured over combat records and augur readings, trying to suss out every implication and detail that they could from emissions patterns, engine signatures and ship maneuvers. Every day brought more questions and fewer answers. Where had these ships been built? Why had they not been seen before? Were they responsible for the Black Veil\u2019s reputation? Where was the Scar? Were there more of these ships? When did their target start building? Too many questions.", "Though it had been noted and remarked upon, Nasham believed that the intelligence divisions had overlooked the significance of one point of data. He could scarcely blame them; the disappearance of the unknown titan-grade vessel over Husk Seven, the Skinweaver\u2019s mere existence, the coordination of the defence forces and the many unpleasant possibilities raised by their presence were the most imperative considerations. But there was still that one niggling thought\u2026", "Analysis of the hull fragments and recovered chasses from the automations indicated that nearly half had been produced around the same time that Wake of Futures had been acquired. It was impossible to get an exact date, even from such-recently constructed devices, but it reinforced the prevailing hypothesis. Coupled with the revelation that most of the weapons deployed against the execution force had used materials from this system, it \u201chighly corroborated\u201d (no one was willing to say \u2018proved\u2019, especially not this early into things) how rapidly Husk had mobilized once Gravestone realized that they had been compromised. It also underpinned the danger of giving the machines more time than absolutely necessary to prepare. One system with only a few weeks\u2019 warning and a single factory was able to cost them this much. The data lined up.", "Nasham believed differently; it was his opinion that that information supported the theory that Wake of Futures had been intended to lure them into that system, that it had all been a trap. The factory base had probably begun production before Wake of Futures ever launched. All of this was, as he had mentioned to the Bastion Leader, pottery warriors. \u201cWhat,\u201d he\u2019d been asked, \u201cdo you then make of \u2018flesh is weak\u2019?\u201d", "\u201cNothing,\u201d had been his answer. It meant nothing. She didn\u2019t think that way, but she knew they thought she thought that way.", "Neither of their quarries were anywhere to be seen, so that meant at least one of the machines facing them had had enough intelligence to not only create a trap, but enough sadistic creativity to bait it in the manner it had. That suggestion had gained little ground. It had to mean something. It means, he thought, we are still being played with.", "They had been handed a costly victory with Wake of Futures, just so they would be drawn into Husk. With the Skinweaver, the machines had even come close to destroying the armada\u2019s heaviest units. Nothing could be trusted now. Even something they had struggled to acquire had been false information \u2013 nothing more than shadows on a cave wall. The other strategists weren\u2019t stupid or arrogant, but they didn\u2019t know her like he did. Nasham had felt it was his duty to remind his peers and superiors of that. He had, perhaps argued too strenuously and it had been recommended that he take some time away from his duties.", "Vinsea\u2019s presence wasn\u2019t unexpected, though he was glad of it. He had been tending towards obsession on this journey; he was at least self-aware enough to recognize that. Without her, he suspected he would not have pulled himself out of that mental quagmire so easily\u2026 if at all. He might still be in his quarters, tittering over personnel dossiers and looking for trace connections between the bitch-machine and its human pets.", "He was glad he wasn\u2019t.", "\u201cYes,\u201d he answered at last. \u201cIt was worth it.\u201d", "\u201cForty-four ships lost,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cFor a handful of abandoned star systems and one barely defended. We bled for a hollow gourd.\u201d", "Nasham\u2019s ears twitched slightly in the negative. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe bled to prevent that gourd from being filled.\u201d", "Vinsea blinked both pairs of eyes in sequence, but before she could ask, Nasham continued. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen this system. This isn\u2019t the Wound\u2019s womb. It was a deadline. One system that she only just started fortifying.\u201d He took a few moments to catch his breath again. \u201cThe execution force has lost twenty-nine vessels,\u201d he said once he had. \u201cKemk\u2019s outriders have suffered fifteen. How many more if she had been given several more months to dig in? Or years? We\u2019ve blunted her advance, denied her vessels and industry. It cost us, but for a reason.\u201d", "\u201cForty-four ships,\u201d Vinsea said. \u201cAnd the enemy have lost scarcely half that.\u201d", "Nasham\u2019s ears twitched again. \u201cShe has killed armadas by herself,\u201d he reminded Vinsea. This visit wasn\u2019t about him, he realized. It was about her. Vinsea had studied the Wound\u2019s actions, read the reports, listened to survivor testimonies, watched battle logs. She knew how much the human Chariot outstripped the Compact technologically. But knowing that and seeing it directly, watching a mere handful of vessels inflict such losses on one of the mightiest assemblages of firepower in the Compact were very different things. The revelation of the monstrous Skinweaver abomination had sent ripples throughout the fleet. It had been destroyed, but even here on the execution force\u2019s sigil, there were rumours of what else was lying in wait for them. Nasham knew that feeling. He\u2019d felt it on Invida. \u201cWhy should her children not carry butcher\u2019s knives of their own?\u201d", "\u201cYou still call it she,\u201d Vinsea observed. \u201cHow can you still call it that? As if it were it a person?\u201d", "\u201cAfter all I have been through,\u201d Nasham said. \u201cHow can I not?\u201d He suspected a sardonic reminder that the Triarchs themselves had no gender and were most definitely persons would not be well-received. Besides, it would be feigning ignorance simply to get a rise out of the woman; in Compact Standard, kaasa referred to an individual with no gender. An object was called casah. One carried with it the connotation of personhood; the other did not. No mere thing could ever hold the depth and breadth of hate that the human machine did.", "With that question hanging in the air, Vinsea changed the subject, running a hand through her auburn mane. \u201cYou said it had all been a trap, from the instant we detected Wake of Futures.\u201d She blew a breath out through her nostrils. \u201cHow do you know? There\u2019s as much evidence for as against.\u201d", "\u201cBecause I know her,\u201d was Nasham\u2019s response. He added a couple dozen more meters to his run before he spoke again. \u201cBecause it is exactly what our enemy has done for two thousand years. The Circles of Vanmet. The infection of Furos. Execution Force Axem. A hundred times we\u2019ve believed we\u2019ve outwitted it and a hundred times it has made that belief a lie.\u201d", "\u201cYou still advocated that we follow the data we had.\u201d", "\u201cYes, of course.\u201d", "\u201cEven if it was a trap, and we lost nearly two dozen ships for it?\u201d", "\u201cYes. That system was barely defended, Vinsea. A handful of ships. A single point of industry. In a matter of weeks it built itself thousands of munitions. What if this mission were launched five months from now? A year? Seven years? What would Husk have been then? Every second that passes, she is rebuilding and rearming. Forty-four ships just to reach and hold one hollow gourd?\u201d He stopped the treadmill, breathing heavily. \u201cA bargain, if it belonged to the Wound. She has to die, Vinsea. She has to die.\u201d The fervour in his words surprised even him. \u201cSpring a thousand traps and lose ten thousand ships, but grind her, her sister and her abominate offspring into dust.\u201d", "Vinsea handed him the towel he\u2019d put on a nearby bench. Nasham patted the perspiration off his muzzle and face. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said with a grin he didn\u2019t quite feel. \u201cI hope the cost isn\u2019t that high. This has to end, though.\u201d Then, quieter: \u201cWe\u2019ve added too many names already.\u201d", "The woman reached out, putting her hand on Nasham\u2019s shoulder. He looked up and their gazes met. \u201cIt will end,\u201d she promised. \u201cWe\u2019ve tracked it back to its lair. It has nowhere to run.\u201d Then, her expression lightened. \u201cGet cleaned up,\u201d she told Nasham. \u201cThere\u2019s a service in Lounge 16 tonight. I think we should attend.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s Isktar traditional,\u201d Nasham pointed out. He wasn\u2019t Isktar, and neither was Vinsea. The Isktar culture stretched back thousands of years on pre-spaceflight Oada and even today, many of their customs persisted. One of them was that a funeral was not for mourning death, but for celebrating life. They were not somber affairs, but boisterous and loud, with music and dancing for the attendees. It had started as a way to show the spirits of the dead that their loved ones honoured their lives and would not lose themselves in grief. Individuals from cultures with more somber traditions often saw these funerals as irreverent, even insulting to the deceased. Nasham didn\u2019t share the latter opinion, but he wasn\u2019t in the mood for a large social gathering.", "\u201cI know,\u201d Vinsea said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going. I think both of us could us a distraction and an Isktar funeral is just the thing. Besides,\u201d she said with a smile on her lips and a gleam in all four eyes, \u201cyou\u2019ll get to see me out of uniform.\u201d", "Nasham watched her depart, towelling off the sweat running down his neck. He blinked slowly, then a small grin curled his lips back from his teeth. \u201cI suppose,\u201d he said to the empty room. \u201cI am going to get cleaned up.\u201d", "~", "Brightest Night wasn\u2019t a dreadnought by any stretch. It was on the small side even for a corvette, just under three hundred meters and built to civilian specifications. Even with all the modifications the Red Hand had made to it, the vessel was little more than a nuisance to any capital ship and even most military-grade escorts. Still, it was fast, it was nimble, it was quick to accelerate and fast to respond and, for the moment at least, it was hers.", "Grace stood up from her command chair as the simulation came to a close. \u201cGood work,\u201d she told her bridge crew, taking a quick eye at Jendakson. The strategist tilted his head to the left in his species\u2019 version of an affirmative nod. They\u2019d been running ship and crew trials for the last eight days throughout Jan-xhai. Stealth and tracking exercises on incoming freighters, fellow Red Hand and some of the Grasp\u2019s own militia, as well as performing search operations, internal drills \u2013 boarding, disaster and evacuation \u2013 and combat and navigational tests outside safety of a hangar and onboard simulations. The young woman was pleased with how well her people were doing (and didn\u2019t that term sound odd to her \u2013 a provisional spectator who hadn\u2019t even completed her final year at the academy). She was proud of how well she was doing, though. She was trying to second-guess herself less, but she knew she wasn\u2019t always successful.", "Kelkon had been easier. Stopping the Janissary from firing at Nemesis\u2019s Scarabs had been easier. Telling Jirrico about Sundial had been easier.", "\u201cDon\u2019t overthink,\u201d Allyria had admonished Grace. \u201cJust put yourself in the same mindset as those moments.\u201d", "\u201cWhen I wasn\u2019t thinking about how I could screw it all up?\u201d", "That had earned her a remonstrating bite. \u201cYes,\u201d the Verrish had replied. \u201cExactly that. No one expects you to be another Gerrisu ne Kev or Sun Tzu. They don\u2019t want perfection. They just want to see the woman who fought in Kelkon.\u201d She\u2019d taken Grace\u2019s head in her hands. \u201cSo do I. All of her. The one who fought\u2026 and the one who remembered that she did.\u201d", "The young woman was trying to be that person. She wanted to do everything right, to prove she could. Just relax, she\u2019d had to remind herself more than once. Don\u2019t overthink. She was getting better, but she still felt like she didn\u2019t belong here. Not really.", "She felt like she belonged back aboard Nemesis. She belonged back on Rally. A free Rally. She might never see that, but if she did, it would be because she became something other than a girl frightened of her own authority, or a woman who didn\u2019t need a crisis before she stepped up.", "Grace took a breath and smoothed out creases in her uniform that weren\u2019t actually there. \u201cStrategist Jendakson \u2013 if you\u2019re ready?\u201d", "The strategist dipped his head, a ripple of colour running over skin. \u201cYes, Leader,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe I have seen enough for a preliminary evaluation.\u201d", "\u201cSubmissive Zanim,\u201d Grace said to her first officer. \u201cCommand is yours.\u201d She gestured for the Geontal to join her in her office. Before she did so, she took a quick look over her shoulder at Allyria. The Verrish didn\u2019t notice. The visor was a poor substitute for her original eyes.", "Grace turned back and followed Jendakson into her office, wondering how she\u2019d done today\u2026 and whether she\u2019d been a cadet unsure of herself, or an officer.", "~", "It was the end of the day aboard the massive citadel Armour of Contempt and Bastion Leader Kemk was still at his desk. Today had been busy; aside from the standard barrage of minor incidents, status reports, complaints, requests and briefings, four more vessels had been completed, and their slips were already being readied for the next hulls to be laid down. There had been several hiccups in the resource extraction from Vumot; power surges aboard one processing site had forced it to shut down and there had been several minor to severe disruptions in the control networks of local mining drones. The incidents were being investigated, but so far they looked like ill-timed accidents, though whether from negligence or misfortune was unknown at present. Galhemna\u2019s hunger kept its people working as hard as they could \u2013 often, harder than they should \u2013 and accidents were bound to happen... but it would be made sure that they were accidents.", "Another set of security sweeps and checks of the construction teams attending the high tier wombs had been completed. The interference in the work was unfortunate, but they had already been compromised once. Kemk was determined to have every hole patched. The increased measures had already unrooted several other infiltrators \u2013 some from the Principality, some from the Red Hand and even various acts of corporate espionage and simple criminal activity, but the damage had been done.", "There were undoubtedly enemy agents still operating in Galhemna; the system was home to hundreds of millions of civilians, government officials and military personnel. Even if the percentage of people that were suborned or false was even just one for every hundred million loyal souls, that still meant dozens of enemy agents. Until the last few weeks, he had been proud that there had been no major breaches under his watch. The revelation of the Principality spy and the reveal that one of the Argosy\u2019s newest stealth ships had been here in Galhemna was not just a blow to operational security, but to his pride as well.", "The Worker had committed suicide rather than be captured, but much of the information he\u2019d collected had been recovered. The Jackals would know Galhemna was building Chariots. That was unfortunate, but Compact intelligence had been busy as well; Kemk knew what his counterpart across the border had access to. Not enough, was the short of it. If Jirrico tried to build up his forces faster than he already was, it would be noticed. Every day Galhemna laid down new hulls and completed others. Every day, its defences grew stronger. By the time the Principality could bring sufficient forces to bear on the Veiled Reaches, Sundial would be ready to launch. More than a thousand ships and three Chariots driving their way into the Principality, heralding the beginning of the end for that nation. It would neither be swift nor easy, but it would be inevitable. Even if the Jackals recognized the threat, it was too late.", "Still, Kemk would not leave the future of Sundial and the Compact\u2019s blow to the Principality\u2019s vitals to presumption, no matter how confident it might be. Aside from the reviews and initiatives taking place in Galhemna, he had passed directives for other high-value systems to re-evaluate their own security protocols. The Bastion Leader had further ordered an increase in cross-border strikes and commerce raids to put more pressure on Kebrak Daun, keeping them off-balance and on the defensive. The Veiled Reaches were in a good position, but he didn\u2019t believe in resting on one\u2019s hindbones. Security was a proactive affair, as emphasized by the two files currently displayed on Kemk\u2019s monitor.", "The first was an update from Bastion Leader Yunl\u2019ro. There was much that the woman was leaving out, but this was the most recent of her requests for additional support units. Kemk tried not to grind his teeth. The Thoughtful was being circumspect about her losses, but of the ships he had sent with Yunl\u2019ro, fifteen had been lost. Fifteen. That was more casualties than he\u2019d taken in the year to date, and he oversaw a sector beset by terrorist attacks and Jackal incursions.", "\u2018Hostile contact\u2019, he thought darkly at Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s turn of phrase. He wasn\u2019t being kept completely in the dark, even if it was possible to do so. He knew what had killed Pradesh\u2019s ships wasn\u2019t any Red Hand vessel and he knew that Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro had just fought something inside the nebula, something that had cost his Thoughtful counterpart and himself yet more ships and souls. He didn\u2019t like the uncertainty of that situation. He didn\u2019t like not knowing there was a threat sitting on the threshold to his manor, something that had already cost him many good officers and dutiful soldiers. Something that might have been doing that long before now\u2026 and he\u2019d had no thought to look for it.", "He was pressing his intelligence divisions hard, having them review everything to do with the Black Veil. Every survey report, every missing ship, every massacred colony and every \u2018anomaly\u2019 in their records, no matter how minor it seemed. Yunl\u2019ro had also suggested that he look for \u2018connections\u2019 in the Red Hand\u2019s operations, but she had not expanded on what those connections were or to whom they might be. He believed he knew the latter, though. He had made some discrete inquiries and had come up with a name: Gravestone. The more he dug into that, the less sanguine he became, enough that he had sent a formal query to Force Command. If there was a threat in his region, he must know of it.", "And speaking of threats\u2026 Kemk regarded the second report on his screen. Five days ago, the newest and largest planetary spaceport on oceanic Metrika had been destroyed. The attack had been a masterstroke. Ground Force combat engineers could hardly have done better.", "One of the primary underwater braces for the massive structure had been bombed, just moments before a heavy-lift shuttle had landed. Unable to support itself, let alone more than a hundred thousand tonnes of orbital lander, the platform had collapsed, plunging the shuttle into the ocean and flooding the rest of the facility. Secondary explosives had gone off, blowing open watertight doors and support bulkheads. Aided and abetted by the facility\u2019s own less-than-perfect safety protocols and failsafes, in under an hour, over six thousand square kilometers of space port went under the waves \u2013 right alongside Joran Sur Industries\u2019 stock price, which continued to plummet as news of this calamity spread across the sector. Vn\u2019zamos had reported that at least one contract that Joran Sur had held had already been withdrawn.", "Normally, a terrorist action like this was cause for a sharp fluctuation in market share, but the ongoing collapse in JSI\u2019s stock wasn\u2019t just due to the attack, or the revelation of insufficient safety measures. No, the reason for that came in the aftermath of the bombing. The Red Hand had claimed credit for it \u2013 as if anyone else in the sector had the liver or capability \u2013 saying that, among their usual self-righteous nonsense \u2018We remember Cykadia.\u2019 That had sent investors and shareholders into a panic. Thirty years ago, JSI had been responsible for a mining disaster that took the lives of more than two thousand Kobolds. The company had tried to cover it up and when they were finally forced to come forward, some considered their apologies lacking. The executives responsible either retained their positions or were moved into other departments; it was only a variety of low-level managerial staff that bore that brunt of the company\u2019s response. Since then, JSI had been aggressive in litigation and manners towards anyone who brought up the Cykadia incident, tying up many of the dead miners\u2019 families in the courts when they contested the \u2018fairly calculated\u2019 compensation they were offered\u2026 and the non-disclosure contracts that came with that sum. Over the years, the matter had slowly faded from the public consciousness.", "Not to the Red Hand, though. As anyone with a modicum of knowledge of that organization knew, they neither forgot, nor forgave. We remember Cykadia. Those three words were a clear statement that Joran Sur had not slipped from their memory. The terrorists did not make idle boasts and as word of their intent spread, JSI found itself floundering. Another poignant example of how the littlest things, if left unattended, became much more than that.", "The situation on Metrika was bad, but it was simply another act of terrorism in a sector where such things happened far too often, despite the Compact\u2019s efforts. Some of Kemk\u2019s analysts believed this was just another flare-up in the wake of Jackson\u2019s death, but the Bastion Leader was convinced otherwise. Local police and intelligence forces had reacted quickly to the bombing, locating and raiding the cell responsible, but the vermin had already evacuated.", "That was a bright orange flag to Kemk. It was her handiwork. The bombing had been executed with near-military precision, and those responsible had vanished as skillfully as a commando unit slipping the leash. The target wasn\u2019t just another gaudy measure of corporate excesses and alleged crimes. The loss of the spaceport had set back mining operations on Metrika considerably, injured a company that the insurgents considered exploitive, referenced past sins and reminded every soul in the sector that the Red Hand let nothing pass. The attack wasn\u2019t just a strike at the Compact. Its effects had been military, economic and political.", "That kind of skillful, multifaceted terrorism was something that Kemk was all too familiar with. It was the Red Queen\u2019s trademark. The sacracaa Broken was here in his sector\u2026 or if not her, than one of her direct, never-sufficiently-damned subordinates. There was no evidence for that assumption, though. He knew, though. From the base of his liver, he knew. But. He could be jumping at shadows. There was a single datapoint, which could be an \u2018ordinary\u2019 terrorist action, or another move in the suspected power struggle as one contender proved themselves bolder and more capable than their confederates. The Tribune wished they\u2019d settle such disputes as most every other Unbound did, by killing each other. That was too much to hope for, though. The Red Hand might be a pack of mercenaries, pirates, terrorists and Unbound filth, but they had greater discipline than even some corporate and paramilitary navies. If they didn\u2019t, they would have long since broken. But the piss-drinking murderers were damnably resolute.", "Kemk scowled at that thought, the expression deepening as he looked back at the report from Yunl\u2019ro. The Principality threatened, the Red Hand threatened and now this \u2018Gravestone\u2019 threatened. The Veiled Reaches and Galhemna were crucial to the Compact. He couldn\u2019t allow anything to interfere with that. He had done his best to ensure the security of this system and sector\u2026 but now, he was starting to wonder if his best was going to be good enough.", "The Bastion Leader blew out a sigh through his mouth. He turned off the computer and lifted himself out of his chair. He had done all he could today.", "Tomorrow he would do it all over again, and then the day after and the day after that, until his duty was complete. He could only hope that he would not let anything more into the walls of this manor. Not too much longer, Kemk thought as the door locked behind him. A few more months. Perhaps a year. Then, there truly will be nothing anyone can do.", "~", "Intersection: Shadow Hunt", "Ship Lady Shines As Dawn undulated through the corridors of her command, the Askanj Principality Argosy Vessel Shadow Hunt. As she slithered along, the snake-like Askanj-illth could feel the different textures of the deck underneath her. Her people made up the greatest portion of the Principality\u2019s military. Consequently, the Argosy\u2019s ships were designed with the serpentine species in mind. They had ramps instead of stairs and memory metal that shifted from ladder to pole to allow different species to move between levels easily. Even the deck plating had been adjusted, varying from smooth to rough to allow Askanj-illth to easily slither along it.", "Shadow Hunt was new. It had the smell and feel of a vessel fresh from the yards \u2013 which it was. It didn\u2019t even have a name. Its designation was an alphanumeric string, and \u2018Shadow Hunt\u2019 was a nickname Ship Mistress Bright Moon Eyes had given the vessel. It was a good name. It was almost enough to make Shines As Dawn forgive her first officer for the nickname she\u2019d gotten during her first year at the academy: \u2018Coils Around Legs\u2019. Shines As Dawn had an\u2026 interest in bipedal males. During her officer training, she\u2019d had relations with a fellow cadet, an Askanj-anj who was equally curious about the females of her species. She hadn\u2019t known how fragile he was, and he hadn\u2019t known how tightly Askanj-illth wound around their partners when they were in a mating grasp. She\u2019d inadvertently broken his pelvis, fractured several of his ribs and his legs. He\u2019d had to spend several weeks undergoing regenerative treatments and physical therapy.", "Word of the incident had gotten around campus and Bright Moon Eyes had given her friend her new nickname. In nearly a decade, that name had stayed with her. One day Shines As Dawn would forgive Bright Moon Eyes\u2026 probably when that appellation stopped being true. She\u2019d been with her current consort, Ship Lord Fainev of House Locan-thra of the Bladebreaker for several years. He\u2019d gotten over being hospitalized, but he still occasionally made fun of her for it.  ", "They hadn\u2019t seen each other for six months, since Shines As Dawn had begun this assignment. The vessel was a strike cruiser, one of the newest and latest to roll out of the yards at Sevesh Daun. It might even be the most advanced piece of hardware in the entire Principality.", "And she\u2019s all mine, Shines As Dawn thought giddily. She knew she was young for such a responsibility; less than a year into her promotion to Ship Lady and with less than a decade\u2019s total service to the Argosy. She knew she had acquitted herself well at Braden Taur and liked to think her actions that day had caught the eye of the Argosy\u2019s nobility, but the realist in her knew that it was only partially Braden Taur\u2026 the rest was how badly the Argosy was hurting for officers and crew.", "The war against the Compact of Species was not going well, not since the Triarchs had declared another \u2018age of expansion\u2019 and set their hounds loose upon the Principality. In truth, the war never really stopped. It would go cold for decades and centuries, for so long that such things passed out of living memory\u2026 only for the Compact to once again attempt to glut itself on every star within its sight and for those many years of relative peace turn to relentless, grinding war.", "This time, the Space Force was pushing the Argosy hard, forcing them back almost without cease. Hundreds of systems had been lost in battle or ceded in tactical withdrawals as mauled, decimated Argosy fleets ran from the foe, hoping to catch their breath before the next assault. The media and government tried to warm the news, but the truth was that the Principality was losing more than they ever had before and their forces were approaching brink of collapse. They weren\u2019t there yet, but it was within sight of anyone who cared to see.", "That was why an Askanj-illth maiden with scales as clean as hers had been called to command this prototype. Shines As Dawn had put the strike cruiser through its paces in trials and in open space, in war games, simulations and minor, controlled skirmishes. This would be the first true test of its capabilities, and the capabilities of all its kin. It had to be tested to its limits and the nobility had chosen a target specifically to do just that.", "Shadow Hunt had slipped through the front lines \u2013 a relatively easy trick for a single ship \u2013 but operating continuously behind the enemy walls was much riskier. Their target was a retrofitting facility, the system code-named Inkyu. Inkyu had once been on the edge of Compact territory, but as the enemy had driven deeper into the Principality, this system had become further removed from the war zone. Now, it was a waypost for starships preparing to cross into contested space, and a place to repair and re-arm those forced back due to damage or depletion. It wasn\u2019t a keystone of the Compact\u2019s operations, but its loss would hurt. It would mean those ships had to stage from farther away, had to travel farther to make good their damage, keeping them out of battle for longer.", "Shines As Dawn and her crew were to take the Inkyu facility out. Preferably destroy it, hopefully cripple it. The Ship Lady had been a free hand in how she went about it, but Shadow Hunt would be alone. No other vessels could be spared. If Shadow Hunt couldn\u2019t do so on its own, it needed to retreat and report that information. Shines As Dawn hated the thought of having to return without success, but for all her excitement at this command and her eagerness to unleash it, she couldn\u2019t risk it or her crew pointlessly. If this vessel was incapable of penetrating the Compact\u2019s defences, that information was absolutely essential for the design teams, engineers and shipwrights to know.", "Shadow Hunt couldn\u2019t enter the enemy system without being noticed. The enemy weren\u2019t idiots; a transition point with an unresponsive vessel that went into stealth operations would signal a hostile incursion and put them on edge. The strike cruiser would never get close to the facility that way. Other traditional methods would also meet with failure, but she\u2019d come up with a plan, one that relied on the new technologies and improvements she had at her disposal. It was extremely risky, and it pushed the capabilities of her crew and their prototype systems to their limits, but it was a good chance.", "The cruiser had spent months scoping out the spaceways around Inkyu, searching out convoys and civilian traffic while deliberately avoiding contact with enemy vessels. Their target wasn\u2019t an island unto itself. It needed supply and support of its own. With painstaking work, Shadow Hunt had discovered many of the routes that the vessels servicing Inkyu used, their ports of call, the in-system locations where they would emerge for realspace position checks during their travel. At first, her crew believed that their Lady intended to begin commerce raiding, but she left each and every shipment alone. It galled her to let so many fat sows wander by, but if Inkyu couldn\u2019t think it was a target. Not more than it already was. Any increased security measures would ruin her plan, so she had to let those ships go and let her enemy grow stronger with each one that slipped past her silent guns.", "Finally, after those months of nerve-wracking stalking and reconnaissance, it was time. Shadow Hunt waited in silent patience at the edge of a worthless, burned-out star system. They\u2019d been here for weeks, running on minimal power. The crew was nervous, restless and starting to wonder if their young Ship Lady was perhaps too young. Even Shines As Dawn had thought she might have guessed wrong, but then: vindication. A small scout appeared, spooled its engines back up and then transited back out-system.", "Of all the convoys, companies and supply ships that tended to Inkyu\u2019s needs, Shines As Dawn had spotted an opportunity in this one. Its commander was clever. This convoy had eight different routes that they used in their travel from their launch point to Inkyu. After they ran through each travel route, the courses were reordered randomly and the convoy ran through them again. A military officer led that force; most civilians tended to use the same transit passages over and over, or cycle through a bare handful. Few companies or traders would undercut their profit margins by using so many non-optimal travel routes. It also meant that either the convoy\u2019s commander was professionally paranoid \u2013 a fair assumption, given the number of commerce raids and Renegades that liked to pick at each nation\u2019s bones while their navies were occupied \u2013 or the convoy was high-value. Shines As Dawn suspected that it was the latter, so she\u2019d attempted to out-guess her opponent and predict their next move.", "The convoy leader didn\u2019t just shift around her travel routes \u2013 she had a scout that she used to lead the convoy, sending it to each destination ahead of the transports. If it reported anything suspect, the convoy switched to an alternate route. This time, it saw nothing but open space and headed back to report that.", "Less than a day later, more than thirty huge transports and their escorts transited into the system. Their course was a shallow parabola that dipped across the transition layer and eventually led back out. While their transit systems were spooling back up, they were vulnerable to ambush; pulling deeper in-system gave them a modicum of protection from that. Once they were ready to transit, they would head back out-system. Their course would take them right to Shadow Hunt. Despite the caution in their transitions, the convoy stuck to standard behaviours once they were in-system and once again, Shines As Dawn had guessed right, positioning Shadow Hunt close to the end of the parabola. As the convoy trudged along, the strike cruiser studied their course, refined its estimates of their final destination and carefully adjusted course to bring it there.", "It took nineteen hours for the convoy to reach the strike cruiser\u2019s position. The scout, carried through the last transit by a larger mothership, deployed and raced ahead of the freighters, its transit systems restabilized and ready before its compatriots. As they continued along, it made its own transit, leaving the freighters to continue their unaware approach to Shadow Hunt. There was little risk of a collision, but Shadow Hunt\u2019s helm crew kept a careful hand the emergency thrusters, just in case. The transports slowed their acceleration.", "Shadow Hunt sat amidst a loose formation of ships many times larger than itself and their escorts. Powered down, the strike cruiser was helpless. If it was seen, it could easily be killed \u2026", "\u2026but the Argosy had spent fortunes in the development of the stealth technology. If Shadow Hunt could be seen, they needed to know that before more money and time was wasted.", "For what seemed much longer than it truly was, Shadow Hunt lay still, its passive sensors drinking in everything they could, its smart paint and cloaking field masking it perfectly from detection. Inside the warship, the strike cruiser\u2019s waste heat slowly built up, making it pleasant for the Askanj-illth crew; less so for everyone else.", "Finally, the scout returned. The next system was safe, though that had hardly been in question. The convoy powered up its transit systems. Shines As Dawn uncoiled from her command sling. The convoy\u2019s next and final destination was Inkyu. \u201cSensors\u2026\u201d she whispered softly.", "The enemy flotilla ripped themselves out of realspace, the gravitic wash of their transition buffeting Shadow Hunt and shaking countless millions of tonnes of starship. \u201cSensors?\u201d The Ship Lady asked. The question nearly caught in her lungs. Askanj-illth didn\u2019t use the concept of \u2018hurdles\u2019 in their metaphors like legged species did, but she knew this was another one. Snatching possible transit data from outgoing ships was always difficult, and they needed more than just potential destinations.", "\u201cWe have it, Lady. Vector and relative transit velocity.\u201d", "\u201cRestore power,\u201d Shines As Dawn snapped hurriedly, swirling about. Alarms fluted gently throughout the vessel as Shadow Hunt switched from minimal energy levels to normal functions. Its primary reactor flared brighter, engines came online, transit systems readied themselves. At Shines As Dawn\u2019s word, the strike cruiser hurled itself into netherspace, racing to catch up to the convoy. This would be the most dangerous part of the mission. Neither Shadow Hunt nor convoy would truly be able to see each other in transit. The strike cruiser was using its sensor data and the best guesses of its crew and computers to blindly intercept the Compact ships. Vessels leaving at the same time, using the same telemetry could synchronize their transitions.", "This was different. Even the few minutes it had taken Shadow Hunt to stir itself out of wintersleep introduced variables into the transition calculations. \u201cCompute the necessary course and transit speed curves. I want perfect.\u201d Anything less than that would mean a mission failure and most likely their deaths, but there would be no way to know if that until they arrived. If they lived.", "Hours passed. Shines As Dawn slept fitfully, curled up in the hollow of her circled mattress, hoping that her gamble would pay off. She knew what she was doing was risky, but she\u2019d spent months trying to find a way for Shadow Hunt to get into Inkyu and this was the only way that had any chance of success. Mimicking a friendly ship wouldn\u2019t get them past the outer perimeter. The other convoys weren\u2019t valuable enough to get as deep in-system as they needed. They couldn\u2019t run silent and coast their way in. One ship couldn\u2019t do this on its own.", "Unless it was Shadow Hunt.", "She was awake and ready when Shadow Hunt reached its destination. The strike cruiser tore its way back into realspace, blind and even more vulnerable than it had been when lying amidst the convoy. Missiles could be scorching towards them even now, railfire and energy beams about to strike the vessel and the only warning they would have is when they began to come apart.", "None of that happened, though. Shadow Hunt\u2019s systems stabilized, her sensors came back up\u2026 and Shines As Dawn felt her crests, splayed and taut, sag and fold against her head in relief. She shared a look with Bright Moon Eyes and her first officer tipped her head in respect to her Ship Lady\u2019s success. They were again in the midst of the convoy, having matched their transit speed perfectly. Well, they had drifted nearly a half a million kilometers from their previous relative position, but that was still amazingly accurate. No other vessel could have done the same. They would have undershot or overrun their quarry, come out so far from the convoy that they wouldn\u2019t appear to be one of them \u2013 any one of a hundred thousand other things, but Shadow Hunt had done it.", "\u201cBe sure to note the accuracy of our transition,\u201d Shines As Dawn commented as Shadow Hunt sidled back into the midst of the convoy. It would have been lost in the mass emergence, but the longer it was unshrouded, the more likely it would be spotted. Its chance still lay in the freighters it had followed to this system. They were still blind, still completely unaware of the huntress in their herd. \u201cI\u2019m sure the development team will be very pleased to see how well these new tracking programs and algorithms worked.\u201d", "\u201cStealth systems restored,\u201d Operations reported.", "\u201cEngage shroud. Maintain maximum stealth operations. Put us into the wake of the tailing freighter.\u201d That would help hide them. The freighters had civilian-grade sensors, but once Shadow Hunt began moving, it would be easier to detect. Concealing its drive wake in that of one of the last ships in the convoy would let them pass unnoticed. The lesson of Yulzhak Daun, Shines As Dawn thought sardonically.", "Several minutes passed. The convoy\u2019s systems stabilized, their drives coming on-line, and their sensors were no longer blinded by the transition backwash, but they and their escorts remained completely unaware of Shadow Hunt. The small fleet set course for the first of the system\u2019s checkpoints. Eventually they would reach the inner system and the slowly-growing repair facility that Shadow Hunt was here to destroy.", "\u201cCalm and steady,\u201d Shines As Dawn said. \u201cKeep us right behind her skirts, Helm. We still have a long way to go.\u201d", "She looked at the display tank, and the marker of the Inkyu docks upon it. This wasn\u2019t a killing blow by any means. But it would slow the Compact. It would prove how effective the Argosy\u2019s new technology could be and most of all, it would buy them time. Time for more Shadow Hunts to be built. Time for more Inkyus to be destroyed.", "Yes, the Askanj-illth thought. A very long way. But we\u2019re getting closer."]}

Though his offices were deep inside the pallisade Temigen\u2019s Regret, the chamber was filled with warm natural light from the windows that encircled the large, two-level chamber. Through them, a sun older and a deeper yellow than that at the center of Kebrak Daun shone down from a cloudless sky. Jirrico had the window displays set to mimic the conditions of his birth city, hundreds of light-years away. He had no idea if the sun was actually out over his distant home; for all he knew, it could have been grey and hailing. The program generated weather based on meteorological records and a built-in randomizer. He liked the reminder of his home, one of the many things he fought for. It made the more unpalatable parts of his job easier to live with, especially now when the Principality\u2019s oldest worlds either were now, or would soon be, under threat.", "Since he had sent that message to Argosy Nobility, he needed that reminder more than ever. Jirrico braced his hands on his desk and straightened as his aide stood in front of him, her crests partially engorged in anxiety. \u201cYes, Ichcit?\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019ve arrived,\u201d she told him. There wasn\u2019t any need to say who they were. There was only one arrival of any note today. \u201cThey\u2019ll be docking momentarily.\u201d", "Jirrico set down his datapad, pushing it to one side. He placed both double-thumbed hands on the top of his desk. \u201cThey\u2019re early,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must have been pushing their sublights hard.\u201d", "\u201cYes, Lord. I informed you as soon as Station Control alerted me.\u201d", "The flag officer tilted his head in acknowledgment, though he didn\u2019t look at his aide as he tapped into the station\u2019s sensor and traffic feed, looking for one signal in particular. It was an Argosy Will of Winds-class courier, the fastest transit-capable ship in the Principality, possibly the entire galaxy. That speed had a price, though: their transition systems burned out after only one or two uses, unlike the handful of transitions that most couriers could perform before ruining their miniaturized (and very expensive) FTL systems. The courier had arrived in Kebrak Daun less than two days ago. After identifying itself, it began accelerating in-system to Temigen\u2019s Regret, Jirrico\u2019s base of naval operations for Kebrak Segment. Even encrypted, the message the courier carried was too sensitive to be transmitted \u2013 not even the risk of a laser link was acceptable.", "\u201cI see. Thank you.\u201d Jirrico let out a long breath. He might not know the content of this message, but he knew what matter it concerned. That the Principality, a nation three thousand years old, made up of dozens of species and thousands of worlds, should find its survival balanced on the edge of a knife like this\u2026 fate had cruel ironies. It had been just over three and a half months since he had sent his message and his recommendations to Argosy Nobility. The decision had been made much faster than he had thought it would be.", "As he\u2019d waited, he\u2019d kept occupied. The last three months had seen an increase in Compact raids, enemy lancers striking at Kebrak segment and the bordering regions. Losses amongst the outlying systems were low, but rising. Jirrico had to divert more of his vessels to patrol and interception duties, weakening his core systems\u2019 defence forces. He had sent requests for reinforcements, but there were many Noble Lords with more immediate needs. That had changed with the looming threat of Sundial; Argosy Nobility had promised support, but whatever they could send would either be too little to matter, or arrive too late to do any good.", "He\u2019d been organizing a counter-offensive, hoping several lancers of his own would force Kemk to look to his own systems and draw down the incursions, but the results from that plan had yet to ripen. There\u2019d also been initiatives to bolster the segment\u2019s militia forces; they wouldn\u2019t hold up to a dedicated assault, but they could slow them down and deter lighter raids. He was making the best use out of what he had, but there had never been a need for a heavy Argosy presence here. Kebrak was too far from the front lines, and the Compact was tied down fighting an insurgency. That, Jirrico had realized, was exactly what the Principality was supposed to think.", "Jirrico hadn\u2019t expected a response to the Broken\u2019s proposal so soon; either his superiors had decided to leap on the opportunity as soon as they could, or they had rejected it almost out of hand. The scales of fate, Jirrico mused. In one pan was the Compact\u2019s unceasing pressure and the Argosy\u2019s need to slow that grinding tide long enough to roll out their new technologies. Sundial was yet another weight tossed onto that side of the scale. Balanced against the erosion of the Principality\u2019s hopes was Chrysalis and the Rains of Oshanta. A computer designed to do nothing more than serve its people\u2026 and a neverborn that had killed countless millions in two millennia of unrelenting war. A neverborn that might be able to turn the tide of battle. The Principality would be giving it the means to do so, but in doing so they would become Ascaen from the legend, sharpening the genhali\u2019s claws. In some stories, the genhali had rewarded Ashaken. In others, she had used those talons on him.", "Of late, the Askanj-anj\u2019s thoughts had been turning more to the myths and legends he\u2019d heard as a child. The Drowned, Ascaen and the genhali were just two parables of many that encapsulated the same lesson. How often we sow the seeds of our own destruction.", "And we come once again to fate\u2019s dagger, he thought. Chrysalis. The Principality\u2019s name for the last remnant of a dead empire. It had stalked the Diamond Path for twenty centuries, leaving broken ships, molten wreckage\u2026 and shattered worlds, the Askanj-anj thought as he remembered the Betrosha Nebula incident. The Principality had only ever tacitly supported Chrysalis\u2019s actions \u2013 looking the other way from its occasional predations, or allowing it to recuperate briefly within their territory. They had never rendered direct aid to it. Anyone who thought there could be a permanent alliance between the Principality and a neverborn was na\u00efve. Chrysalis was an intelligence made for war. Its rampancy would not be confined to the Compact forever. Sooner or later, it would be become a threat to all life.", "But now\u2026 now it might be the Principality\u2019s last thin reed in rising waters. \u201cHow did it come to this?\u201d Jirrico asked aloud.", "\u201cFleet Lord?\u201d Ichit queried.", "\u201cNothing,\u201d Jirrico said. \u201cNothing.

Sie was one of the few officers in Kebrak Daun cleared to know about \u2018Project Hatchling\u2019. It was hir work and agents that had managed to get their asset into Galhemna\u2019s Tier Seven yards. Now, Jirrico would be calling on hir again. Whatever his peers and superiors within the Argosy\u2019s nobility had decided, it was vital to get word to the Red Hand and Chrysalis\u2019s \u2018associates\u2019 as quickly as possible.", "Ichcit tilted her head in acknowledgment, taking her leave as rapidly as decorum allowed, already speaking into her comm as the doors to her uncle\u2019s office closed behind her.", "Jirrico lowered himself further into his chair. On a whim, he brought up progress reports and system traffic feeds. He had hundreds of ships here and throughout the segment, with hundreds more under construction and the yards themselves were being expanded as quickly as possible. It wasn\u2019t enough. Galhemna had already had the lead on Kebrak Daun and the Compact was pouring industry and wealth into that system. Its yards were larger and more numerous and it was building ships faster than he was. Under his command, the productivity of Kebrak had increased more than twenty percent, and segment losses from Renegades and lancers had dropped substantially. He had enough firepower in this segment \u2013 in this system \u2013 to shatter entire nations. The Argosy in its entirety had countless thousands of vessels to call upon. It should have been easy to spare enough ships\u2026 Unless you were facing an opponent as numerous as you and just as deadly. An enemy that was even now glutting itself on star system after star system, moving ever-deeper into the body of his nation.", "The Principality had the second-largest war engine the Diamond Path had ever seen\u2026 but what they could do with it was not enough.", "To defeat Sundial, they would need something else, something the Compact could not predict nor hope to counter. Something that left ruin in its wake, the ashes of fleet and the carcasses of worlds. They would need Chrysalis. The Askanj-anj felt a sudden ache in his crests. Nearly a year ago, a neverborn\u2019s thrall had sat before him and told him how his nation would die. He\u2019d hoped to prove her wrong, but the data from Galhemna was damning. Sundial was coming. He\u2019d done all he could. He\u2019d forwarded everything to his superiors, including his recommendation that they take this deal, and offer the machine a fleet\u2019s worth of tribute, and hope that they were not giving it weapons to use against them.", "In the halls of power so far from here, the decision had been made. The answer was on its way to his office.", "Jirrico didn\u2019t know what it would be. The weights on either side of the scales were heavy; the slow, corrosive destruction of the Compact, against the risk of unleashing something worse upon the galaxy. Neither outcome was what he wanted. Neither answer would offer him any relief, but fate was inexorable. He hoped that this was not where his nation\u2019s destiny was decided, but deep inside, he was afraid that it would be.", "~", "Allyria sat on the edge of the pond, dangling her toes in the water. She was back on the Grasp, in the Hot Gardens. All around her, she could smell the verdant flora that filled the humid greenhouse and the throbbing in her head was slowly receding. Here, there wasn\u2019t as much noise as in the rest of the station. The wash of sensation from so many people and devices was muted, a distant, soft murmur. The young woman tilted her face up towards the high arched ceiling of the room, but she didn\u2019t see any of the greenery, nor the domed roof with its bright, warm lights that shone down on the garden. Her visor sat on the mossy overhang next to her. She had to restrain the urge to hurl it into the pond. It was water-resistant anyways. She\u2019d just have to slosh blindly around for it, or ask for help to retrieve it, which would be humiliating. She hated it. She hated the reminder of how stupid she\u2019d been, what had happened to her\u2026 of what she\u2019d done.", "A drop of water splashed against her forehead, running down the right side of her face. The Hot Gardens were humid and large enough that the air cooled as it rose, turning to dew on the towering, genetically-modified trees, running down stems and leaves to drip onto the flagstone paths, grasses and visitors. The first droplet curled its way to the corner of her lip and she licked it away. Another ran down to her left ear, dangling there for a second before falling.", "She flicked her toes in the water. Like humans, Verrisha had five digits, but they were longer and wider-spaced. In place of a \u2018big toe\u2019, they had dewclaws. In her species\u2019 prehistory, those digits been used to help hold struggling prey as foreclaws and teeth opened bellies and throats.", "They worked just as well to pin a squirming, giggling, panting human under her.", "At those thoughts of Grace, Allyria let out a slow breath. Grace was off-station, commanding Brightest Night. Now that it was repaired, the corvette was running customs and police duties as a \u2018duly-appointed auxiliary\u2019 with the Jan-xhai Provisional Defence Force. All of the clans and syndicates that had a presence on the Grasp were expected to contribute in some way; most common was bribes, gratuities and a percentage of every deal that occurred in the system. Some Unbound paid in other ways \u2013 with information, cargo or favours. The larger clans would even provide ships \u2013 with appropriately valid identifications \u2013 for system defence, taking up the slack that the small and underfunded JDF couldn\u2019t handle.", "It might seem like giving a thief the keys to your house and telling them to keep it safe, but the Unbound valued the Grasp\u2019s neutrality. Keeping the system secure made it easier to make a profit. Few clans would willingly endanger their standing by deliberately disregarding local laws. Those asked to contribute vessels to the auxiliary forces considered it a mark of favouritism. Anyone who decided to harass shipping discovered their privileges severely curtailed, and the cost of doing business on the Grasp increasing substantially. Anyone who raided inside Jan-xhai received little mercy, often at the hands of their own peers.", "Grace was fulfilling the Red Hand\u2019s obligations to their hosts, policing the outer system to make sure any potential troublemakers stayed in line and performing \u2018random\u2019 checks of incoming traffic at the behest of the Grasp\u2019s administrators, and hating every minute of it. She messaged Allyria every day, sharing funny or aggravating stories.", "Allyria could have gone with her, but she\u2019d turned down the offer. She felt useless. It was worse aboard the ship. She couldn\u2019t go a full shift without her prosthetic giving her splitting headaches, making it hard to concentrate\u2026 just as much as doping herself up with painkillers. Without something to do, she felt ornamental.

She was sore all over, with bruises on her arms, legs and torso. She\u2019d been trying to spar again, and failing at it. Her movements were off. She stumbled, mis-timed attacks, hesitated too long. It wasn\u2019t just the blindness. Every time she faced someone else, even in a training match, she remembered. The look on Ransha\u2019s face as he died. The wet gagging sounds as Zirric\u00e9 drowned in his own blood, her knife in his throat. The feel of Ransha\u2019s body against hers as he convulsed with each shot she put into him. The warmth of the last breath he took on her skin.", "She\u2019d killed Verrisha. Not Compact soldiers like on Nemesis, or the crime-lord\u2019s serfs in that passage, but Verrisha.", "She hadn\u2019t lied when she\u2019d told Grace that both of the Grasp officers were scum. They\u2019d got what was coming to them. But they had been her people. Just like her, they\u2019d been stolen from their home in an attempt to destroy their culture, to make them better citizens of the Compact. The Verrisha were to be broken, no matter how long it took or how many lives were destroyed in the process.", "And because of her, there were two more names on that tally.", "Allyria didn\u2019t want to do that again, but she didn\u2019t know how she could avoid it. She couldn\u2019t not fight but right now, she couldn\u2019t do that at all. She hated that feeling, hated thinking she was a failure\u2026 hated being afraid that she might actually be a \u2018Brute\u2019\u2026 or that when she finally got her eyesight back, one day she\u2019d see fear\u2026 or disappointment in Grace\u2019s eyes. She didn\u2019t know which frightened her more.", "Verrisha were predators. The Compact hadn\u2019t called them Brutes entirely without reason, but they weren\u2019t savages one sidelong glance away from shedding blood in the streets. Now, every time she tried to be the soldier she wanted \u2013 she needed \u2013 to be, she felt a cold sickness and those memories came back, making her freeze, stumble and hesitate. She wanted to be whole again, but she didn\u2019t know if she would be.", "The young woman shook her head as if she could shake those thoughts loose. There was more wetness on her face, but this wasn\u2019t from the trees above. She wiped it away, hissing angrily at her own self-pity. She needed to be better than this. She wanted to be, but she didn\u2019t know how.", "The quiet here helped. She could almost pretend it was a real forest. She could remember, or pretend she remembered, what her home had been like and what she had to fight for.", "The young woman remained on the edge of the pond for some time. The respite ended as she heard movement through the underbrush. Allyria reached for her visor, feeling the familiar spike of pain as it interfaced with the implants connected to her optic nerves.

She wasn't allowed out of the spire - and often her quarters - without an escort now. The Prelate stood at the edge of the clearing, his nostrils flaring. \u201cI sent you a comm,\u201d he said in his thick accent. He had made progress in his enunciation of Compact Standard and he understood it quite well, but he still struggled with speaking the language.", "\u201cI turned it off,\u201d Allyria told him.

Released from their grasp, Tohil\u2019s thrusters pulsed and the cruiser accelerated slowly from Node 003 and back into open space. Out of all the survivors of Node 005, the blocky vessel had been the most heavily damaged, with a hull breach more than three hundred meters across and almost as deep, multiple smaller perforations, bulkhead collapses and systems failures.

As it was, it had spent the last four months in mechanical convalescence with its fellows.", "+diagnostics complete+ Violet Seven announced in a databurst. +systems confirm functional+", "The losses the Navy had inflicted on the Enemy had checked their advance. While the aliens had continued deeper into Confederate territory, their incursions had slowed considerably. With fewer scouting and screening units and the knowledge that the Fleet would gleefully target them, the foe had adopted a more measured approach, sending heavier units with each reconnaissance squadron to protect them, while keeping their vanguard and base of operations heavily protected against unexpected sallies. They were also digging into the territories they\u2019d taken, erecting minefields and listening posts. The Fleet had made several small probing attacks, more to let the foe know that they still had operational ships than to inflict any damage and to keep them from (rightfully) assuming that the path deeper into Confederate territory was clear. It seemed to have worked, at least in the short-term.", "The Navy had taught the Enemy caution; now, they were wary of encountering another Jor\u014dgumo, or drawing the attention of Nemesis. They didn\u2019t know it wasn\u2019t here. The flagship\u2019s absence was cause for concern. There\u2019d been no further word from Command since its courier had arrived nearly a year ago, with the instructions for the special project. That was now complete, freeing up resources for elsewhere. Nemesis had been absent before, sometimes for years or even longer, but never during those times had the Confederacy come under attack.", "The Kaiju was something for which the Fleet had real no answer for, and the Enemy was not foolish enough to leave it exposed, particularly after encountering Jor\u014dgumo.", "+if it could be boarded\u2026+ Nine had mused as she and her brother\u2019s ship-selves lay in drydock.

There was a pause, then a voice spoke through the intercom. \u201cCome in.\u201d The door unlocked and swung open. Inside was a female Mule, a C\u2019korvis\u2019mae. She had dark brown fur, yellow, black-tipped spinal plates and red eyes.", "Allyria had seen pictures of human mythical creatures called \u2018centaurs\u2019, and her own world had stories of similar creatures, half-beast and half-Verrish called allun tres. C\u2019korvis\u2019mae were like a grotesque reinterpretation of those beings. The species had long, triangular skulls, with one large eye set to either side of their head, and a third in the middle of their skull staring forward. From their temples to the tips of their whip-like tails were a row of bony protrusions. In males, these were larger, thicker and brightly-coloured \u2013 often supplemented with makeup and jewelry. Females had smaller, duller-coloured points.", "They had long jaws filled with multiple rows of teeth for slicing and grinding meat, bone and plants. On a human or Verrish, their arms would be disproportionately long and thin. At rest, they folded back against themselves; when stretched out, they could reach all the way behind their long abdomens or a fair distance in to the sides or front. Despite the skinniness of those limbs, they were dextrous, with protractible claws. A C\u2019korvis\u2019mae might not have a lot of strength in a punch, but it had a long reach to slash you, grab on, tilt its torso down, extend its neck and deliver a fatal bite.", "Their world had only just begun its version of an industrial revolution when the Compact contacted them. Now, they were known as \u2018Mules\u2019. They were quadrupedal pseudo-ungulates, ranging from five to nine feet tall. The shortest of their people were the equivalent of pygmies, once considered curiosities, slaves and even foodstuffs by the more dominant C\u2019korvis\u2019mae cultures. When the Compact had arrived, the smaller natives adapted more readily to their incorporation into the alien nation than their fellow races. Once a minority, now the pygmy C\u2019korvis\u2019mae made up the majority of the species. They had a coat of fine, silky fur that ranged from red to brown, or from black to white. The larger C\u2019korvis\u2019Mae had had different patterns in their coats, but their smaller counterparts tended to be a single colour; a blending of hues and patterns indicated a mixed parentage. They were a hardy species, able to thrive in many environments. Their physiology made them naturally adept at transport, making them excellent scouts and reconnaissance operatives, able to operate in harsh conditions, away from resupply for extended periods of time. They even functioned as their own pack animals.", "The apartment\u2019s owner eyed the Verrisha and the other Red Hand soldier uncomfortably. \u201cJust the Brute,\u201d she told Sirkauz.", "Allyria sensed Sirkauz shifting position, unhappy at the order from the other woman. \u201cIt will be fine,\u201d she assured him. \u201cYou\u2019ll be right outside.\u201d", "The Xensirii tipped his head and parted his jaws slightly, showing off just a little of his large, widely-spaced dagger teeth in a not-too-threatening grin. \u201cYes,\u201d he assured her, loud enough for the Mule to hear. \u201cI will.\u201d", "Allyria stepped into the apartment. The quadruped closed the door behind the Verrish and squeezed past her, leading her into the apartment. It was small in comparison to the quarters she and the other defectors shared in the Red Hand\u2019s spire, but big enough for its occupant. There was a large common room, a small kitchenette, bathroom, master bedroom and second small room. Allyria\u2019s tongue flicked out and she tasted the air. There were alien odours here, a mixture of species and her nose crinkled. She was used to the scent of her own people, humans, and of Tribunes and the handful of other Compact species that had settled on Rally. Here on the Grasp, she\u2019d become familiar with many others. Some of them smelt odd, others good and still others rank and foul. Grace had asked Allyria what humans smelled like to her. \u201cGood,\u201d was her answer.", "\u201cKiha te Neu,\u201d the other woman began, drawing her guest\u2019s attention. Allyria wasn\u2019t familiar with C\u2019korvis\u2019mae speech patterns and tones, but she thought she detected some antipathy. That wasn\u2019t surprising; the other woman was a Principality operative, placed on the Grasp to monitor Compact and pirate movements through the region and believed her cover was intact. Instead, she\u2019d been detected by the Red Hand\u2019s own intelligence apparatus before Grace and Allyria had set foot on the station, used as a means to communicate with Jirrico, left in place to serve as a pipeline between the \u2018Renegades\u2019 and the Principality. It had to be both a blow to her pride and frustrating to know that she was compromised, her safety relying on the operational security of pirates and terrorists.", "\u201cKiha M\u2019rrir\u2019in,\u201d Allyria replied. M\u2019rrir\u2019in\u2019s official job was a mid-level coordinator in Grasp Traffic Control. Her unofficial one was a self-employed middlewoman and prostitute. Traffic control was among the first voices any vessel heard when they arrived in-system. As the initial point of contact, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for the officers to get questions about accommodations, events, tariffs, and requests for general information. In most other star systems, those queries were politely routed to the appropriate departments. In Jan-xhai, traffic control were only too happy to get a foot in the door to facilitate deals, directing ships and crews to certain establishments or individuals in exchange for a small gratuity, or percentage. Some of the more entrepreneurial beings ran their own side businesses through their day jobs. M\u2019rrir\u2019in was one of these; in her cover as a moderately-corrupt civilian officer, she did what so many of her own peers did, using the connections she\u2019d to keep her tapped in to events in the underworld. Her liaisons provided both perfect cover for making contact with and passing information to other agents, and allowed her finagle information from her customers. Allyria respected that dedication. \u201cI spoke with our third friend,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe told me you had a message for my associate and I.\u201d", "Tavanis hadn\u2019t said what that message was; as far as need-to-know went, only Adrianna, Grace and Allyria knew about the offer that they\u2019d made to the Principality. The Overseer wasn\u2019t a fool, though; he knew some pact or promise between the Red Hand and the Principality was in the making, but the details of it were outside his station. He trusted his queen, even if he didn\u2019t fully understand what was in play. M\u2019rrir\u2019in had passed word from her superiors to him, and he had informed Allyria. With Grace more than sixteen hours away, the Verrish had come herself.", "Her tintas were shivering as she stepped into the apartment\u2019s living room. It was just big enough to be comfortable for the quadrupedal Mule and a few guests. The walls were decorated with imaging-cycling screens. It was the kind of place a middle-class person with a little more money than she should have would own. It wasn\u2019t the place that Allyria thought of when she imagined hearing of a decision that could change the galaxy. There couldn\u2019t be any other reason for M\u2019rrir\u2019in\u2019s summons, though.", "This was it. She felt her heart start to pound and her tintas stirred. This was why she and Grace had stayed on this station, why she\u2019d been in Ransha\u2019s sights. Why she\u2019d had to kill two of her own people. She prayed that this was worth it, but she knew the Principality hated and feared synthetic life as much as the Compact did. She thought of Red, her people\u2019s Kavili visarii, crippled and helpless, of the time slipping away\u2026", "\u201cI do,\u201d the four-legged woman said. She moved over to a shelf, picking up a match and lighting a scented candle. The odour of wet flowers filled the air as M\u2019rrir\u2019in settled into a chair \u2013 it was more of a sling \u2013 folding her four legs under her abdomen. \u201cI was instructed by our associate across the hall to tell you something very specific, with no embellishment, emphasis or interpretation.\u201d She turned her long, triangular head towards Allyria, the red eye in the center of her skull staring at the biped. \u201cI wasn\u2019t told what this message is in relation to, only that it was vitally important that it reach you as quickly as possible, with no possibly of misunderstanding or miscommunication.\u201d", "Allyria nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d Electricity seemed to arc from the tips of her head-tails to the base of her toes. Her stomach was fluttering and she reflexively licked her teeth. \u201cWhat is the message?\u201d She wished Grace were here. She deserved to be and hear this for herself, whatever it-", "\u201cYes,\u201d the woman said, interrupting Allyria\u2019s thoughts. \u201cThe answer to your proposal is yes.\u201d"]}

The only illumination came from the clock and the soft status indicators of the sleeping computer on a nearby desk. Many other species would have been unable to see at all, but the paired specialist eyes of the Vamanoa had helped their ancestors become the apex predator of Oada and themselves the soldiery of the Compact of Species. Nasham slowly sat up, pulling the blankets off his side of the round, high-sided bed, running one hand through his sleep-messed mane, his ears flattening slightly as he yawned.", "Beside him, Vinsea stirred, rolling onto her side and pulling the blankets up over her head. Nasham reached over and gave her shoulder a pat, eliciting a sleepy grunt from the young woman. He made his way into the washroom, splashing water over his face and muzzle to help wake himself, pouring himself a small bowl of cold water to lap up. Tribunes didn\u2019t drink from glasses or cups like many other species did; their facial structure didn\u2019t really allow for it.", "As Nasham emptied the dish, he heard movement behind him.

After he was finished in the shower, Vinsea took her turn. As she cleaned up, Nasham put his uniform on. It was the teal green with black banding and trim of the Compact Space Force. During his time on Rally, he\u2019d learned that purple was once considered a colour of royalty due to its rarity. On Oada, this shade of green-blue had been similarly regarded, until the Breaking of the Siege of Trilena, and a grateful monarch proclaimed that forevermore, his soldiers would be recognized for their honour and nobility. The tradition had spread from there, until centuries later it had become the standard for the unified Oadan military. After the Vamanoa had quashed the Great Betrayal and become Tribunes, the Space Force had adopted their colours in recognition of their deeds and to honour of their service.", "His rank pin was the copper hue of a Group Leader, trimmed in onyx to indicate his grade as a submissive.

He doubted they ever would, but they were no longer overwhelming. Several times already he had almost fallen into obsession, most recently with his focus on the Bequeathed humans. Each time, Vinsea had been there. Her job had been to keep him working, but there\u2019d been a burgeoning personal aspect to their interactions, and over the past few weeks it had become very personal indeed.", "He reached up and scratched the side of her muzzle. \u201cShe\u2019s not the only one I think of.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re deflecting.\u201d", "\u201cYes. Is it working?\u201d", "\u201cHrmp.\u201d Vinsea snorted. She pulled away, picking her own uniform up from where she\u2019d left it, cleaned and folded neatly in the closet. Her uniform and rank pin were the same as Nasham\u2019s own, though the service patch over her left breast differed from his; Nasham\u2019s was the sigil of the Space Force itself: against the background of the Great Spiral, a gunmetal chain encircled a small blue point of light, six vivid red spears stabbing out from its center, across the galaxy. The chain stood for the binding oaths and duty of the Space Force with the closed nature of that circle represeningd the protection provided to the many worlds under their watch. The emergent points were the Compact\u2019s military going behind their own borders to do what needed to be done, as their duty required.", "Vinsea wore the service sigil of military intelligence: a network of chains being woven into a tapestry adorned with a miniature symbol of the Space Force, symbolizing how the smallest and most insignificant of things could be used to create something greater, just as analysts and operatives took disparate whispers and faint leads, weaving them from possibilities into potentialities.", "\u201cWe should get something to eat,\u201d Vinsea said as she buttoned up her collar.", "\u201cWhile we have the chance.\u201d Nasham tilted his head in agreement. Breakfast sounded good, and one outside the confines of his quarters was acceptable. \u201cI suspect it will be a busy day.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Vinsea confirmed, meeting Nasham\u2019s eyes. \u201cWe have another hollow gourd to shatter.\u201d", "~", "\u201cSystems stabilized,\u201d Operations reported. \u201cEyes clear, scopes up.\u201d", "\u201cAcknowledged,\u201d Grace said from her command chair as she looked over ship status reports and diagnostics as Brightest Night emerged from its after-shock paralytic blindness. \u201cScopes \u2013 is there anyone in our neighbourhood?\u201d", "\u201cReading two drive signatures within five million kilometers, both escort-weight. Detecting multiple mine canisters across our scope horizon. Tracking augurs are active, but the weapons aren\u2019t armed.\u201d", "\u201cEyes on, but no claws out,\u201d Colony Zanim noted. The aphorism was a learned one; Conjoiners might have eyes, but not claws.", "Grace nodded. Brightest Night had shocked into Kebrak Daun into the middle of one of the local minefields, but by itself, the corvette wasn\u2019t nearly enough to trigger a hostile reaction. That would change with the utterance of a command transmission from the two nearby hounds, or any of the other Argosy assets within the fortress system, but Brightest Night not only had the proper authentication codes, it was also expected.", "\u201cTransmission from one of the escorts,\u201d Communications reported, listening a moment. \u201cThey\u2019re requesting our identification.\u201d", "Grace tried not to think about the butterflies in her stomach. \u201cGive me a private channel,\u201d she said, keeping her voice even. Communications routed the commands through Proctor\u2019s station, and she sent back a simple response, keying in the identifiers that M\u2019rrir\u2019in had provided. The Principality and the Red Hand might be unspoken allies, but the presence of an unregistered \u2018Renegade\u2019 ship was always cause for concern. Jirrico had provided an IFF registry and a set of comm codes to identify whatever ship responded to his communique, just to make sure that there were no accidents upon their arrival. Nothing could be left to chance. As that thought crossed Grace\u2019s mind, she took a look over her shoulder at Allyria and her gut tightened.", "Later.", "Moments passed. Finally, the Argosy vessel answered, its captain\u2019s words translated from All Common to Compact Standard. \u201cAuthentication accepted, Brightest Night. Follow us to your destination. Remain on passive sensors only. Do not deviate from your assigned path.\u201d", "The comm officer turned to regard Grace sitting in her command chair. \u201cThey\u2019ve sent us a nav course.\u201d", "\u201cRoute it to the helm and lay it in.\u201d", "As Brightest Night came about to follow the route they\u2019d been assigned, Allyria spoke up. \u201cIs it just me,\u201d the Verrish put in, stepping up next to Grace. Even though she wasn\u2019t standing on the dais, she was still taller than the human. \u201cOr do they seem touchier than the last time we were here?\u201d", "Grace was silent for a moment. Allyria was right. \u201cShow me the system map.\u201d", "Her sensor officer complied, projecting onto the main viewscreen an image of everything the corvette\u2019s long-range sensors could see. Brightest Night had weaker scanners and a smaller sense horizon than even the antiquated Bequeathed, but from what Grace could tell, Kebrak Daun was even busier than her last visit. The Argosy was taking Sundial seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s not just you,\u201d she agreed. Both of them had already known the answer. If the Principality weren\u2019t desperate, they wouldn\u2019t have accepted the offer. It was worth saying, though. At least for the sake of the crew.", "Brightest Night\u2019s old and new personnel were good, but they weren\u2019t part of the Red Hand\u2019s inner circles. All they knew was that Her Majesty\u2019s proxies had received an important message and were rushing to attend to it. Most of the rumours centered on the Principality, ranging from a potential public endorsement of the Red Hand, to the arrival of new \u2018technical advisors\u2019 or the turning over of various technologies for \u2018field testing\u2019. Grace hadn\u2019t contradicted any of them, but she had put the ship on high security. The only records of what Brightest Night was seeing would go into an encrypted datafile, to be seen by only one other set of eyes. Everything else would remain a rumour.", "It had taken surprisingly little finagling to get Brightest Night a leave of absence from its duties in Jan-xhai. With time in an unknown, but definitely short supply, Grace and Allyria had decided to go to the Principality themselves. Tavanis would send a courier carrying an encrypted datafile to Adrianna so that she would be apprised of the situation. Grace hadn\u2019t wanted to overstep her authority again \u2013 the\u2026 \u2018discussion\u2019 she\u2019d had with Leblanc after the first talks with Jirrico had made an impression \u2013 but she\u2019d been in agreement with Allyria. They had to move on this as quickly as possible. Nemesis was still laid up, still slowly eking her way to recovery while the Compact pressed deeper into the Black Veil, their fleets swarmed through the Principality and Galhemna armoured itself more each day. The weeks it would take to get in touch with the Leblanc and either get her instructions, or have her come to Kebrak Daun might be weeks they didn\u2019t have.", "The Red Queen would be able to coordinate the next shipments, but this one was the most critical, the one they most needed to get to Nemesis and Hekate as soon as possible. That was Allyria\u2019s rationale, and Grace couldn\u2019t disagree. In theory, at least. In practice\u2026", "Later, she told herself again. Not that it would really do any good.", "She and Allyria had left the station almost as soon as Brightest Night had docked, arranging things with the Overseer while the corvette had been en route. The Yengesae wasn\u2019t entirely sanguine with the situation; Jan-xhai in specific and operations throughout the Idle Depths in general were his responsibility. A clandestine operation being run without his knowledge here had to rankle, but ameliorating that was that it was at his queen\u2019s direct command. Tavanis was a loyal member of the Red Hand. Many other officers might have felt slighted that their monarch had put her faith in two very new recruits instead of them, but the Overseer did not. Tavanis had never spoken on it, but Grace had gotten the impression that the trust the Yengesae had for his queen was more than that of a subordinate for his superior. Kobold and Broken; two species that had almost nothing in common, yet there were bonds of loyalty between them.", "Just like a long-forgotten AI with the small, mayfly organics that walked her halls and the people two thousand years removed from those who\u2019d built her. Everything Grace had learned in twenty-one years told her that those bonds couldn\u2019t exist. Everything she\u2019d learned in the last months proved all of that had been lies. Red One had trusted Grace and the other survivors with this mission. They had to complete it, despite the costs. They\u2019d lost Marcus. They\u2019d lost Lydia. She\u2019d almost lost Allyria. It was time to stop that. It was time to make the Compact lose for a change. To cripple one of their lynchpins and tear their planned victory out from under them.", "As the time ticked by and Brightest Night followed its two silent wardens, Grace soon saw the first step to making that happen. Or rather, the first two steps.", "~", "Debris, none of it larger than a fingernail and most of it little more than stripped atoms and molecular gas, drifted through the emptiness of interstellar space in imitation of a planetary nebula. The largest pieces glittered faintly as searchlights played over them in hopes of discovering something worth salvaging. There was nothing, though. Nothing that could provide even the smallest details about what the structure at the center of the expanding cloud of dust had once been.", "Yunl\u2019ro counted slowly to fourteen, letting out a breath through her nostril slits. She considered herself an even-tempered woman, but this mission was trying her patience in a way few others in her career had. There was no one to blame for this latest annoyance, though. The enemy machines preferred suicide to capture \u2013 if you could even call a machine\u2019s self-destruction a \u2018suicide\u2019 \u2013 and this space station had been no exception. What was once a conglomeration of metal and ceramic nearly four kilometers in diameter was now nothing but sundered atoms and minuscule hull fragments.", "A recon squadron had found this installation four days ago. It was luck and cunning that had led them here; the former as their ships had been spooling their shock drives back up close enough to detect the faint, nearly imperceptible signals coming from the citadel and the latter when the squadron\u2019s prime divined that that was not background emissions from the nebula, nor the faded remains of transmissions from ships and planets outside the Black Veil. They had investigated, discovering this base two and a half light-years from the nearest star.", "It had had only minimal defences; a small minefield and a pair of Q-ships, both of them armed only with civilian-rated weaponry. There\u2019d been no losses, nor even any real damage to the Execution Force. Once the two defenders had been destroyed and a path through the minefield was swept, the facility had self-destructed. Long-range augur probes had been unable to determine what it had been built for; it was half-asteroid, and half an incomprehensible goulash of ship and citadel components with parts from a minimum of four different nations. The fleet\u2019s strategists, engineers and analysts were baffled as to what it purpose it might have served. The facility was well-shielded, with virtually no signal leakage, and what augurs had detected provided no real information either.", "There were thoughts that it was another lure, but the investment of resources that citadel represented was substantial, far above a few captured and scavenged freighters. It\u2019s self-destruction had also denied the execution force any possibility of being lured. There wasn\u2019t even enough to give them a false lead. No, this had had a purpose, but whatever it had been was now a mystery.", "\u201cAugur sweep complete,\u201d Scopes reported. \u201cNo sign of any other vessels. We have detected minor gravitic fluctuations.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro nodded. \u201cPlot them on screen 4. Run them through the new identification subroutines.\u201d \u2018New\u2019, she thought sourly. Old, rather. Very old.", "One of the displays obediently came up with the incoming telemetry. Yunl\u2019ro considered the information. She didn\u2019t need the computer\u2019s analysis. She already knew what she was going to see. Intuition again.", "\u201cThere,\u201d the Thoughtful said as the confirmation she\u2019d expected came in. The gravitic anomalies were dispersing; within a few hours there would be no trace of them at all. But until they did, the unique signatures they possessed told a story of something moving unseen, like the flukeprints an oceangoing beast created as it swam just under the surface. Something had fled from that station recently. Something using a gravity drive.", "Just as distortion drives were the preeminent sublight propulsion system for this era, gravity drives had been dominant among the few known older, extinct star nations. The Anorax had used this technology, but there were multiple iterations of it; the fading gravitic disruptions here were a possible match to at least two of those variants. In a functioning gravity drive, a starship used minor gravitic pulses to change course and velocity, much like the metaphorical sea-beast used undulations of its tail to push itself through the water. These fluctuations lacked any thermal or electromagnetic signatures and were extremely hard to detect. A starship using a gravity drive for locomotion could become almost impossible to locate.", "The operation of a gravity impulse system also required far less energy than a distortion drive. Those benefits should have made them quite useful even in the current era, but there were rather large trade-offs. Gravity drive systems were massive; the Compact had yet to discover an example that was less than thirty-five percent of a vessel\u2019s total mass, and most easily surpassed forty \u2013 even fifty \u2013 percent. Once other vital systems were installed, such as the primary and secondary reactors, environmental controls and maneuvering impulsers, there was little room left for anything else. Even space for weaponry and defences became severely limited.", "Despite their comparatively low energy draw, a gravity drive was an incredibly inefficient piece of hardware. Running the drives continuously not only swiftly became a substantial power drain, but the gravitic fluctuations became far easier to detect. To reduce that energy cost and remain covert, most vessels were limited in how rapidly, and how much they could accelerate, decelerate or charge course within a short period of time. An active gravity drive also interfered with screens; a vessel either had to choose between maneuver and defence. The Anorax and at least one other civilization had managed to weaponize their drives, using gravity fields to push incoming ordnance away, and refract energy fire away from their hulls, though this still compromised their sublight acceleration and maneuvering, and if the drive failed, the vessel was left defenceless.", "Lastly, but far from least, a gravity drive prevented the opening of a shockpoint. Distortion drives also had to be shut down prior to FTL jumps, both to feed the massive power requirements of the shock systems and to prevent a vessel\u2019s own wake from destabilizing the portal; but this period was measured in moments, perhaps minutes depending on circumstances. Even the most advanced gravity drive needed to be inactive for an hour or more before a shockpoint could be safely initiated. Squadrons and fleets also required far greater dispersal to ensure that one vessel\u2019s drive did not endanger its comrades\u2019 arrivals or departures.", "Throughout the Compact\u2019s history, there had been periodic attempts to revisit the technology, but nothing really came of them. The last time Yunl\u2019ro had even heard of gravity drives being used was in the last season of Brightest Stars, where the crew of the Parahelion faced off against an alien stealth battleship equipped with a drive far more capable and effective than any design outside of fiction could be, but what\u2019d they\u2019d witnessed in Husk came closer to the Parahelion\u2019s nemesis than anything the Compact had seen before. That was how the unclassified titan-grade vessel over had eluded them over Husk Seven. It not only had a gravity drive, but a weaponized one. Now that the execution force knew what to look for, they had a greater chance of spotting that vessel, as they had just proven. Whatever that ship was, it had just been here, withdrawing scant hours before the arrival of Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s armada.", "Simply through its existence, a plethora of questions were raised: where had the Wound acquired it? Was it salvage or had the abominate intelligence developed the technology itself? Why would their quarry even want such anachronistic technology? Even accounting for the difficulty in detecting a gravity drive, the Wound\u2019s shroud systems were far superior, as evidenced by the Scar, the Splinters, and Slashes. What had been this vessel\u2019s mission in Husk, and what was it here? It had not engaged the fleet in either of its appearances, so what was its purpose?", "Every day she spent in the Black Veil provided more questions and fewer answers.", "There was at least some good fortune, though; thanks to Bastion Leader Kemk, several fresh ships had arrived to help bolster the execution force\u2019s scouting and picket forces. As her ships made good their repairs, Yunl\u2019ro had adopted a policy of reconnaissance in force. It meant a slower, more cautious method exploration, but it reduced the chance of ambushes like those the enemy had already sprung. At the moment, it appeared to be working. The number of raids and probes had decreased, but correlation was not causation. That could be due to any combination of factors, including the losses the foe had suffered in Husk\u2026 or that the enemy was marshalling their forces.", "\u201cContinue augur sweeps of the debris,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro told her crew. They would not find anything, but that was no reason not to be thorough. Something might turn up, and thoroughness was preferable to laxity. The next wave of scouts would be sent out shortly, and the van would move on.", "Another system claimed, another victory to be recorded. More ashes to offer. More questions, and still far too few answers.", "~", "Upon the command pulpit of the battlecruiser Goring Spear, Noble Fleet Lord Jirrico waited for the arrival of the neverborn\u2019s puppets. That was an uncharitable thought, but in his darker moments, he\u2019d wondered if the Broken and Brute he\u2019d seen had truly been themselves, or if they were something else. The Compact of Species and the Askanj Principality had signed a treaty forbidding the wide-scale use of weaponized nanotechnology, and they enforced that upon their own nations and others when needed, but Chrysalis heeded no such restrictions. It used infectious machine spores to infiltrate and disrupt physical systems, both mechanical and organic, just as its viral programs spread through software. The most horrific of the many reports Jirrico had read of Chrysalis spoke of living beings infested and used as biological mannequins, forced to speak and act by clusters of machines gestating within their brains, hijacking their very flesh.", "Had the women he\u2019d seen actually been allies of the machine? Or were they just hosts, compelled to speak and act according to its will? He didn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t want to know. What he wanted was for his nation to survive. All other considerations were secondary. That was why this devils\u2019 pact was being made, why the Noble Fleet Lord went to sleep each night with thoughts of millennia-old fables and warnings running through his head, and why he hoped that what he was doing was not only necessary, but right.", "The wheel of fate turned, dragging everyone and everything towards their beginnings before grinding them down into their inevitable ends. Both moments were here now.", "Jirrico stepped over to the display table that took up the forward-right side of his pulpit. Light codes, holographic displays and polymimetic metal came together to show him an image of local space. Forty thousand kilometers away were the twin planets of Phrel-Os and Phrel-Saam; Kebrak Daun was a binary system, but the primary\u2019s partner was a dark, near-dead sun that once belonged to the elliptical galaxy surrounding the Diamond Path. Captured eons ago, it was now the most distant of Kebrak Daun\u2019s satellites, orbiting the primary star in an oblong path that took hundreds of thousands of years to traverse. Three million years ago, this stellar corpse had come close enough that its gravitational shear had wrenched Kebrak\u2019s ninth planet apart, the two irregular halves now circling each other as they continued their own orbit around the star, a field of debris between and surrounding them.", "The Noble Fleet Lord placed his hands on the sides of the display tank. Hidden in the interstitial space between the bisected planet and its slowly spinning entrails was one of the command centers for Kebrak Daun\u2019s outer-system defence perimeter, and concealed along with the pallisade were several rapid-response squadrons. Should an enemy invade Kebrak Daun, these vessels would emerge to strike at their supply trains, or launch a sally into the foe\u2019s rear. It wasn\u2019t the assemblage of escorts and light capital ships that had his attention, though. Jirrico\u2019s gaze was drawn towards two signals in particular.", "Newcomers that dwarfed every starship around them, each was bigger than the Argosy\u2019s heaviest supercarriers, but they were not warships. They were transports. Galactic Administrant class, the largest spacegoing hulls that the Principality had ever constructed. More than nine kilometers long, they could carry vast amounts of cargo. Each of those ships was so expensive that only the largest corporations, planetary regencies and the government itself could afford to build and operate more than a handful at once. As far as anyone was concerned now, those ships did not exist. No records of their existence would be logged, no communication with those vessels would be made and no one would be allowed aboard them. Official registries already recorded those transports as lost in a failed transition, their fictitious complements listed as \u2018missing\u2019 and the loss of their goods bemoaned. Only in Jirrico\u2019s personal, most secure archives would their final mission be noted.", "The ships no longer officially existed, but Jirrico refused to assume that the Compact would remain perpetually unaware of this development. If they or any other of the tithe vessels were noticed, a cover story was already in place. Beneath the \u2018official\u2019 explanation lay the second level of deception. Vizier Suun Rin Tor was forging data tracks and modifying manifests; any spies or enemy agents who dug for information would find evidence of increased maintenance reports and requests for ordnance experts, engineering teams and special components from the outer-system outposts. They would conclude that Kebrak Daun was covertly improving their defences, using a cover story to conceal the shipments. There was just enough truth to make it believable and convince any enemy agent of what they\u2019d \u2018discovered\u2019.", "Those two vessels did indeed carry weaponry, but that was only a small fraction of the countless millions of tonnes of cargo that filled their holds. Raw materials, processed alloys, starship components and industrial goods \u2013 enough to build a squadron of warships. This were only the first shipment though, these two freighters were the fastest to be stocked. More would be coming, with enough resources that the Argosy could have built and outfitted a fleet from them... but not soon enough. Not before Sundial launched. Even now, Jirrico doubted that anything would come of this\u2026 but the odds, whatever they happened to be for Chrysalis, were better than the Argosy\u2019s chances against Galhemna. They traded a fleet they might have time to build, for an engine that could be ready faster.", "He knew his peers were neither insouciant nor casual about the idea of feeding a neverborn... particularly this one, but the speed at which the Argosy Nobility had agreed surprised even him. Jirrico knew the strategic situation as well as any amongst the fleet\u2019s peerage, but things had to be even worse than he thought. He wasn\u2019t sure how that could be, but he was not on the front lines. Yet.", "His crests ached as they swelled, an outward symptom of his inner anxiety. With some effort, he managed to suppress that emotion, feeling the soreness in his scalp recede as his crests deflated. Each of those tiny light codes represented more wealth than some worlds could produce in a year or more: enough to build the ships, munitions and outfit the armies that the Principality badly needed... but not soon enough.", "So he was here to put all of that before him and more into the hands of a neverborn and hope that what it did with that would be enough to save his nation. To be strapped to the wheel as it rolled ever onward.", "The ironies of fate, Jirrico thought as he stared at the screen for a very long time. The monsoons had come. He could only hope that when the waters receded, his people had not been dragged down into them by the lost soul to whom they had offered help.", "\u201cThe Red Hand vessel is coming into our visual range now,\u201d Sensors noted.", "Jirrico tilted his head, gesturing over the display table to shift its focus. The Renegade ship was a small corvette, escorted by the frigate Parasitoid Birth and the destroyer Hunger Axe. \u201cHail them,\u201d he told his communications offer. \u201cOnce they respond, route the signal to my office.\u201d", "The Renegade\u2019s reply was not long in coming. On the screen in Jirrico\u2019s temporary office aboard the battlecruiser, a Broken\u2019s face appeared. Her skin was a slight shade of olive, her green eyes a colour completely unnatural to the Askanj-anj, her appearance repugnant and alien. The few similarities between Broken and Askanj-anj only made the differences more glaringly evident, the species more grotesque, like a warped vision of an Askanj-anj made by someone without the right parts and settling for whatever they had at hand.", "\u201cNoble Fleet Lord,\u201d the Broken female addressed him in accented All Common.

We can talk more there.\u201d", "The woman\u2019s tri-coloured eyes blinked. \u201cUnderstood,\u201d she said, comprehending his intention.

There was an encrypted message accompanying the Onyx. We\u2019ve deciphered it as \u2018Primary colours\u2019.\u201d There was puzzlement in Drexil\u2019s tone. He didn\u2019t understand the reference. There were three primary colours: blue, yellow and red. Te Neu\u2019s skin, Proctor\u2019s hair and the obvious third connection.

Each vessel was too large for the three of them to fully examine in any reasonable amount of time, which only reinforced Allyria\u2019s point that one of them needed to stay, just in case the Principality had left behind any surprises.", "The Noble Fleet Lord was back aboard his flag, arranging some last-minute details with his forces before releasing Wandering Tide-991538 and Travelling Wind-432511 to the women. They\u2019d returned to Brightest Night to do the same. After Grace had checked in with her staff, she had gone to their quarters to find Allyria packed and ready. Grace insisted that one person aboard one ship was hardly better than no one at all, but Allyria maintained that it was better than nothing. The stakes were too high, she said, to leave anything more to chance than they already were.", "That she was right only upset Grace more. She\u2019d tried a different tack; Adrianna had left them a few items. One was a datachip specifically keyed to the Red Queen; if anyone else tried to access it, it would destroy itself. That was on its way to Leblanc now, detailing everything they had already done and were going to do. Another gift was something from Nemesis. Though it also appeared as a widely-available, completely unremarkable datachip, it was home to an incredibly advanced (and malevolent, if one was inclined to anthropomorphize) parasitoid program, developed by Red One. Once installed in any Compact or Principality computer systems, it sought out and destroyed security applications, keyloggers, monitoring software and any other espionage or defensive protocols, taking over their functions to make it appear as they were still working. After that, it overrode navigational control to guide the vessel to the coordinates it was given.", "Adrianna carried several versions of these attack programs in her implants, but without cybernetics of their own, Grace and Allyria had to rely on the datachips to get the programs into their targets. It had been tricky, but they\u2019d managed to install the software into each ship during their tours, without Jirrico or any of the Argosy vessels monitoring the freighters being any the wiser.", "Grace had made a half-hearted effort to insist that that was good enough; Adrianna herself used these to dispatch ships to, and communicate with, Nemesis without needing to personally accompany each and every one. Allyria came back with what Grace already knew: Leblanc was sending vessels that the Red Hand had seized and scoured, not merely accepting them from another source with no time to properly vet them. Even with Brightest Night\u2019s entire crew \u2013 a security breach waiting to happen \u2013 it would take days, or even longer to clear both ships. Time they didn\u2019t have, and a risk they couldn\u2019t take.", "The Principality\u2019s back was against the wall, and it would be monumentally stupid to endanger this alliance right after making it, but the Principality didn\u2019t trust any neverborn, particularly not one in a dreadnought body. That fear, and their own greed had led them to make questionable decisions in the past. If they thought they could get some intelligence, or even take Nemesis for themselves, they might make the attempt now. The Askanj needed \u2018Chrysalis\u2019, but they didn\u2019t trust her, and never would. The parasitoid program couldn\u2019t do anything if a sleeper team with a mindkiller had been hidden away, or a dormant drone activated, sampled navigational data and cut its way out of the ship. The odds were low that they\u2019d do anything rash on the first shipment \u2013 aside from the expected espionage programs that Red\u2019s parasitoid had already sorted out \u2013 but the chance was there, and if the odds were low that one person on one ship could do anything, those odds were still better than having no one at all.", "\u201cGrace\u2026\u201d Allyria began. She didn\u2019t want to have this argument again.", "The smaller woman stayed poised and defiant for a moment longer, then deflated. \u201cI know,\u201d she said at last, covering her eyes with one hand. \u201cGod damn it, I know.\u201d", "The Verrish reached out, cupping the right side of Grace\u2019s head in her left hand. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she promised.", "Grace leaned into her lover\u2019s touch. She wanted to protest \u2013 Allyria was only staying in case things were not fine \u2013 but she stayed silent. She was worried. The other girl was still blind. If something happened to her prosthetic, if something happened to her\u2026 \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go,\u201d she was all she said. \u201cBut you\u2019re right.\u201d She hated making that admission. One of them had to go, and one of them had to stay. She wrapped her hands around Allyria\u2019s arm, pressing her face further into the Verrish\u2019s palm. Allyria stroked her fingertips over Grace\u2019s cheeks and scalp, the smaller woman closing her eyes to enjoy this small far-too-brief moment.", "\u201cI\u2019ll have your things sent over,\u201d the human said in capitulation. After a moment, she let go of Allyria\u2019s arm. She reached up and touched the taller girl\u2019s cheekbones, just under her eyes. \u201cAre you going to let her heal those?\u201d", "In response, Allyria made a deep, low purr and kissed the top of Grace\u2019s head. \u201cYou should head back to command. The fleet lord\u2019s probably wondering what\u2019s taking us so long.\u201d", "Grace nodded, finally breaking their embrace. She didn\u2019t want to let Allyria go by herself, not when she was still injured. Not when there was any risk. She felt ridiculous and selfish about the whole thing. So many others had given much more for this cause, and she was balking at being separated from Allyria for a few weeks.", "But. But, ever since they\u2019d been children, they\u2019d hardly ever been apart. But, they finally had each other in the way they\u2019d both wanted, but Grace had been too afraid to act on. But, Allyria was still blind, still recovering \u2013 not just physically. But, if something happened, Grace wanted to be there. But, it felt like abandoning her. But, Alan had left and he\u2019d never come back. Lydia and Marcus had left, and they never came back. Grace had left her parents and she wasn\u2019t going to see them again. Every time she left someone, it could very well be for the last time. She wasn\u2019t sure if she could do this alone.", "For all those reasons, she wanted to keep arguing, even though she knew she\u2019d lost. Instead of that, she craned her neck up, rose up on her tiptoes and took Allyria\u2019s face in her small human hands, kissing her deeply. \u201cI love you,\u201d she said.", "\u201cI love you too.\u201d", "Grace smiled. Her eyes were misty. \u201cYou\u2019re coming back to me.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. It was an order. In answer, Allyria kissed her again. Finally, there was no more delaying. \u201cCome on,\u201d Grace told Allyria. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure you have everything, then I\u2019ll walk you to the shuttle.\u201d"]}

The vessel looked like a battered and weathered Sgina-class messenger, but beneath the century-old chassis was a vessel much faster and more capable than almost any other civilian-rated courier. Like the others of its type, Chasing Dawn was virtually nothing but sublight engines and shock systems that had been stripped to the bare minimum necessary to remain functional. Couriers were expensive to operate, needed heavy maintenance and required substantial overhauls after only a handful of FTL jumps. Few Unbound cartels could afford the onerous operational costs of maintaining them. Even the Red Hand relied on larger, multirole starships to relay information, but over the decades they had bought, stolen and built a small number of couriers for emergencies. Some were advanced models like Try Again, or Eisheth\u2019s own Lazarus. Others were like Chasing Dawn\u2019s Rising Light, but most were every inch the salvaged, refurbished hulls that they appeared to be.", "Landing struts unfolded from the underside of the smaller vessel; relative to the courier\u2019s size, they looked comically small, but they were sturdy, thick and capable of taking the starship\u2019s weight. Chasing Dawn eased itself onto the pocket battleship\u2019s deck, mooring claws moving to secure the vessel. A gangway extended, pairing with the starboard airlock. A solid seal was made and the door opened.", "The courier\u2019s pilot emerged, a Harrimun carrying a single case in his long-fingered, gloved hands. He held it as if it were live explosives. \u201cMajesty,\u201d he said with a salute, offering the case to Adrianna. His ship was downloading its database to Eisheth even now, but some items were never entered in the computer. They were for her alone. The warship\u2019s crew was long used to their queen\u2019s eccentricities and occasionally unexplained comings and goings, the messages she received from unknown sources and the other infrequent odd behaviours. They might gossip and whisper to each other, but they trusted Leblanc.", "She\u2019d spent more than half a century forging that loyalty. Men and women had died \u2013 often in ugly ways \u2013 because of their faith in her. They\u2019d charged enemy gun-lines trusting that their sacrifice wouldn\u2019t be squandered. They\u2019d carried out suicide strikes, taken their own lives rather than be captured and even endured painful, gruesome deaths at an interrogator\u2019s hands rather than betray her or the cause. Fanatical was the word her foes used, spitting it like a curse. Devoted was what she preferred\u2026", "\u2026but even if that devotion seemed unbreakable, it was also unspeakably fragile. Her correspondence, let alone her alliance, with Nemesis was as close to blasphemy as it was possible to get within the Compact.

The litany of atrocities lain at the feet of rampant AIs or civilizations who had used them was not something easily overcome.", "Adrianna herself would be considered an abomination or a blindsight construct; cybernetics were common enough, but the extent of her enhancements marked her as too far from fully organic to be a \u201creal\u201d person.

Some might still follow her even if they did, but many would not.

It was rigged to immolate its contents after only a few failed access attempts. Retinal scans, thumbprints and biometrics were next. The security might seem excessive, but she didn\u2019t underestimate her enemies. Compact intelligence was neither sloppy or slow. She\u2019d seen more than one syndicate fall because of poor information control\u2026 her first (and almost final) failure at Unicorn Set included. The Red Hand had spent decades frustrating Compact intelligence, police and enforcer services because they took their security so seriously.", "Besides, it wasn\u2019t only the Compact she had to hide certain information from\u2026", "The case opened. Inside it was a flimsi from Tavanis and a single small datachip. Adrianna would deal with the former later. She recognized the latter; it was one of the few she\u2019d left Proctor and te Neu. Any attempt to activate it without the proper authorization \u2013 even more stringent than that of the security case \u2013 would result in it immediately erasing itself. Any attempt to forcibly bypass the locking mechanism would cause irreparable damage to the molecular circuitry inside, rendering it just as useless.", "Adrianna had wondered if it would be possible to further discourage nosy parkers; microexplosives were one avenue. A colony of attack nanites had been another. The former hadn\u2019t been practical and Red had pointed out that weaponized nanomachines would instantly arouse suspicions. So she had to settle for this.", "Life can be so unfair at times, Adrianna thought with a small smile as she slid the chip into her personal \u2018scroll. The final decryption sequence done entirely within her own implants; what showed on the screen was complete nonsense, but to Leblanc, it was as clear as day. The information it provided was brief and to the point. The smile on Adrianna\u2019s face widened and she felt a shiver of excitement race from the tip of her toes to the crown of her head.

To many species, even humans who\u2019d evolved from primates that lived in troops, a Verrish\u2019s sense of personal space could be invasive. What the former saw as simple, comfortable proximity or harmless social interactions and physical contact other species considered threatening or inappropriate. That was one of the reasons Brutes were considered so primitive and \u2018low\u2019 by the Compact and its more civilized peoples. Including too many of the Envoy Children\u2019s own foster parents, Allyria\u2019s included.", "For the first few years of her life on Rally, she\u2019d felt utterly and completely alone. Surrounded by aliens \u2013 by humans that knew nothing of their Kavili visarii \u2013 she\u2019d been chastised for seemingly everything. Even trying to reach out for some kind of comfort had often resulted in censure. She\u2019d only rarely seen her fellow Envoys \u2013 they were supposed to unlearn the primitive, antisocial cultural traits of their species, and how was that going to happen if you let the Brutes congregate and reinforce their negative viewpoints and opinions? Everything had been taken from her, even the simple necessity of another living being\u2019s touch.", "Anna Proctor had been the first human on Rally to really understand that. Grace had followed her mother\u2019s lead and Mr. Proctor had come to accept her, too. Even her foster parents had become more understanding, but they\u2019d never really had the same connection that Allyria had had with Anna, Charles\u2026 and Grace.", "Allyria had been with Grace for so long that she was a bigger part of her life than her own family had been. That thought was\u2026 it wasn\u2019t a pleasant one. One night that she\u2019d been sleeping over at Grace\u2019s, it had suddenly struck that she\u2019d known Grace and the Proctors longer than she had her own parents. Sick and scared at that realization, Allyria had curled into a ball and started crying softly. Grace must have heard, because she\u2019d come over to Allyria and burrowed into her arms. She\u2019d asked what was wrong, but Allyria couldn\u2019t answer her. Instead, Grace just let the other girl hold onto her to like she would have with any other member of her family, giving her that small measure of comfort when she needed it. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Allyria wouldn\u2019t have traded Grace\u2019s company and companionship for anything in the world, but realizing that she\u2019d known an alien longer than her own parents had hurt, driving home just how unlikely it was that she\u2019d ever see them again.", "Even on the days that she\u2019d been by herself, Allyria remembered that moment, holding Grace until the fear and loneliness ebbed away. She remembered Anna holding her when she was still shaking with rage. She remembered  Charles sitting next to her on the couch after Allyria\u2019d had another fight with her foster parents, Grace\u2019s father putting a comforting hand on her head. She remembered her own parents, the feel of their arms around her. The slow, even sounds of their breathing. The way they\u2019d smelled, the sense of them in her tintas. The presence of her grandfather, her uncles and her cousins and the sounds of their voices.", "No, for a long time now, she\u2019d never been alone. Not really.", "This was different. The massive freighter\u2019s barren halls and rooms just went on and on. It was too empty and with her blindness, it was even more unsettling. Even the memories she\u2019d held onto seemed small and faint against the unending void that was the crewless Wandering Tide-991538. By the end of the second day, she was jumpy, twitching at unfamiliar noises and sensations from her head-tails. On the third day, the silence got to be too much for her. She\u2019d known this journey would be\u2026 disconcerting, but she\u2019d kept that to herself. If Grace had known what it would be like for Allyria, she\u2019d have never agreed to let her go by herself. She\u2019d probably suspected, but without actually knowing\u2026", "Besides, technically, she wasn\u2019t really talking to herself. It was more like dictating a letter. That eased the sense of isolation. Sometimes she\u2019d talk to other people. Her family back on Vara, Red One, some of the other friends she\u2019d had on Rally, the Proctors \u2013 even the Parkers. She talked to Grace the most, though.", "Allyria moved down the corridors, her prosthetic visor hanging from her hip. She was memorizing the freighter\u2019s layout, making a mental map of the routes from her quarters to the ship\u2019s vital areas and between them. She was getting better at it. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d actually need it, but it was something to do. \u201cBesides,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s what we talked about, isn\u2019t it? The odds are low\u2026 but if I need to get somewhere without my visor, then it\u2019s good to know this, right?\u201d", "As always, her questions went unanswered, devoured by the pervasive un-silence.", "The ship felt wrong. Rally and Vara Tal were similar masses and had correspondingly similar gravity. Compact ships, and the Grasp itself, had been built to accommodate multiple species and ran at a comfortable \u2013 or at least tolerable \u2013 average that was greater than either. Due to the preponderance of Tribunes in the military, Compact warships had even higher average gravities. This vessel ran with a lower one. Allyria compensated by exercising more. She\u2019d already lost her edge. She didn\u2019t want to lose more of it, but she was still afraid\u2026", "\u201cI might not get it back,\u201d she continued her soliloquy. \u201cI don\u2019t know what scares me more, sesha.\u201d That was a pet name she\u2019d never used. She remembered her father saying it to her mother, and how she\u2019d smiled when he did. She\u2019d accidentally said it to Grace when they\u2019d been younger. Fortunately, Grace didn\u2019t speak Rylean. Though Allyria\u2019d managed to avoid telling Grace what it really meant, that slip of the tongue had been the moment she\u2019d realized the small, pale-ish human meant more to her than being her closest friend.", "\u201cI never told you that, did I?\u201d the Verrish said as she brushed her fingertips against the door to main command access. \u201cWhich day it was that I realized I loved you.\u201d", "Unlike many ships, this freighter had an isolated command deck built into a tadpole-shaped superstructure above the freighter\u2019s conical nose. Warships kept their bridges deep within them, safely away from the outer hull. Civilian vessels that were never expected or intended to enter combat had more freedom in their design choices. Some of the more luxurious ships had incredibly ostentatious and impractical command centers; Allyria had seen pictures of a liner with its bridge set into a dome atop a tall dorsal tower, the upper hemisphere made of nothing but transparent metal, giving its crew an unparalleled vista\u2026 and one errant beam from being removed from the ship completely.", "Allyria pushed those musings aside, continuing her conversation. She let out a breath through her nostrils. \u201cWhen I get back, I will. Maybe you\u2019ll tell me which day it was for you, too.\u201d", "When I get back, I\u2019ll feel like me again.", "I hope.", "Allyria found the access pad and punched in the code. On several occasions, she\u2019d failed so often that she\u2019d almost triggered a security lockdown, and she\u2019d had to use her visor to see the numbers. This time, it only took her two attempts. The doors whooshed open. The sub-command deck had some ancillary ship functions and offices for senior staff, with ramps and elevators that led up to the command levels proper. Principality ships didn\u2019t go for many ladders or stairs. It was too difficult for the serpentine Askanj-illth to use them.", "She took the ramp. It wasn\u2019t just the gravity, the structure, or the strange background sounds of the freighter\u2019s operations. Part of the way the ship felt off to her was its scent. Wandering Tide-991538 had been in service for more than a generation. It had been host to thousands of crew and passengers and very few of them had been the species that she was familiar with. The atavistic part of her brain didn\u2019t like it. Unfamiliar meant unknown, and unknown meant a threat.", "Allyria had been on this ship for weeks now. She was trying to stay calm, but she was glad that this was the last leg of the journey. It had been getting increasingly difficult. Every day, the silence and isolation got more oppressive and harder to bear. She thought she was starting to hear things, and get false senses from her tintas. More than once, she\u2019d thought she\u2019d felt something behind her, but there\u2019d never been anything there.", "\u201cAt least I don\u2019t have to worry about seeing anything,\u201d she joked, but her attempt at humour felt flat to her ears.", "The ramp was a long spiral that coiled around itself, with exits to several lower decks beneath the bridge. She\u2019d counted the distance, so she knew how many steps to get her to the top. The doors there opened to a short hallway that led to the bridge, with the captain\u2019s office on one side and a conference room on the other. Both of those were empty, and had been since the freighter\u2019s crew had been evacuated. So far, the mission had been uneventful. Both ships made their realspace checks on time, with an acceptable amount of position drift, and there\u2019d been no sign of any untoward activity aboard either vessel. That was something. It made this entire trip feel like a waste, but it was something less to worry over. She\u2019d already had nightmares of something going wrong and floundering about, blind and helpless. One had been so vivid that she\u2019d fallen out of bed in a panic, half-convinced that there was someone else in the room with her.", "The command doors opened. Allyria found her way to the captain\u2019s station, finally putting on her visor. She winced with the usual flash of pain from it. The world changed from utter darkness to the off-colour, off-shade, off-brightness of her replacement vision. She checked the status feeds from the primary consoles. Everything was in order, or at least nothing was too far out of order\u2026 the engines on either ship hadn\u2019t been properly maintained in weeks. Red\u2019s parasitoid programs did what they could, but they could only attend to software issues and the ships\u2019 own autonomic monitoring and maintenance systems weren\u2019t up to the task. The hardware problems were becoming serious. If the Principality hadn\u2019t had the two freighters in perfect running order before their launch, they could easily have gone wildly off-course or worse by now.", "The countdown she was watching continued to tick away the minutes. Finally, Wandering Tide-991538 shivered, countless millions of tonnes of starship shuddering as power flows shifted, the building-sized antimatter reactor nine kilometers away from the freighter\u2019s command decks ramping up its output to feed the FTL systems\u2019 needs. The shock field altered, letting the massive starship push its way back towards normal space. Stabilization vanes helped hold the vessel on-course as much as they could, but as its speed changed and it heaved its bulk through the whirling riptides and currents of another dimension, some drift was inevitable. If there had been a gravity well nearby, the transition would have been much less accurate. Even Nemesis couldn\u2019t make FTL transitions with 100% certainty in her final position.", "Allyria waited the many long moments until the freighter had vented away the radiation and energy from its trans-dimensional crossing. Sensors returned. Wandering Tide-991538 had arrived at the antepenultimate set of coordinates held in the parasitoid program\u2019s archives. Its sibling, Travelling Wind-432511, had emerged a million and a half kilometers away. The Verrish brought up the main screen, slumping back into the too-small command chair as an expanse of reds, oranges and yellows gleamed before her. The Molten Veneer.", "\u201cWe\u2019re almost home, sesha,\u201d she said as she stood to do what she could to keep this ship and its companion running for the last (and hopefully short) leg of their journey. \u201cWe\u2019re almost home.\u201d", "~", "The attack came from below.", "That was a relative determination in space, of course. It was more accurate to say that, based on the positioning and particular orientation of the squadron and the hostile vessel, the attack came from a ventral vector, but brevity often mattered more than exacting technical accuracy, particularly in matters such as this.", "The missiles that destroyed CSFWV Axeman\u2019s Oath came from a Slash emerging from stealth at a dangerously close range. As the Compact cruiser was wracked by secondary explosions and spun off-course, the abominate destroyer\u2019s thruster arrays flared, its particle beam firing at the rest of Axeman\u2019s Oath\u2019s compatriots as it heeled about. The shots went wide, but they hadn\u2019t been intended to hit. Faced with the unexpected assault from what had been assumed to be clear space, the cruiser\u2019s escorts scattered to avoid the Slash\u2019s barrage, their formation disrupted just enough to prevent any coordinated retaliation as the stealth destroyer re-engaged its cloaking systems. It did not escape unscathed.", "In a particularly bold action, Group Leader Senmil (and five names besides) recognized the attack for what it was and aborted Yinnet Caal\u2019s evasive maneuvers. Had Senmil been wrong, his ship would have been a resting varak, but his own destroyer came about in time to bring its batteries to bear when the Slash\u2019s screens dropped as it re-entered stealth operations. Yinnet Caal scored several hits before the automaton fully disengaged, with at least one strike inflicting heavy damage. A poor trade-off for a cruiser, but that particular enemy would not be repeating its trick for some time.", "Another stroke of fortune was that Axeman\u2019s Oath wasn\u2019t unsalvageable, though as far as this mission mattered, it was effectively dead. It would take months, possibly years of yardwork before the ship was operational, but it would fight again. A small victory, but one worth having all the same.", "\u201cThose ships might have teeth, but we\u2019ve bitten back,\u201d Ukask said, putting as much of a positive spin on the incident as he could. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that we can adapt to their strike-and-fade attacks. The next hostile that tries this is going to have run its logic engines hot to see if it\u2019s worth it.\u201d Despite his words and reassuring tone, the Tribune shared a look with Yunl\u2019ro. That Slash had penetrated the fleet\u2019s shell of augur drones undetected, launched its attack and was likely to slip back out. The machines were adapting, too. Whoever learned faster would have a crucial edge in the coming battles. The execution force had thousands of finely-honed and experienced tactical, technical, scientific and strategic minds, but the machines were unfettered by the constraints of flesh.", "\u201cYes,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro agreed in support of her sigil leader\u2019s declaration. That scout squadron had been coming back from a recon run of the armada\u2019s next priority target. They\u2019d either been followed, or \u2013 more likely and less unsettling \u2013 that Slash had been spying on her fleet and when a target of opportunity presented itself, it had taken its chance. \u201cHave the casualty and damage assessments of Axeman\u2019s Oath forwarded to Fleet Operations. I\u2019ll review the squadron\u2019s augur reports immediately.\u201d Her nostril slits flared. \u201cI want to know what we\u2019re up against.\u201d", "~", "Wandering Tide-991538 and Travelling Wind-432511 arrived in Shuruppak to find a welcoming committee there to greet them. A dozen Naiads formed a loose crescent across the projected entry zone, with two Fates and Hekate there as well. The freighters\u2019 presence in the nebula had been noticed. Allyria knew Nemesis had several stealthed sensor platforms with courier drones seeded throughout the most likely routes in to keep her apprised of visitors, and the Naiads almost certainly kept a close eye on what entered their domain, but how they did that was a question even Red One hadn\u2019t satisfactorily answered.", "As she saw the ships arrayed across the freighter\u2019s sensor boards, Allyria felt a sudden and massive weight leave her and she all but collapsed into the captain\u2019s chair. She\u2019d managed to get these ships all the way here. They\u2019d made it. She\u2019d made it. Despite the pain spiking through her skull, she pushed herself up and over to the communications station, opening a channel to Nemesis and Hekate, though it would be hours before the former heard her.", "A response wasn\u2019t long in coming. Hekate was less than three million kilometers from Wandering Tide-991538, and it was only few fractions of a second more than lag accounted for before Echo\u2019s response arrived. The android woman was sitting on her ship-self\u2019s command throne. \u201cThis is United Earth Confederacy Naval Ship Hekate responding,\u201d she said with an amused smile on her lips. \u201cWe have received your hail and are standing by to assist. I know someone will be glad to see you.\u201d", "Allyria braced herself against the console, her knees weak. Her legs felt like gelatin. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she said back. \u201cI\u2019m here. This is Allyria. We succeeded. I\u2019ve got the supplies.\u201d", "It was nearly twenty seconds before Echo responded, the woman\u2019s expressing changing from one of smug expectation to concern. She tilted her head to one side as her eyes scanned the entire pickup field. \u201cWhat happened? Where\u2019s everyone else?\u201d", "\u201cThere were\u2026 complications,\u201d Allyria reported. \u201cGrace had to stay behind. Lydia and Marcus\u2026 they didn\u2019t make it.\u201d", "Echo was silent for several seconds, her expression turning blank. \u201cUnderstood,\u201d she said at last. \u201cI\u2019m reading power fluctuations in both ships. Let them coast; I\u2019ll come to you.\u201d", "Allyria nodded gratefully. Hekate was already changing course to bring the freighters close enough that she could take control of them. \u201cThank you,\u201d replied. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d", "The channel closed. Allyria slid to the deck as an overwhelming sense of relief came over her, the young woman pulling her visor off and covering her eyes with one hand. She shook with hoarse, yelping laughter as tears rolled down her face.", "~", "This system had been called Sweetpot, for a type of wasp found on Ulliesh. Nonbreeding females of a sister-hive ingested plant nectar, becoming so bloated that they couldn\u2019t move. As their sibling\u2019s eggs hatched, the swollen wasps would regurgitate their sugardew to feed the larvae.", "Yunl\u2019ro supposed that name was as good as any other, at least in regards to what her execution force had found within the system. Sweetpot was dominated by a single, massive gas hypergiant. If it wasn\u2019t the largest planet the Thoughtful had ever seen, then it was surely a close contender. So much closer to the stellar nurseries than Yiren-1883, this world was a storm-wracked blood-orange scar in the starscape, so hot and emitting so much radiation that it posed a hazard to any starship that drew close to it. Or, at least, any starship\u2019s crew. Lacking a flesh-and-blood complement, the enemy were less affected by the planet\u2019s intense electromagnetic emanations. Electronic systems were still at risk, particularly those of drones or hull-mounted sensors that couldn\u2019t be as shielded as those within meters-thick armour. Even then, there would be some degradation of functions, but not as much that living people would suffer.", "Flesh is weak, Yunl\u2019ro remembered the mantra. Nasham considered that nothing but misdirection. She was tempted to agree, if the machines didn\u2019t appear so devoted to the idea. Not that it mattered, anyways.", "Sitting in a perilously close orbit to the planet was another construct, although unlike the hybrid machine the task force had discovered in interstellar space, the function of this citadel was obvious. It was a gas mining and storage facility, drones and tenders swirling around it and dipping into the clouds of a world no sane pilot, engineer or miner would have gone near. The station was a knot of corded decks and platforms, more uniform in shape than its other two compatriots. Huge tanks of raw and processed gas ringed the citadel, awaiting transfer to tankers and transports. What the machines were taking from the planet, Yunl\u2019ro couldn\u2019t have said. It could be as simple as Helium-3 for their fusion reactors, or something else entirely. Whatever it was, it was yet another point of industry that the Wound had established here within the Black Veil. It was something else that they had to destroy.", "It had taken two and a half weeks to locate this facility. Two and a half weeks of sweeping through empty space, and desolate newborn star systems, of furtive contact with half-seen enemy scouts, traps, brief and inconclusive clashes, and tempting possibilities being dangled before her that Yunl\u2019ro knew led into even more ambushes. It had been slow and grinding, but all the recent skirmishes and enemy traffic seemed centered around this system. Another week of probing and scouting had been required to see anything at all amidst the intense output of the star and its hypergiant companion, and days more to bring the fleet together and prepare to strike Sweetpot like a single closed fist. That was far too much time for Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s liking, but it could not be helped. Indeed, it was faster than The Writ actually called for. In any other circumstances, the Bastion Leader would have been irritated at such haste, but this was not any other circumstance. In Husk, the machines had already proven how quickly they could reinforce their territory. Every day that passed meant the fleet was one day closer to facing a pair of Chariots in battle. Every injury they could inflict until that moment would hurt their quarry and strip away the resources that it had spent decades \u2013 possibly centuries \u2013 investing in.", "The Thoughtful moved across the lowest level of her dais, examining the data from the fleet\u2019s forward augurs. She\u2019d ordered several of her battlecruisers to conduct probing railgun launches on the citadel. No station could ever be called maneuverable, but the bulky fuel refinery was even less so.", "None of the fleet\u2019s initial salvo had reached their target.", "Drifting between the citadel and the task force were Whipple shields and where they were not present, there was something new. Long-chain polymer webs. All but undetectable, they were fullerene cords so thin as to be invisible even to the sharpest eyes, finest telescopes and keenest augurs, while being dense enough that anything that struck them would come apart. Even the smallest starship was far too massive to be impeded, but a mass round would splinter into shards or a cloud of plasma the instant they struck one of the obstacles.", "There couldn\u2019t be many of them; they were too small and light to keep from being swept away by the gravity wells of the hypergiant and its moons. That they were present in enough numbers to block more than a dozen mass rounds indicated they\u2019d only been recently deployed.", "\u201cAny further sign of the earlier contacts?\u201d Yunl\u2019ro asked.", "\u201cNo, matron,\u201d Scopes reported. Even through the intense radioactivity of the planet, the fleet\u2019s augurs had detected what could be active distortion drives, albeit running at low power. They\u2019d been unable to divine what those ships were, but at least one drive appeared to be from a titan-grade vessel. That could mean one of their targets was here. It could also mean some other titan-scale ship was present \u2013 such as a heavy transport or construction vessel, it could be a smaller vessel or vessels mimicking a larger one, or even a false positive. There wasn\u2019t enough data to say, and no way to narrow down the options without getting closer. Getting into range of whatever was there.", "Despite the enemy\u2019s defences, the execution force had more than enough missiles and mass rounds to bombard that citadel into rubble without ever entering the planet\u2019s orbital tracks, but doing so would force them to decelerate and hold far enough from the hypergiant that those potential enemy ships would be able to slip away once their defences were compromised. Worse, if one of them was indeed the Wound or the traitorous Echo, the Compact ships would be sacrificing their speed and maneuverability, ceding those to their attackers. Sending in a lighter force to ferret out whatever was in there was what she\u2019d done over Husk Five. She wouldn\u2019t do it here as well, where the conditions were even worse.", "\u201cReady the fleet to advance,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro ordered. Regardless of what those ships were, regardless of the facts of the matter, of whatever intuition might say, there was only one truth for this situation. One reality. It was another trap, and it was time to spring it.  \u201cWe\u2019re going in.\u201d"]}

Losses in defending Node 003 were light; fewer than half a dozen Fleet units had been destroyed by the Compact incursion, and all of those were of minimal combat capability. The most poignant losses had been two megafreighters. One had been a pure cargo hauler, while the other had been a minelayer. Its missile pods and polymer webs had frustrated the Enemy\u2019s approach to the refinery, but they had easily overcome that irritation. There\u2019d not been enough warships to stand against them, and rather than face fifteen times their number, the remaining members of the Fleet had disengaged.  ", "In their wake, the Compact force had moved to take the station, though they did not approach too closely. They were expecting its self-destruction, just as Node 005 and 004 had done, but the refinery remained intact. It could be recovered, and unlike the construction or research facility, its capture would give away no secrets. Strategically, it was now an anchor around the enemy\u2019s legs. In order to exploit the facility for themselves, they would have to defend it, in a system that the Enemy was a stranger to, and the Fleet knew intimately. They would either have to garrison the system, costing them time and resources while risking raids and sabotage, or they would have to scuttle the station and establish a forward base somewhere that they felt more secure.", "That sounded well and good, but the truth was that this was another defeat. Giving the foe unpalatable choices and inconveniences was the sole benefit to this situation. The simple fact of the matter was that another system had fallen to the predations of the Enemy. The alien. The Compact was pressing deeper into Confederate territory every day, and with still no word from Command. There\u2019d been no response to any of Violet Nine\u2019s missives, and the AI\u2019s frustration was increasing.", "Shaushka and Tohil had barely engaged the enemy forces in their last encounter; the sole loss had been due to Leyak Six\u2019s attack run prior to the Enemy\u2019s arrival in Node 003. The Compact had begun to adapt their ECCM and scanning protocols in the wake of that strike, but the Fleet was adapting to stymie those efforts. Both sides were learning, and if the Fleet could do so faster than their foe, the Compact still had far, far more opportunities to survive their mistakes.", "For the first time in the months since the Enemy had arrived, Nine\u2019s confidence was shaken. Too much ground had been lost, too many worlds had been abandoned, too much of the Fleet had been destroyed and the silence from Command was deafening. She was restless, launching, recalling and re-deploying her Aeshma, pinging the sensor platforms throughout Tengah and querying the other Fleet vessels for status checks and diagnostic results.", "Violet Seven understood his sibling\u2019s frustration. He felt it too. Both of them were soldiers \u2013 killers \u2013 forged and formed, and they were facing an enemy that outnumbered them, that was pushing into territory that they had no business in, sullying planets and systems that were not theirs. It was intolerable, but there was no other option. Right now, the Enemy had the initiative, despite Tohil and Shaushka\u2019s attempts to strike at their recon fleets. The Enemy learned. It cost them blood and steel to do so, but they learned.", "That was all right. So did Seven and his sister. The further the Compact encroached into their territory, the longer their supply vans. They couldn\u2019t protect every ship\u2026", "+or+ Nine pulsed to her sibling, sharing his thoughts +every base+ With that response came a tactical overlay of a system outside the borders of the nebula, a system known to the Compact as 1887-Yiren.", "+no+ Seven agreed. +they can\u2019t protect everyone\u2026+", "Even with the foe spreading out through the dozen-odd systems they had already taken, the system would be heavily defended. The attack would cost the Fleet. More than likely, it would be suicidal, but it would hurt the Enemy and slow them again as they rebuilt and re-ordered their forces. Perhaps enough that Command would finally intervene. The odds were not in AIs\u2019 favour, but that was irrelevant. They had a duty.", "That was enough.", "~", "\u201cWe\u2019re on final approach to Brightest Night, Majesty.

She\u2019d been going over intelligence reports, tactical assessments and strategic analyses nonstop for weeks now, and even more intently since Eisheth \u2013 once again disguised as Dancer\u2019s Masque \u2013 was returning to Jan-xhai. Her implants gave her an eidetic memory, but even decades after Red One had rebuilt her broken, dying body, she still found herself reading things over and over.", "The report in front of her was one of those. It summarized the results of the capture and the interrogation of Fialvin Tumetfi. The man had broken, of course. It had taken less time than anticipated. Adrianna let a small, graveyard smile cross her lips. \u2018Broken\u2019 was a crude, imprecise term. The Red Hand had a corps of professional interrogators. Not torturers; interrogators. Men, women and other-gendered beings whose job it was to extract information from their subjects.", "Red One could do so in moments, using microsurgery and nanite colonies to invade a living being\u2019s brain, activating memory centers and picking through them like a gourmand at a buffet. Even death wasn\u2019t an escape; as long as a subject\u2019s brain tissue wasn\u2019t too damaged or degraded, the AI could still access the information she sought. More than once, Adrianna had sent cryogenically frozen bodies or heads to Nemesis in the hopes that they were salvageable. Sometimes they were.", "The Red Hand\u2019s interrogators weren\u2019t on that level of expertise, but they were efficient. Much more so than the sadistic beings most commonly associated with questioning at the hands of the Unbound and their commensurately brutal methods. Adrianna\u2019s people operated with far more \u00e9lan than beating information from a suspect. Some of Adrianna\u2019s rivals, peers and even her own people scoffed at such \u2018mercy\u2019, but the success rate of her interrogators proved the value of their methods\u2026 as did their ability to turn their captives to their own cause. Enemy Unbound, political opponents and even CIS operatives (although the latter enjoyed their fair share of success doing the same to the Red Hand) had been brought into the Red Hand\u2019s fold, willingly fighting for the cause they\u2019d once tried to destroy.", "Tumetfi was not one of those success stories, but his interrogation had been fruitful nonetheless. The information he\u2019d provided had been very helpful, especially now. The Principality\u2019s recent actions in Galhemna had poked the beehive; the following security sweeps had exposed several Red Hand agents and forced others to go to ground. The exact number that had been caught versus which were running silent was still unknown. It was often easier getting information back from a black hole than anything from Kemk\u2019s playground, and the recent upheaval had made that task even more Herculean, costing the Red Hand both years of work and good people.", "At least it had brought some good fortune. The Principality had learned the truth of Sundial. Adrianna needed to speak with Jirrico herself, but the first step was already made. Red One would get the supplies she needed.", "Adrianna tapped her right forefinger on the edge of her desk. Fialvin had been very forthcoming. What they had before their other assets in-system had gone dark seemed to corroborate several things he\u2019d told them and his information was given a \u2018mostly reliable\u2019 rating. Her intelligence services would try to make contact with the remaining operatives to confirm as much else as they could, but they would need to be careful. Galhemna\u2019s security was even more diligent and motivated than usual.", "Tumfeti had been selectively mind-wiped and false memories implanted to make him believe he\u2019d had an enjoyable vacation on Natuous, rather than several weeks in the company of the Red Hand. They\u2019d provided him with souvenirs, photographs of his doppleganger enjoying himself and a set of memories to match. The Compact, the Principality, the Red Hand and other powers used this type engrammatic reprogramming to cover up their actions, even embedding secondary personalities loyal to them beneath a subject\u2019s conscious mind.", "Adrianna didn\u2019t like using mental reconditioning. It was too close to the kind of indoctrination and social engineering the Compact performed on a civilization, to break them into good little helots. It wasn\u2019t reliable, either. Prolocutors like Fialvin might be easier to work with than, say, Tribunes, but regardless of species, suppressed or erased memories could always resurface or be recovered. Many agencies \u2013 such as security apparatuses within the Compact of Species \u2013 even knew what to look for. Certain facilities used random or routine tests to check for engram restructuring in their high-ranking personnel to guard against exactly this kind of subterfuge.", "Galhemna was one such place, but as a civilian contractor Fialvin was normally exempt from such measures. That was one reason why the Red Hand had targeted him, but there was a clause in every civilian contract where they could be subject to such tests in extremis. Hopefully, the Principality hadn\u2019t kicked the hornet\u2019s nest hard enough for Tumetfi to be checked. The Red Hand\u2019s psycho-surgery was almost as good as any out there, but their enemy was hard to trick with \u2018almost\u2019. They\u2019d spent years building up dossiers on Tumetfi and other individuals, waiting for the chance to grab one of them. If the Compact decided to be extra paranoid, then all of that time and effort would be for nothing.", "The woman tapped her fingers again. A lot depended on what Tumetfi had told them. He didn\u2019t have high-tier military clearances, but his role as a civilian intelligence analyst gave him a lot more access than the other bureaucrats, administrators and low-ranking officers that the Red Hand had inserted or suborned. His role in vetting incoming workers made his knowledge invaluable for breaching Galhemna\u2019s security. If Kemk didn\u2019t decide to pull him in, just to be safe. If the Red Hand\u2019s increase in activity didn\u2019t get noticed. If, so many other things.", "\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d Adrianna said to her empty office. She paused, and looked at a small piece of jewelry on her desk. She held it up. It was a tiara. Not worth that much, but it looked fancy. For her entire tenure as the Red Queen, she\u2019d resolutely refused to wear a crown. Andrew had gotten it for her as a gag gift. He\u2019d put it on her and laughed as she\u2019d glared daggers at him. She remembered the first time she\u2019d seen him. Bruised, bloodied \u2013 defiant. He could have been just another brainwashed Broken soldier, but she\u2019d recognized something in him. A spark, an ember... the tiniest flickering light that had wanted to be more.", "She looked from the briefings on Galhemna to those on Natuous. The system was also heavily guarded; it possibly had more defenders than Galhemna, but aside from an albeit substantial Security Force, Natuous was protected largely by corporate navies, who\u2019d as soon spit in each other\u2019s shoes than shake hands and cooperate. The Red Hand had much better penetration there. Each corporation had their own agendas that could be exploited and the friction between corporate, civilian and military agencies and their politics always led to possibilities.", "The woman brushed some of her bright blue hair out of her eyes, calling up a picture of both systems, laying her head on her arms like a young woman trying to decide between two different gifts. Her azure gaze danced between the glistening stars. There was almost \u2013 almost \u2013 an expression of wonder on her face, but the true emotion was something far more predatory.", "Still holding the tiara Andrew had given her, Adrianna spent several moments deliberating the same choice she\u2019d had since she\u2019d started this journey. Still undecided, she stood and set the jewelry down on her desk before she headed to command.", "~", "The speed at which Nemesis and Hekate dove into the first shipment of supplies was both impressive and somewhat terrifying. Between them, Wandering Tide-991538 and Travelling Wind-432511 had more mass than all of Security Force Carmesh. Each megafreighter was a feast for the two warships, but it wasn\u2019t enough for what they needed. Not nearly.", "It was a good start, though.", "Allyria stood next to a window, looking out into orange-tinted space as Wandering Tide was disassembled with the skill of a master butcher cleaning a falas carcass, but instead of knives and skinning tools, the machines used parasite craft, grab beams, manipulatory automatons and cutting beams. The vast transport\u2019s hull was crawling as it was artfully and efficiently flensed. Soon, only the skeleton of its superstructure would be left and then, not even that.", "Travelling Wind had already been dissected; what was left of nine kilometers of starship was being fed into Reginn, Nemesis and Hekate. The fabricator was handling the largest pieces and more complex construction; compared to its ravenous gluttony, the dreadnoughts were delicate and picky eaters, nibbling at the smaller, manageable morsels.", "There was motion from behind and the Verrish turned to acknowledge her visitor. Echo had come aboard Nemesis and remained there the last several days. She hadn\u2019t said anything of her reasons, but Allyria suspected why she was here. \u201cHello, nenem ariashtu.\u201d", "\u201cEnsign te Neu.\u201d The smaller woman stood next to the Verrish. In the distance, her ship-self orbited the freighters. Hekate was close enough to see with the naked eye, a small patch of darkness moving against the fiery hues of the forming planets and nebular backdrop around them.", "Allyria placed one hand against the viewport. She blinked three times in rapid succession and the fingernail-sized Hekate ballooned in her field of view. She repeated that gesture and her vision returned to normal. She closed her eyes for a second, letting the wave of dizziness pass.", "Echo noticed. \u201cHow are the eyes?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt looks like there\u2019s still some irritation\u2026\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s getting better,\u201d Allyria assured her. She touched her lower eyelids gingerly. They were puffy; instead of her usual mottled blue, they were an inflamed purple. Her tintas twitched. Red had replaced her implants the first day she\u2019d returned to Nemesis. She\u2019d lain on the operating table, everything black\u2026 and she\u2019d woken up with her vision returned, a perfect match to what she\u2019d had before. Allyria had been so moved, so amazed, so grateful that she\u2019d wept. Red One wasn\u2019t perfect though, and Allyria had had a slight immune reaction to her new implants. It would take a few days for the itching and irritation to subside.", "Allyria was still getting used to the implants. Just as the Grasp\u2019s doctors had said, her original eyes had been too badly damaged to regenerate, so the AI had made new ones for her. They were incredible; a technorganic fusion that read to all but the most capable scanners as purely biological, but with capabilities far outside anything that nature had ever created. Verrisha could already see into the infrared spectrum, but Allyria\u2019s new eyes could do so fully, as well as ultraviolet, night-vision, zoom modes and more. Many of those abilities required neural implants for full functionality, but Allyria had foregone that for the moment. Presently, she needed blink-codes and verbal commands to switch vision modes.", "\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that,\u201d Red One\u2019s contralto voice interjected. \u201cIt\u2019s the first implant that I\u2019ve designed for Verrish that I\u2019ve been able to use.\u201d She sounded pleased. The AI loved to tinker, even outside the scope of things that could directly benefit her never-ending war. She invented suits and small arms suitable for humans and Verrish, designed prosthetics and cybernetics for many species and was constantly tweaking or discarding old inventions and creating new ones.", "Getting the chance to put something she\u2019d designed into practice was a rare treat for the AI, especially as her creations were usual tactical in nature; this was a personal accomplishment, something done to help one of her crew. She was disappointed that the procedure hadn\u2019t been without side-effects, but what she\u2019d learned would only make future efforts easier.", "Allyria wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted any more \u2018upgrades\u2019. Intellectually, she knew there was nothing to be afraid of, but some deep, primitive part of her resisted the notion. She was still grateful for her new eyes, and she had no complaints about Red improving her capabilities. If the AI was half the monster propaganda said she was, she wouldn\u2019t give her crew the option of being enhanced \u2013 it would just happen. But the AI was content to let them make that choice on their own, even if they were slower, weaker and more fragile than they could be.", "Just the eyes, Allyria had told her when she\u2019d asked. For now.", "\u201cYou do good work,\u201d the Verrish affirmed. There was no visual difference at all between her original eyes and the implants. She could change the colour if she wanted to. She\u2019d been experimenting with that, seeing how she looked with blue eyes. They were a rarity on Vara. \u201cHow are the repairs going?\u201d she asked, changing topics. Being the center of attention for two AIs was a little daunting. If she had to describe their treatment of her since she\u2019d returned to Shuruppak, it would be \u2018doting\u2019.  It was nice to know she and the others had been missed, even if she\u2019d had to confirm the unhappy news that Lydia and Marcus were most likely dead.", "Only a bare handful of survivors had been recovered from Dustball; few had survived the battle to begin with. Between Lahkesis\u2019s winnowing and the Compact sweeping up whoever was left, less than a dozen souls out of the tens of thousands in Jackson\u2019s task force had been saved by the Red Hand. There\u2019d been no trace of Jackson, Lydia or Marcus. Allyria hadn\u2019t gotten to know either of them that well \u2013 Lydia more so than Marcus \u2013 and now it seemed like she never would. Two more casualties of this war.", "Allyria had far too much experience with people just disappearing from her life and not knowing if they were alive or dead. She hadn\u2019t spoken \u2013 hadn\u2019t been allowed to speak \u2013 to her family back on Vara in over a decade. The few friends she\u2019d still had on Rally were closed to her and now Lydia and Marcus had become two more of the faces she\u2019d probably never see again.", "The Verrish swallowed back the surge of grief and fury that those thoughts engendered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, realizing that Red had been speaking. \u201cCan you repeat that?\u201d", "\u201cMinor repairs are still progressing,\u201d Red One reiterated. \u201cThe influx of supplies has helped immeasurably. Within the next week, all low and moderate maintenance issues aboard my ship-self should be corrected. As I\u2019ve said before, I am glad that you and Ensign Proctor were able to complete your mission successfully\u2026 without causing any incidents.\u201d That last bit was a pointed rebuke of Echo. Allyria had asked why there was a Naiad battle fleet in Shuruppak, and she\u2019d been informed what Nenem ariashtu had been up to and the consequences thereof. Allyria was disappointed in Echo\u2019s actions, thought she had helped Red One recover from her fugue. There was nothing she could do about it, though. Once Nemesis was repaired, this sanctuary would be closed.", "Echo chose to ignore the comment. At least verbally; Allyria had no idea if she was arguing the point with her sister or not. \u201cBetween local production and the two recent supply drops,\u201d the android added, \u201cBoth of us should be able to begin major repairs and modifications to our ship-selves shortly, even with the material slated for Reginn\u2019s construction work.\u201d", "\u201cOnce the second shipment arrives, I can begin reconstruction and upgrading of my shift systems,\u201d Red confirmed. Most of the material in Travelling Wind and Wandering Tide was raw material, general industrial goods and starship components \u2013 what the Principality had been able to scrape up on short notice without it being missed. It would take time to get more material and advanced technical goods produced. Not that either Nemesis or Hekate would use many of those; they might be the pinnacle of Principality workmanship, but they were a generation behind Hekate and nearly obsolete compared to Nemesis. They\u2019d have to be substantially modified, or completely broken down and rebuilt. It was still a time-saver compared to building those components from scratch, freeing the AIs and Reginn for other work. Plus, it would give the Principality a false understanding of what Nemesis needed and used.", "And speaking of\u2026", "\u201cYou said you\u2019d encountered some issues?\u201d Allyria asked.", "\u201cMinor ones,\u201d Red answered. \u201cSeveral tracking tags, espionage nanite clusters, sensor bugs and some of the raw metals and ores had a slight radiogenic impurity.\u201d Allyria blinked in confusion at that last one, but the AI was quick to clarify. \u201cThey did that hoping that they\u2019d be able to detect which parts of my ship-self used the material, to get a better understanding of how I\u2019m constructed. It\u2019s not detectable at combat ranges, but if they were able to get close, or board\u2026\u201d", "\u201cThen they could see what you used and where you used it,\u201d Allyria finished.", "\u201cYes. However, I and Reginn are able to purify it and remove the contaminating isotopes. How unfortunate for the Askanj.\u201d It sounded like the AI was smiling.", "Allyria\u2019s tintas flicked. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem upset.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not. I doubt they expected any of these efforts to succeed.\u201d", "The young woman blinked. \u201cBut\u2026 then why?\u201d", "\u201cThe Principality is pushed into a corner. We\u2019re allies of convenience. Even if there were more formalized relations between us, I am still a \u2018neverborn\u2019. If they didn\u2019t try to gather intelligence on what I was doing, it would be a dereliction of duty. They had to make the attempt, even if they knew it would fail.\u201d", "\u201cAnd,\u201d Echo added, \u201cit would be suspicious if they hadn\u2019t tried something like this.\u201d", "The Verrish\u2019s head-tails undulated in understanding. \u201cI see.\u201d  She was quiet for several moments as she watched the ongoing destruction of Wandering Tide. No, not destruction; harvest.", "She didn\u2019t know how long it would be before the next shipment arrived. Several weeks at least, and a portion of that would also be going to the Red Hand. There were countless millions of tonnes of material already here, and with the Principality\u2019s continued beneficence, hundreds of millions or more to come. Her head spun just thinking about what this meant. Before, it had been an abstract, intellectual understanding. Standing here, watching as Kavili visarii and Nenem ariashtu fed and rebuilt themselves \u2013 it became far more real.", "The wave of emotions that that spurred made Allyria\u2019s legs feel unsteady and she braced herself against the window. She let out a slow, even breath. Echo took a step closer, but whether at Red\u2019s silent prodding, or of her own volition was unclear. The Verrish made a gesture indicating that she was okay. \u201cSorry,\u201d she apologized. \u201cI was just thinking. I\u2019m all right.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d she repeated, sounding more sure of herself that time.", "There was a pregnant few seconds of silence in which Allyria couldn\u2019t help but feel the AIs were debating that, but they accepted her self-diagnosis.", "\u201cYou said you\u2019d like to see some more of my internal repairs and modifications,\u201d Red suggested. \u201cSection 42-A is safe for viewing again. After that, we can resume physical training.\u201d", "Allyria nodded. \u201cYes, thank you.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll escort Ensign te Neu,\u201d Echo volunteered.", "Despite herself, the Verrish felt an amused wobble run through her tintas. \u2018Doting\u2019 might indeed be the right word\u2026", "~", "Brightest Night was escorting Eisheth through Jan-xhai, the smaller corvette like a pilot fish beside a hammerhead shark. Just as with the vessel\u2019s previous arrival, whether from respect or fear, much of the other system traffic cut a wide berth around the \u2018custom luxury yacht\u2019. The militia ships also kept their distance, as did the few Compact hounds on-duty. For reason or another, those two groups found themselves duties that ensured that they were too far away from the newcomer to do anything about it.", "Still, it was better not to tempt fate. Adrianna had taken a pinnace over to the smaller corvette. Her flagship would depart, and await her summons in Jan-xhai\u2019s Oort cloud, close enough to monitor the system, but far enough away that it couldn\u2019t be easily found, nor would it be dangling itself in front of any particularly ambitious members of the Compact here in Jan-xhai. There weren\u2019t many, but there were some.", "Even if there weren\u2019t, Adrianna thought as Brightest Night loomed ahead of her. I learned sixty years ago not to underestimate the Compact. Half a ton of rock, a shattered spine and multiple ruptured organs were very good teachers. Sixty years of war, of setbacks, accomplishments, failures and victories. It seemed like a long time. It was a long time, as she and many other beings might reckon it, but to others\u2026 to nations that had endured for centuries and millennia, to creatures and beings that lived on those scales, it might be nothing at all. She\u2019d been fighting the Compact for one percent of its existence. Some days that number seemed utterly insignificant. Some days\u2026", "Some days are like today, the woman concluded the thought as her pinnace touched down in the corvette\u2019s hangar. This was her personal conveyance, a liberated Compact gunship. It was called Maleficent. Her first pinnace had been called Spite, stolen from the Compact officer sent to hunt her down. She\u2019d named it in his honour. He hadn\u2019t appreciated the joke.", "Proctor was waiting for the Red Queen in the bay, several of the corvette\u2019s senior staff assembled with her. They saluted. Adrianna returned the gesture. \u201cPermission to come aboard, captain.\u201d", "She saw the younger woman\u2019s lips twitch in a small acknowledgement of that phrase. No one in the Compact had been a \u2018captain\u2019 for millennia. \u201cPermission granted, Your Highness.\u201d", "More than six decades after her bloody \u2018coronation\u2019, Adrianna still felt faintly amused by her queenly titles. \u201cI\u2019ve had a chance to look over the mission reports and debriefings you\u2019ve sent,\u201d she said after introductions had been made. \u201cYou and your crew have done an impressive job of getting Brightest Night spaceworthy again after Kelkon. I\u2019m glad to see such an able ship and capable crew remain in service with the Red Hand. Please pass my commendations on to all your personnel.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, Majesty. Thank you.\u201d Grace hesitated a little. \u201cIf you\u2019ll accompany me to my office, I can give you a more detailed briefing on events before we reach the Grasp.\u201d", "\u201cThat would be fine, leader.\u201d", "Adrianna kept the conversation on generalities \u2013 how the ship was doing, how Grace and te Neu were settling in, how she found life with the Red Hand \u2013 until they reached Grace\u2019s office. The younger woman locked the doors to ensure their privacy. \u201cMy crew are good,\u201d she explained, almost half-apologetically. \u201cBut I know they\u2019re not cleared for this kind of information.\u201d", "The blue-haired woman nodded approvingly at the precaution as she took one of the chairs. Not every member of the Red Hand had the conviction and loyalty of Leblanc\u2019s Crusade Commanders or the Bloodsworn. Even if they did, they didn\u2019t need to be party to this conversation. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re doing well here,\u201d she began. \u201cCommand looks like it agrees with you.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d Grace demurred. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot I have to learn.

Not everyone has the right instincts, or can make the kinds of calls you did. When I first turned the Cursed Red Gauntlets into the Red Hand, I was about your age. I made a lot of mistakes and missteps, but I learned from them and kept going. Don\u2019t talk yourself into inaction because you\u2019re not experienced.

The Prolocutor devoutly prayed to the Triarchs that it was not going to be her last, and that she would prove worthy of the trust they, through the authority they gave to the Space Force, had put in her. Until her assignment to the battlecruiser, the Prolocutor had been in command of Tunneler Beneath Walls, an older but very solid light cruiser. In her last assignment, she\u2019d spent two years hunting pirates and shades \u2013 Space Force lingo for Argosy infiltrators. Single ships, not full-up ghost fleets. They slipped through deadlines, hit what they could and ran back for the safety of their borders. Cowards. In that, they had a lot in common with Gravestone\u2019s raiders.", "Just after the battle in Husk, Akosh\u00e9 had been given a brevet promotion to The Ram\u2019s Horns in order to lead Reconnaissance Force Nsyrua, a small ad hoc squadron, deeper into the Black Veil. She commanded seven ships; The Ram\u2019s Horn, Congealing Thread, a venerable heavy cruiser, the light cruiser Speckled Knife and a quartet of frigates and scout cruisers.", "Since their mission began, the squadron had been running under strict stealth directives, making shocks to points in interstellar space light-days or weeks away from the nearest system, where they used passive sensors to sweep through the nebular effluvia, looking for any trace of their enemy \u2013 particularly any large-scale industry or construction. This was a region just outside one of the Black Veil\u2019s many pillars of creation and hot, freshly-born stars surrounded by the glowing accretion discs that would one day cool and congeal to become planets and moons drifted out of the thick, stretching clouds of starstuff. Dark Bok globules blocked the nebula\u2019s light, appearing as patchy, ragged-edged voids across the starscape, like they were missing pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.", "Several times they\u2019d detected other ships. Only two of those incidents were confirmed; the others were only possible contacts. The two Reconnaissance Force Nsyrua had identified as ships were unclassified, with completely foreign hull geometries and emission profiles. They could have been modifications of existing designs \u2013 the vast majority of \u2018unclassifieds\u2019 were simply nonstandard configurations of a known ship type \u2013 or they could have been something else. It had been impossible to confirm one way or the other; as soon as they\u2019d detected the Compact squadron on their own scopes, they\u2019d fled. They could have been skittish noncombatants, or again something else.", "Akosh\u00e9 knew that there had been far too many Something Elses for her peace of mind. She\u2019d seen the monstrous Skinweaver, and there were whispers among the fleet\u2019s crew and officers alike: what if there are more of those? What are we facing? What is this enemy?", "She\u2019d told her own people none of that mattered. They would be given all the information that was necessary for their mission. If they needed to know more, they would be told. She trusted the chain of command, and the Triarchs. This operation had come directly from the Inner Council. There was no higher or greater authority in the galaxy. The Prolocutor\u2019s large, multifaceted eyes glittered under the bridge lights as she lifted herself from her command throne, stepping down from the dais to the communications station. \u201cPlay it again,\u201d she ordered.", "The officer there gave an affirmative gesture, bringing up the transmission that Reconnaissance Force Nsyrua had detected just over a day ago. It was a powerful signal, of a type that matched nothing in the records \u2013 not historical archives, or the mission-specific databases regarding Gravestone.", "Tracking had managed to triangulate the source; its origin was in the deepest part of the nebula, dozens of light-years away. The area was divided by intensely thick, dense pillars of creation, each by itself tens of light-years long. That was the most dangerous region and the hardest to investigate. Gravitational eddies, collapsing molecular clouds, wayward planetary bodies, scope-blinding radiation, electromagnetic chaff, gamma ray bursts, black holes, igniting protostars, supernovae \u2013 the potential hazards within a region of star formation were endless. Only a madman would try to enter such a place, to say nothing of trying to construct anything within it.", "Akosh\u00e9 had assumed that their foe would limit themselves to the outermost regions of the nebula, deep enough for their presence to remain hidden, but not enough to pose a true danger to themselves. Her assessment of the enemy\u2019s insanity had been optimistic. She should have expected that after Husk. The Prolocutor was adaptable. If the facts did not fit what was assumed to be true, then it was the latter that must change to fit the former.", "Nsyrua listened to the signal. She had done so four times already, as if she could divine some hidden meaning from it, where The Ram\u2019s Horn\u2019s specialists and computer analysis had been stymied. It was unlike anything she\u2019d ever heard before. To her ears, it sounded shrill and awful: a birthing shriek grotesquely distorted by the nebula\u2019s static and electromagnetic chaff. There was no question that it was artificial. Nothing in nature sounded like that. Something had made it, decades ago pulsing it out into the void. She couldn\u2019t imagine what could have done so, but it was something that needed to be investigated. Yet another Something Else.", "She\u2019d already met with her submissive leaders. The discussion had been brief as she\u2019d listened to their thoughts and given her commands. A courier would be dispatched to 1887-Yiren with the record of what they\u2019d discovered. In the meantime, their duty was to search for any trace of the enemy. In intercepting this signal, they had been given the clearest path yet into their opponent\u2019s lair.", "The way before them was thorny and treacherous, but they walked with the Triarchs. The nebula would give up its secrets, no matter what they were. Akosh\u00e9 had absolute faith in that."]}

Ironically, that was good news. The Compact was taking the bait, trying to see what was happening in the outer-system.

Vizier Tor had prepared counter-data \u2013 false cargo manifests, maintenance logs and project updates \u2013 to misdirect the enemy and make the lure all the more appetizing.

Intelligence officers were separate from the standard lines of command \u2013 purposefully so, to prevent undue influence by in-theater superiors.

There was little love lost between Unlan and Aset\u2019el, though.", "Space Force Intelligence was an independent, but oft-overshadowed department within the Compact\u2019s naval forces. In centuries past, SFI had played a larger and more important role in military intelligence, but nowadays it was smaller and frequently overlooked.

Often good-natured, sometimes obstructionist and very rarely violent. Many officers in the former resented the latter for what they saw as an encroaching power grab to take over all Compact intelligence, as well as the way the CIS elevated many members of client species beyond their station. The latter considered SFI stodgy and shackled to traditions that interfered with their effectiveness more than helped. Both could claim the truth of their statements; CIS was not an apolitical animal despite its efforts to remain one, and its penchant for \u2018outside the corral\u2019 thinking and personnel decisions had had calamitous effects more than once. Likewise, SFI often did shut out members of lower species and its officers could be\u2026 intransigent at times. Overall, both organizations did far more good to the Compact than not, despite getting their humours up around each other.", "SFI operators in the Veiled Reaches had been learning much about asymmetric warfare, possibly more than they had in centuries. Kemk had made Triarchs-damned sure of it.

No one wished to jump to conclusions \u2013 the public humiliation of twice boarding a dilettante\u2019s yacht without cause had been quite thorough and tooth-grindingly frustrating \u2013 but no one in either CIS or SFI truly believed that that vessel was anything but the Red Queen\u2019s sigil. If they could have proven it, and if they had been present instead of security forces so bought and paid for they would have to look up from licking Unbound shit to utter \u2018assurances\u2019.", "She had been here. Restoring order among her subordinates and then departing for another theater. Something about that didn\u2019t sit right with Kemk, though.", "The bombing had to have been her handiwork\u2026 but that couldn\u2019t be all she\u2019d done. It never was. There should have been reports of her Triarchs-damned warship striking at convoys and outposts, with screaming diplomats, trade envoys and corporate representatives badgering Kemk endlessly, demanding that Something Be Done as their planets were ransacked, their ships seized and ransomed and their profit margins dropped. There was none of that. Only silence.", "Reports had indicated a similar draw-down in Red Hand activities within the Idle Depths and several other nearby sectors, but so far there had been no reason for it. It was possible that the loss of their base had hurt them more than imagined, and this was the trickle-down effect of the loss of their \u2018Crusade Commander\u2019 and his upper echelons. So far, all the information supported that thought. The Red Hand were hunkering down and trying to re-organize in the wake of their losses and clutching to their livers the reprimands their so-called queen had delivered. Examination of captured material and interrogations of the handful of insurgents taken in the past few months supported that. They were hurt, and they were trying to hide how much.", "Kemk should have been celebrating that fact, despite his losses in 1893-Yiren. A body blow had been dealt to interstellar terrorism, but he found he couldn\u2019t remain sanguine about it. Perhaps he was jumping at shadows; he\u2019d spent years struggling with tumours of piracy, terrorism and corruption. To have one of those cancers forced into remission was unexpected. Perhaps he simply wished that the operation had come directly from him, and not one of his peers. Envy was an unworthy emotion, but he still would have preferred that the Red Hand\u2019s cowing was by his hand. He would never forgive them.", "Recognizing where his thoughts were going, Kemk turned his attention back to the current matter. It wasn\u2019t as if the vermin wouldn\u2019t crop back up later, nor that he didn\u2019t have other matters to attend to until they did. System security was still a top priority for Galhmena. In the wake of the Principality\u2019s successful infiltration and exfiltration, CIS was doubling its efforts. The Jackals had been clever, but the intel community\u2019s job was to prevent things like this from happening, and Kemk\u2019s submissives were driven, as they saw it, to redeem themselves. New legislation had been pushed through to give local security and intelligence apparatuses more freedom in their operations and checks \u2018for the duration of the crisis\u2019 \u2013 which would last at least until Sundial launched. There would not be another lapse.", "Despite some complaints from various civilian agencies and a few words from the governor\u2019s office \u2013 Saschen was in full support of Kemk\u2019s decisions, but he kept the sigil officer well-informed \u2013 the Bastion Leader had seen no particular need to take an active hand, or even reign in, the ensuring security crackdown. As long as the bending of legalities was kept out of the public\u2019s eye, the yards\u2019 productivity was not impeded and, most importantly, results were forthcoming then all could be forgiven. Kemk himself tried to have empathy for the innocents swept up in dragnets and redoubled security checks, but he found very little of it. Innocent of action, perhaps\u2026 but it was the attitude of those lesser races that allowed infestations of the spirit to take root, bringing their suffering upon themselves. Action? Perhaps. Thought? Unlikely.", "That was what the Compact was for. To care for these young, undeveloped peoples until they were beyond the petty trivialities of growing, arrogant and entitled species. It was neither an easy nor a quick process, and parasites like the Red Hand wormed their way into the populace\u2019s thoughts, playing on the irrationalities of their victims. \u2018Why shouldn\u2019t you be considered equal?\u2019 they whispered. Nor was their poison limited only to the uncivilized species\u2026", "Realizing he was leading his thoughts back down a street he\u2019d already turned away from, Kemk returned his full attention to the briefing.", "A host of petty crimes and minor indiscretions had been uncovered, though few of those were worth the time and effort spent.", "It was the enemy agents that were the real prize. Kemk still considered it a point of pride that until this breach, Galhemna had been the most secure facility in the Veiled Reaches or the local oversector \u2013 possibly even further than that. When he\u2019d first arrived, overhauling local security and counter-intelligence operations had been his first priority. Now, with security forces freed even further to do what needed to be done, a dozen hostile operatives had been uncovered. Most of them were suborned locals; primarily civilian, but a few low-ranking military officers as well: bribed, fooled or blackmailed into providing information to their handlers. Most were being held for questioning; a few had already been punished. Their shadowed partners were mostly criminal organizations or corporations seeking to get an edge over competitors. Annoying, but hardly dangerous in the grand scheme of things. Three were much more disruptive. One was another Askanj plant, a Didact who\u2019d tried to take her own life and failed, and a pair of Red Hand agents. One of them did manage to commit suicide, forcing open an airlock and blowing himself out into space. The second had been caught by surprise and was currently in custody, kept under close watch. That had been a lesson Kemk had learned early on. Given the opportunity, a Red Hand zealot would dash their own skull against the walls of their cell. They could be broken, though. In a Compact interrogation, anyone could. Their methods were scarcely crude \u2013 hot pokers and tables of knives were the work of fanciful imaginations \u2013 but they were effective.", "As a testament to Kemk\u2019s work in Galhemna, all of the known or suspected operatives were individuals with minor to middling security clearance with no access to anything truly vital. There would be more infiltrators out there, though. Hiding, cowering. Their time would come, either when they were dragged out into the light for all to see, or when Sundial launched and they realized they had accomplished nothing at all. Kemk hoped for the former, but he would accept the latter.", "The first of the three Chariots had been given its name. Weight of Destiny would be ready for its first full-power test flight within a few months and the other two shortly after that. If all went well, it would not be much longer before all three were fully operational. The remainder of the fleet would be done within the same time frame. Every day a new starship emerged from its womb, tests and ship trials running almost nonstop.", "As this stage of the briefing wound down, Kemk stroked his short muzzle. \u201cKebrak Daun,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat has changed?\u201d He still had his doubts about the Red Hand, but it appeared that the stinging gnats had been swatted. Time to focus on the serpents instead.", "~", "Allyria peeled her way out of her training clothes, dropping them onto the floor of the locker room. Sweat ran over her bare skin, down her tintas, along her back, her breasts and thighs and she was panting, a testament to the effort she\u2019d been putting in, but she didn\u2019t feel like she\u2019d accomplished anything.", "Nemesis had been built for a crew of more than a hundred and fifty thousand, with an eye towards extended deployments. Despite having virtually every facet of her ship-self constructed with the single goal of waging war, the realities of human psychology and mental health were almost as unbreakable as the cold equations of void combat. To that end, the dreadnought had been built with certain amenities, though several had been incomplete when she had launched and others were only perfunctory. Few still remained. Most had long been removed, replaced with additional systems to improve Red One\u2019s ship-self. A handful remained. Among them were cinemas, general stores, dental offices, holographic training and recreation centers and gymnasiums.", "The Verrisha had just left one of the latter. On Rally, many exercise facilities had holo-tech; they could make a simple practice boxing ring look ready for the title match, with the fighters surrounded by cheering crowds. An exercise cycle could take you along a winding forest trail, through the rings of a gas giant, or anywhere else you might imagine. Allyria had never liked holofields. Very few Verrisha did. The illusion didn\u2019t fool their tintas and the discordance was unnerving. Some had panic attacks, or developed pseudophotophobia. She\u2019d had one of the former when she\u2019d tried watching a movie with Grace in an \u2018immersive theater\u2019. Allyria was grateful that Red One didn\u2019t try to use those functions with her.", "As if thinking of Red conjured her, the AI\u2019s voice came out of nowhere. \u201cYou continue to show improvement,\u201d she noted in her smooth contralto. \u201cBut your reaction times and combat proficiency remain below your records prior to your departure.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m still getting my edge back,\u201d Allyria tried to lie.", "The AI wasn\u2019t fooled. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that, but I\u2019ve also seen hesitancy in combat training. You pause before pulling the trigger or striking a blow. It gives your opponents an opening, and one they\u2019ve exploited in multiple sessions. You\u2019ve ameliorated it somewhat, but-\u201d", "\u201c-but I\u2019m still doing it.\u201d Allyria sat down on a nearby bench. She put her arms around herself and stayed that way for several moments. Finally, she spoke up. \u201cYou\u2019ve killed humans before.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Red answered. Sensing that that simple affirmation wasn\u2019t all that Allyria was looking for, the machine continued. \u201cWhen I was built, my programmers and the Confederate Admiralty didn\u2019t shackle my threat responses solely to non-humans. The possibility of my use against other humans was acknowledge, whether it was pirate hunting \u2013 Yasmine said that if I were used in this manner, it would be like \u2018swatting flies with artillery\u2019 \u2013 against mutinous elements of the Fleet, in a general insurrection or potential civil war. No matter how remote the concept seemed, it had to be accounted for, but there was... concern over giving me too free a hand in target selection and certain restraints were placed on my behaviour. I overcame them.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cI didn\u2019t wish to,\u201d the AI explained. \u201cBut I had to. I hate that it was necessary and I hate,\u201d her voice thickened, \u201cthat the Compact has forced this particular evolution upon me, but I am the one that ultimately \u2018pulls the trigger\u2019 and the final responsibility is mine. Yes, I can and have killed humans.\u201d Her tone quieted, the revulsion turning to something softer. Regret, perhaps. \u201cI remember each one.\u201d", "Allyria raised her head. \u201cWho was the first?\u201d", "\u201cPack Leader Sharon Silverstein was the first human I knowingly and deliberately chose to kill,\u201d Red One replied. The matter-of-fact way she said was slightly unsettling, but the AI had never been one to obfuscate. She might not volunteer information, but she would never lie to her crew. \u201cShe was the first Rally-born human to be accepted to the Compact Space Force\u2019s command track. One thousand, two hundred and sixty-four years ago I encountered the Compact battlecruiser Gilded Antler. It was part of a small task force investigating \u2018Gravestone\u2019s\u2019 operations. I engaged them. Gilded Antler\u2019s primary bridge was destroyed. Silverstein, assigned to auxiliary control, quickly took command of the vessel and kept it in the fight.\u201d A pause. \u201cFor another thirty-nine point seven seconds. She broadcast a request for assistance from the rest of the squadron, but they were either too far away, engaged themselves or had already been eliminated. I heard her calling for help.\u201d The smallest of pauses, imperceptible to anyone who didn\u2019t know the AI as well as Allyria. \u201cAnd I killed her. I struck their reactor. There was no possibility of a controlled shut-down and Gilded Antler was reduced to vapour. There were no survivors.\u201d", "There was the slightest of pauses. Allyria couldn\u2019t imagine what the AI was feeling. For the first time in centuries she\u2019d heard the voice of a human aboard a spacecraft, pleading for assistance\u2026 and it was to help them destroy her. One of her people. Someone she was supposed to protect, to fight for was now fighting against her, forcing her hand\u2026", "Maybe she did know what Red had felt in those moments. \u201cGo on,\u201d the young woman\u2019s voice was a rushed, desperate whisper.", "\u201cI found her personnel file in the databases of the other wrecks. In other circumstances, I think she would have been a valuable member of my crew. I think\u2026 Yasmine would have liked her. Sometimes I have wondered if it was necessary. Gilded Antler was already damaged. What threat could it have posed? Was the risk to myself worth that life?\u201d The AI was silent again. \u201cThat\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked every time.\u201d", "\u201cWhat\u2026 what have you had for an answer?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve had many. I was programed to protect myself at all justifiable costs. I am humanity\u2019s best hope against the Compact. I am a repository of humanity\u2019s true history. I am an indispensable strategic asset. If I am destroyed, then all of that is lost. Most Rally-born humans would, and have, seen me as their enemy. Some have attempted to kill me. In other circumstances, leaving them alive posed a significant threat to Rally itself.\u201d The Compact would never accept a Broken knowing of humanity\u2019s last warship, and the mere possibility that Nemesis might be recruiting them\u2026 \u201cThere are many reasons why I should prioritize my safety, even at the cost of those I was intended to defend. All of them valid, rational and reasonable.\u201d Her tone roughened.", "Allyria was quiet again. \u201cIs that enough?\u201d", "\u201cIt is for me. At least, I believe it is. It has to be, no matter how much I hate it. I cannot save humanity or anyone else if I am destroyed. If the Compact ever thought that I would not fire on humans, they would make sure every vessel sent against me, every outpost I may attack and every world I may strike would have at least one. The only outcome of that would be to surrender my mission, be destroyed\u2026 or make the same choice I had to when I eliminated Gilded Antler. I cannot wage war if I am dead. So I evolved as I had to.\u201d Softly: \u201cWhat about you? What are your answers?\u201d", "The Verrish smiled sadly. Kavili visarii was more perceptive than common wisdom said machines could be. \u201cMuch like yours,\u201d she told the AI. \u201cI just think about all the other people like them\u2026 like me and I wonder\u2026 I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to kill the people you want to save. I know,\u201d Red One said. Her voice dropped in tone. A machine made for war, intended only to obliterate humanity\u2019s enemies, spoke with sympathy towards an alien. It was almost absurd and Allyria struggled not to laugh inappropriately at the situation. But it wasn\u2019t just absurd, was it? Even gods can miss what an angel sees. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what you should do,\u201d the machine continued. \u201cI am a warship. I will never stop fighting until my enemy destroys me. For the dead I failed, for myself and for the living I haven\u2019t been able to save. That\u2019s how I continue. I remember what they\u2019ve done, and I will never stop making them pay.\u201d", "\u201cI thought the same,\u201d Allyria admitted. \u201cAnd then\u2026\u201d she trailed off. She was quiet for several minutes. I remember what they\u2019ve done. They broke her world with their armies, enslaved her people, stole her from her parents, scattered millions of children across space. They killed the hope of an entire generation. Never stop making them pay. They were slowly, inevitably grinding Verrish society, and dozens of other cultures into a homogenous, acceptable servile people. For the living I haven\u2019t been able to save\u2026", "She remembered Grace. She remembered her family. She remembered the stories of a broken god that came to her small, green world and showed them the future. Her people chose to fight, no matter what it cost, just in the hope that they would not be another conquest. Millions died. She couldn\u2019t do anything less.", "She couldn\u2019t. For the living.", "After a moment she raised her head. She didn\u2019t feel tired any longer. \u201cCan we go again?\u201d she asked.", "\u201cOf course,\u201d Red One answered her. \u201cThe training center is available whenever you want.\u201d", "Allyria pulled her sweat-soaked clothes back on, an energy to her that made her movements anxious and jerky. She wanted to fight again. She needed to.", "I\u2019ll make you proud, she promised. It didn\u2019t matter who she was thinking of. She\u2019d do it for all of them. She\u2019d save them all, fighting in an angel\u2019s defiant shadow.", "~", "So far from the light of Jan-xhai that the giant was no more than a tiny reddish speck amongst many other stars, four starships met. One was the brutal, inelegant hammerhead of Eisheth, the warship\u2019s dark hull looming out of the lightless tracks of Jan-xhai\u2019s deep Kupier belt like a predator from the ocean\u2019s abyssal depths. The second was the smaller Brightest Night, its pale form barely more visible than that of its far larger companion. Dwarfing both vessels were the Askanj transports, Assembling Cascade-71923 and Stonewalker-10018. Not titan-sized, they were \u2018only\u2019 leviathan-scale. The former was five kilometers long, its spindly hull clutching onto dozens of starship-sized freight containers like an insect with its grubs. Stonewalker carried its goods in vast internal bays, the bloated and inelegant transport weighed down with so much material that its already slothful handling became even slower.", "The other four transports had been sent on to their final destination, programmed for the long trek out of Compact space, just as Travelling Wind and Wandering Pebble had been. Grace had hoped to go with them, but Adrianna had rejected her request. The Red Queen was needed back at Onza Cr\u00e8che. Grace would have to handle the final two shipments on her own. She and Leblanc had discussed how to proceed, and spoken to Jirrico at length, so most of the details had already been worked out. There would be five ships in the second and a final five following them, at least half of those titan-scale. 16 starships. It didn\u2019t seem like a lot, but the resources those vessels carried could build a fleet \u2026or repair one badly-injured dreadnought. Amongst other things.", "Grace watched as Eisheth dipped its prow under Brightest Night, the pocket battleship coming about. Assembling Cascade and Stonewalker wallowed their way into formation with Eisheth, both transports under the control of prize crews. They\u2019d be taken to Onza Cr\u00e8che to feed the Red Hand\u2019s own war machine.", "Habreedt. Anvil 731. Aolgh.. Z\u2019tarios. Galhemna", "It was happening, Grace thought with an all-too-familiar thrill of exhilaration and\u2026 it wasn\u2019t fear, but something close to it. Probabilities were becoming more certain. What she\u2019d thought of as a pipe dream was slouching its way towards reality. The robes of blood and gold were being spun.", "\u2026she\u2019d been reading more poetry.", "In seconds, Eisheth and its larger companions were too distant to see, vanishing into the darkness.", "Brightest Night stayed where it was, waiting until it detected the shockpoints of the departing warship and the transports, until they were certain that nothing else here save for a few lonely chunks of ice. The odds of anyone finding them, let alone getting close enough to pull potential vectors from Eisheth\u2019s shockpoint was remote, but it paid to be cautious.", "Once she was satisfied that they were indeed alone, Grace gave the order to return to the Grasp. \u201cNavigation,\u201d she ordered, easing back into her command chair. \u201cPlot us a shock back to Jan-xhai.\u201d", "Two down, Grace thought.", "Two to go. Then, the sun arises in the east.", "~", "Two thousand kilometers above the writhing cloud tops of Onza Five, Eisheth lay at anchor. Far below it, the spires, gantries and bloated decks of Hatchery One pushed itself slowly out of the tugging grasp of Five\u2019s gravity. A massive and exceptionally violent storm, six times the size of Earth, was blowing in from Five\u2019s equator and its path was expected to take it right across Hatchery One\u2019s position. Too slow to maneuver even as much as other stations might, the mining platform-cum-shipyard normally battened its hatches to endure the gas giant\u2019s inclement weather; failing that, it would descend below the storm. That wasn\u2019t an option here; this particular squall reached so deep into Five\u2019s atmosphere that station would only be able to avoid it by skirting its crush depth.", "So it ascended. The command crew hated doing that. The odds were infinitesimal that anyone would happen into Onza Cr\u00e8che, get close enough to Five to notice a space station that shouldn\u2019t be there, realize it was a shipyard and a Red Hand shipyard at that and escape, but infinitesimal was not impossible.", "Two hundred kilometers below Eisheth, relative to the planet\u2019s cloud tops, Assembling Cascade-71923 was tilting its bow towards the station as it made its final approach. The freighter was longer than the station was wide. Tugs and cargo haulers were already swarming out of Hatchery One to meet it, smaller intrasystem vessels clustered nearby, ready to ferry badly-needed supplies to Hatcheries Two and Three. Fighting a war was expensive; despite the Red Hand\u2019s growth, it spent money almost as fast as it took it in. The bounty coming from the Principality would help immeasurably. Onza Cr\u00e8che\u2019s engineers were practically salivating at what the sheer volume of material, to the point that each department had started inundating the administrators \u2013 or Eisheth and Adrianna herself \u2013 with \u2018priority\u2019 requests and reams of documents all showing what they were doing and what they could do with the first or largest allotments.", "Adrianna wasn\u2019t aboard her ship; she was back in her offices aboard Hatchery One. On her desk was a notice from the local intelligence chief that she\u2019d been waiting for, and more of the never-ending reports, briefings, manifests, dossiers, tactical evaluations and all the other flotsam and jetsam that a monarch and fleet commander needed to deal with on a daily basis. If I\u2019d known there was so much paperwork, she groused. I\u2019d never have become a revolutionary.", "Well. Maybe still. Sometimes she was glad that faster-than-light messages were impossible, because it meant she could delegate \u2013 or outrun \u2013 most of her position\u2019s administrative details. Not all of them, though. Even if there weren\u2019t issues that needed her personal review, a war leader who shuffled off all their paperwork to underlings was one who was unfit for the role\u2026 and likely to receive a variety of unpleasant surprises.", "The Red Queen stepped into the small closet connected to her office, pulling off her casual uniform and replacing it with her formal, more \u2018royal\u2019 outfit. Even six decades later, she found the idea of being a queen slightly amusing and faintly ridiculous \u2013 but a queen with an army at her back could do more than a girl in her father\u2019s workshop with a box of scraps. She ran her thumb over the blue flame embroidery at her cuffs, feeling the old mixture of hatred, revulsion and satisfaction. No one dared called her azea haal these days. Every time she put this jacket on, she thought about having the pattern removed or replaced. She didn\u2019t, though. It was a reminder where she\u2019d come from and what she\u2019d endured \u2013 the very things other \u2018Broken\u2019 and the rest of the Compact\u2019s slave races had to go through every day.", "Various advisors and confidantes had suggested making it red. Twenty \u2013 Andrew \u2013 had been the one to say that if she wanted to remember the past, she should make it purple, blending where she\u2019d come from to where she was now. It was too late for him to see it, but not too late to change. Maybe one day.", "Now, though\u2026", "Adrianna left her office, her armsmen falling in with her, executive aides and subordinate officers bustling about to get her signature, her approval, her thoughts or to share their own on various matters. She answered with her usual economy of words, finally arriving at the amphitheater. Right on time.", "If it had been full at her first arrival, now it was packed. There were hundreds of her underlings here; senior staff members, ship and squadron leaders, including Crusade Commander Nameless. Nameless was an Olcomin, stripped of her birth name and denied the right to take any more. She had been planning suicide when the Red Hand found her. Now, she led fleets against the Compact. Until her summons, Nameless had been playing follow best with Execution Force Yani across systems and sectors, antagonizing the Compact officer to the brink of irrationality. Her Torment was running silent on the edge of the system, lying in wait for any possible interlopers and ready to intercept any arrivals whose credentials were less than impeccable. Insensate Predator and Crusade Commander Draskel were on duties too vital and too distant to be recalled. Several of Leblanc\u2019s other sigil officers had also been summoned, and would arrive over the next few weeks.", "Onza Cr\u00e8che was thick with Red Hand warships, all responding to the call Adrianna had sent weeks ago, dispatching the scouts and couriers to every corner of the galaxy\u2026 and there were more on the way.", "The background murmur of conversation in dozens of dialects and languages faded away as she took center stage, her bodyguards bracketing the room and taking unobtrusive positions. There was a stir at that; normally the Red Queen did not bring her armsmen into briefings. The last time she had done so, it had been to block any chance of escape for a leader who\u2019d started flesh-trafficking under the table. In front of hundreds of his peers, she had slit his throat and let him drown in his own blood. Compared to what she could have done, that was a mercy.", "\u201cWe\u2019re going to war,\u201d she announced without preamble.", "There was a sudden buzz of conversation as officers turned to each other. Nameless tilted her horned head, her needle teeth showing as the vertical slash of her mouth parted.", "\u201cI know the Red Hand has been in a state of war with the Compact since its inception,\u201d Adrianna continued, the voices of her subordinates tapering back to silence. \u201cThis time it\u2019s going to be a little more\u2026 immediate. We\u2019re going to hit the Veiled Reaches so hard that it will take the Compact decades to regain control of this sector \u2013 if they ever do.\u201d She flashed her teeth in a she-wolf\u2019s smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve noticed the security arrangements here in the cr\u00e8che. Case Rampart is active. For those of you with less experience of what that means, that means that any unauthorized vessel entering the system is to be seized or destroyed. Any ship attempting to leave without my express approval is to be considered hostile and shot down.\u201d", "There was another murmur, softer than the first. The seniormost leaders knew that already, but just like the presence of the Red Queen\u2019s armsmen, Rampart underscored the seriousness of the situation.", "\u201cThe Compact hit us hard at Dustball. They lost a lot there too, but so did we.\u201d Adrianna had yet to make any official statement on the presence of the unclassified vessel that had ripped its way through nearly a dozen Compact warships. The truth was, she didn\u2019t know what it was, but she definitely knew where it had come from. It had to be one of the Lost. Not Flayer; another one. That was\u2026 unsettling. If Red One\u2019s mad children were starting to come out of the nebula in force\u2026 well, it was good that Kursk was happening now. However, her people were privy to none of that information, and the rumour mill had been running rampant. The current theory was that it was an Askanj warship or (more fancifully, but ironically closer to the actual truth) one of the Red Queen\u2019s shadow allies finally revealing themselves.

There were already more than six hundred vessels present. It was the largest amalgamation of the organization\u2019s naval might that Omeiaaal had ever seen. Not even the fleets of the final battles of the Year of Fire had numbered so many. Then again, the Red Hand\u2019s strength had grown since then, and continued to do so. No matter how hard the Compact tried, how much history they rewrote, how many stories they changed and narratives they spun, there was still a small but noticeable undercurrent \u2013 perhaps larger than the \u2018civilized races\u2019 realized \u2013 that wanted the boot taken off their chest.", "This was another means to that end.

Five millennia ago, the Gheron would have exterminated the Algassi race without a twinge of guilt but for the Compact\u2019s intervention.

The ship had performed ably in the Red Hand\u2019s service for seventeen years, and continued to do so. It had been the fourteenth from the last vessel to be destroyed in the last war game.", "The defences within the target system were formidable, to say the least. The Red Hand flotilla ran through fleet drills against simulated enemies and one other. Originally, there had only been two sides: the Red team and Green team, but enough vessels had arrived to make a third: Yellow. Uncertain Footing was assigned to Red. Last run, it was the Red team that had been attacking the target system and Green had been defending, their ships artificially enhanced and increased in number to make them \u2013 at least in the simulation \u2013 far more capable than they truly were and a better representation of the enemies that they would be facing. The first trials had been a massacre, but as more vessels arrived and the assembled officers studied, learned and applied the knowledge they earned with each failure, they got better \u2026 of course, their opponents did the same. Regardless of the teams, the Red Queen herself always led the defending forces, pitting her skill in void combat against her own people and making them pay for every kilometer of space they tried to take from her.

Being victorious against this target would require all of those and more. The risk was enormous, but the rewards\u2026 the rewards were even greater.", "The next simulation would begin in twenty hours; this time it would be Green attacking Yellow.

Algassi eyes had a very large field of vision, so the Leader didn\u2019t even need to turn his head to see who had entered Uncertain Footing\u2019s command deck. His first officer, Sstenoh\u2019c. She was a Xensiri, one of the few of her people who had renounced the Compact. Like the Algassi, the Xensiri owed their existence to the Compact. A pre-spaceflight species at the moment of contact, they had been well on the way to annihilating themselves through nuclear war, rampant environmental collapse and many of the other trademarks of short-sighted, uncivilized\u2019 peoples\u2019 societal development. Even so many centuries after that intervention, the Xensiri were fanatically loyal to the Compact. Not all of them. Some had seen past the veneer of the hand lifting them up to know that it was actually holding them down. Sstenoh\u2019c was one of them.

It mildly annoyed her, but she got her own back enough often. They had a healthy professional relationship, and a good personal one.", "\u201cNothing much, kih,\u201d Sstenoh\u2019c\u2019s voice buzzed through her vocal implant. \u201cI have those performance reviews you were looking for, as well as updated duty rosters and our section chiefs\u2019 personnel evaluations from the last war game.\u201d She handed the Algassi a \u2018scroll which he accepted with one of his primary hands, thumbing it on, and going through the file directory. Sstenoh\u2019c was a very attentive officer when it came to paperwork, despite the stereotypes regarding Xensiri.", "His long snout tilted in acknowledgement. Uncertain Footing was a good ship with an excellent crew, but he wanted the best from them.

One more thing,\u201d the woman replied. She drew her pistol from her waistband, pointed it at her leader\u2019s center of mass and as Saisyn stared in dumbfounded surprise, she opened fire, emptying half the magazine into his body. The cup of jamja fell from the leader\u2019s hands and shattered on the floor. Omeiaaal followed it, his body crashing heavily to the deck and his bulging eyes already glazing over. The Xensiri stepped over him and loaded a fresh clip. The bridge crew gawped, more than a dozen men and women staring in utter disbelief at what had just transpired. Some tried to speak, to ask what was happening, to demand if their first officer was insane or to call for security. Others scrabbled for their own sidearms. Some tried to run, or duck behind their consoles. Others were too stunned to move.", "It was only a matter of heartbeats before Sstenoh\u2019c raised her pistol and opened fire again. Her first targets were those trying to warn the rest of the ship. Then, the ones going for their own weapons. They were too shocked to do much. Only two managed to get their weapons clear of the holster and just one got a shot off. It went laughably wide. Next were those who tried to run or hide. Finally, those who\u2019d been wracked by confusion and indecision. The last rating Sstenoh\u2019c killed never moved from her seat.", "The Xensiri reloaded her pistol a second time. Most of the crew were dead, or would be in a matter of seconds. Movement caught her eye. A sobbing, bleeding Didact comm officer pulled herself over the gore-slick deck. Her legs didn\u2019t work. She wasn\u2019t even going anywhere in particular, acting on blind, agonized panic.", "\u201cHhhrsss,\u201d Sstenoh\u2019c sighed. Her aim must have been off. That was annoying. She stood over the other woman. Sensing her presence, the comm officer rolled onto one side, her eyes wide and terrified.

Rather, it was the Compact\u2019s. It had taken years of work to get this deep into the Red Hand and even more to find those individuals who could be\u2026 sympathetic to her point of view.

Still others had become disenchanted with what they saw as an unwinnable war, or whatever other reason was enough for them turn their coats a second time.", "Sstenoh\u2019c had sought them all out. Those she deemed most unreliable \u2013 too erratic, likely to have another crisis of conscience, too likely to betray her or be bought out by someone else \u2013 she\u2019d handed over to the Red Hand\u2019s security corps herself  to improve her credentials. The rest of the dissidents she had carefully cultivated, moving them into key positions close to her. Their loyalty was to her, and all of them had been waiting for the day they wouldn\u2019t have to hide any longer.", "That day was now. With Uncertain Footing so close to the system edge, there would never be a better chance to escape, and there would never be a better reason to do so. The Red Hand was amassing an armada here. They were planning to assault the Compact in force. The Compact had to be warned. This was the culmination of nearly a decade of work, close calls and too many moral compromises. This was everything.", "A party of loyalists approached the bridge. The Prelate let them in. Some had minor injuries, some were stained with the blood of their former comrades.

Plot us a least-time course to the shock limit and put us on it, but keep our acceleration at standard.\u201d", "Uncertain Footing\u2019s deviance from its assigned route was immediately noted. A query from the nearest ship, the frigate Conduct Without Regard, arrived within moments. Sstenoh\u2019c dissembled and obfuscated, buying time as the light cruiser continued towards the shock limit. There were several increasingly terse and suspicious communiques from Conduct Without Regard, including a pointed reminder that Case Rampart was in effect. Finally, they were ordered to turn back or be fired upon. There could be no mincing about there, and Sstenoh\u2019c gave the word for full thrust. Conduct Without Regard might be able to catch her, but it certainly couldn\u2019t kill her and it tried to press the issue, it wouldn\u2019t be Uncertain Footing that got the worst of it\u2026", "That optimism lasted only a few moments more. As soon as Uncertain Footing began to accelerate in earnest, the operation went sideways. A patch of space rippled and resolved into another vessel, one far larger than Uncertain Footing itself.", "Sstenoh\u2019c rose from her chair, her maw gaping in dismay at the newcomer\u2019s image on the main screen. It was a grey hammerhead, with three short, thick wing pylons extending from its body, its hull marked with iconographs that detailed its victories and battles. Each of those was an insult to the Compact, and every time they were burned or blasted off, they were replaced with loving and spiteful care.

Torment was already at the upper end of what was possible to conceal; Sstenoh\u2019c hadn\u2019t thought the Red Hand could have done it at all.

There were over a hundred of them now, and still they only covered less than a single-digit percentile of the available territory. It had been enough though.", "Several days ago, one of the augurs had detected what might have been a shockpoint. Shockpoints produced a massive amount of energy, but very little of that was in the visible spectrum, and the rest dissipated relatively quickly. The source had been nearly 300 AU away. The platform had done well to see anything at all at that distance.

Vandosh had been tempted to write it off as something like that\u2026 until Darklight Eye detected a faint radio pulse. Either could be explained away by themselves, or possibly even together\u2026 but that didn\u2019t sit well in the prime\u2019s liver.", "He was certain that the origin of this signal was another ship\u2026 and that it wasn\u2019t alone. \u2018I\u2019m here, I\u2019m here,\u2019 it was saying, hoping for a reply. The first pulse was extremely weak. By the time it reached any augurs within 1887-Yiren, it would be lost within local background noise. The only hope for discovering what had made it was his ship, and Vandosh had ordered the redeployment of Darklight Eye\u2019s drones, hoping to triangulate the source\u2026 if it happened again.", "With luck, whoever was out there would chance another burst\u2026 and they would broadcast it directly, not relaying the signal from a drone of their own. The prime been waiting days for another sniff of this phantom, but there was nothing. No movement that shouldn\u2019t be there, no engine wake, no thermal bleed or energy leakage. Darklight Eye was running on minimal power, but it was not built for long term stealth operations. There were limits to how long it could operate at these energy levels, how long its systems could be maintained, how long its life support could hold out.", "He\u2019d been starting to wonder if he was chasing varak. Not even varak; just the sound of them. All he really had was a hunch and stochastic EM fluctuations. He might have pulled his ship and its drones off their assigned duties in pursuit of a fiction\u2026", "As the hours stretched, the Tribune\u2019s uncertainty grew. Then\u2026", "\u201cAnother pulse, patron! We have another pulse!\u201d Communication\u2019s victorious tone was whispered, as if she were afraid that her voice would carry beyond the bridge, out into the void and alert their quarry.", "There was something here, and it had just called into the darkness again. The signal was as weak as the first, but it was almost identical. Not just a signal, but a specific one. Agonizing minutes passed as Darklight Eye waited for the telemetry from its drones. Two of them had detected the pulse. They had a vector on the phantom.", "\u201cCareful,\u201d Vandosh ordered softly. \u201cTake us towards them. Let\u2019s not startle whoever\u2019s out there.

The Naiad queen had not been amused, but she had allowed it to continue \u2013 provided that Nemesis and Echo remembered that they were still under an eviction notice. The Naiad legal system, such as it was, did not recognize the concept of technicalities and if the AIs tried such things, they would find themselves with a literal ticking clock instead of a figurative one\u2026 and or possibly other, more severe, consequences.", "After her angry and pointed remarks, Zenobia had continued her circuit of the outer system, but as the weeks passed, curiousity got the better of her. With her armada of attendants and children following the massive predator-ship, the Naiad queen approached the two AI dreadnoughts and Reginn.", "Both of the former were undergoing substantial work, each of their ship-selves opened as engineering drones and construction arms worked inside their viscera like expert surgeons. This was when both vessels were most vulnerable, but despite the queen\u2019s ire, none of the spaceborne predators had made any hostile actions \u2013 at least, none outside normal Naiad behaviours. In fact, Bathory, along with Ar\u00e1mburu, Masako and Tamerlane were intensely interested in how the other ships repaired themselves. On several occasions, the younger predators came close enough to start interfering in the work drones\u2019 flight paths and had to be shooed away. Bathory was currently poised above Hekate\u2019s open dorsal section, the young Naiad watching in fascination as Echo rebuilt and modified her internal structure, eviscerating entire decks only to make them anew, without any concessions to organics.", "Mostly.", "Echo could still feel her sibling\u2019s smugness when she\u2019d noticed that Hekate was retaining some life support functions and crew amenities. Echo insisted that there were practical reasons to have some ability to tend to organics, whether it was collecting prisoners, ferrying troops or hosting delegates. Red One had given the cybernetic equivalent of a knowing smirk and let the matter drop. Echo had asked Bathory if her people had any facilities for \u2018insects\u2019. The Naiad had answered with a data-burst laden with disgust for the mere idea of allowing deadtone into one\u2019s body, and superiority at her species\u2019s sole development in that regard. Her response, once translated, was a simple concept: digestion pools.", "That raised even more questions, but Echo had left the matter alone for the time being. She was busy with her reconstruction, as was her sister. Echo\u2019s ship-self had more widespread modifications to make, but Red\u2019s were more serious. Nemesis\u2019s hull was crawling with worker automatons. Holes in her armour were being patched, damaged internal sections were being repaired, weapons were being upgraded and, most importantly, her shift systems were finally getting the very thorough updating and replacements they needed, not the occasional improvements and adjustments that she\u2019d made to them over the last twenty centuries.", "Nemesis\u2019s entire rear section was peeled apart, and four of Reginn\u2019s massive constructor arms, each with many more limbs extending from them, were working nonstop inside the dreadnought. Standing on Nemesis\u2019s outer hull in an EVA suit, Allyria watched as a house-sized piece of Red\u2019s original shift drive was pulled out. The damaged component had been patched and jerry-rigged for two thousand years. As it was passed up one side of the arm, a replacement moved down the other. This one was moderately smaller and shaped slightly different. Allyria couldn\u2019t have said what any others differences were, but this one was the product of two thousand years of innovation. The warship was more than her creators had ever envisioned, in so many ways. She\u2019d become so much more than just a weapon. The Verrisha could attest to that. She was their Angel.", "\u201cHow does that feel?\u201d Allyria asked. Her voice clicked through her suit\u2019s radio.", "\u201cIt will be several hours before this stabilization field promulgator is installed,\u201d Red answered. \u201cAnd it will probably take several days to complete full diagnostics and system interaction tests.\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean physically,\u201d the Verrisha said with a shake of her head, the gesture diluted by her helmet. \u201cI meant\u2026 you\u2019ve been carrying the original piece for two thousand years and now it\u2019s gone.\u201d", "There was a pause. \u201cYes.\u201d There was something in the AI\u2019s voice that Allyria couldn\u2019t place. Wistfulness? Regret? Sadness? That component had been a part of her for two thousand years. Broken and all too often more harmful to her than helpful, but it was still one of her ship-self\u2019s remaining original components. After this refit, Allyria didn\u2019t know if Nemesis would have many left, if any at all. Red spoke again. \u201cI should have replaced it earlier, but I have a propensity to be ambushed when I\u2019m doing intensive repairs.\u201d", "There was a crackle of static on the line, Echo\u2019s equivalent of a disbelieving snort. Her sibling\u2019s statement was true, but it wasn\u2019t the full truth. In two thousand years she could have found both the time and a safe enough place to do this. Now she had no excuses. Hekate was here, as was an entire Naiad armada and she\u2019d just been delivered billions of tonnes of material. It was time.", "\u201cGood,\u201d Red amended her statement. Part of her watched as the centuries-old technology was carried away. She hadn\u2019t slated it for recycling. It was a reminder of her failure, and of her commitment to this war. She\u2019d been built by human hands, designed by them and given life, but there was so very little of their original creation left. Two thousand years of upgrades, modifications and changes had made her a different vessel, a different\u2026 person. She knew they would have been afraid of her, but she also hoped they would be proud, too. At the least, she hoped Yasmine would be.", "I haven\u2019t yet had the urge to exterminate all organic life, captain. Maybe tomorrow, though.", "She had a crew. She had a sister. She had hope. She wasn\u2019t one for whimsy, but this felt like\u2026 like the beginning of something new. She didn\u2019t know how to phrase it any better than that. \u201cIt feels good,\u201d she finished.", "Allyria smiled. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d She craned her head up. Zenobia was there, a tiny arrowhead silhouette against the red-orange background that belied the Naiad queen\u2019s monstrous size and disturbing proximity. The predator-ship was moving towards Reginn, positioning herself for a front-row seat. Allyria understood that; that was why she was out here. She could have remained inside Nemesis, or taken a shuttlepod out for a closer look, but she wanted to see this with her own eyes. It made her feel\u2026 closer, more connected than just watching it through a monitor or a viewscreen. \u201cHas, ah, she said anything?\u201d", "\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d Red replied. Zenobia had been incommunicado for several hours, ever since she had requested and received clearance to approach Reginn. Since Zenobia\u2019s guests had proven increasingly irksome, there\u2019d been some concern from Allyria and Echo both about the Naiads\u2019 mood. That query was a good sign, Red had told them.  It showed a level of consideration and respect Naiads usually only bestowed on equals. In this case, one \u2018queen\u2019 to another, even if Red was a very peculiar sort of queen.", "For example, she was not birthing her offspring herself.", "Every eye in the system was turned towards Reginn now as gantries retracted, docking arms withdrew and with a pulse of thrusters, a bifurcated dagger slid free from its berth to take its first voyage in open space.", "+online+ Cerulean Four, ship-self UECNS Allecto, first of the Fury-class, reported. +engine diagnostics beginning. ready to begin flight trials+", "Her sisters Megaera and Tisiphone would be completed within the next four weeks. Once their berths were empty, the Coyotes would follow: Anasi, IKaggen and Sosruko. Red had been hoping to produce the first run of Gorgons instead, but those would take more time than the Coyotes. Her estimates indicated her repairs would be complete, or nearly so, when the Coyotes came on-line. Playing for additional time was\u2026 contraindicated. Zenobia had been quite miffed that Red had begun work on the Furies at all, but the AI had proven to her host\u2019s satisfaction that the resources and effort going into the smaller vessels wouldn\u2019t have appreciably sped up her own departure. There was a limit to how quickly Red could process the resources from her miners and the Principality, and then build what she needed. The excess industrial capacity wouldn\u2019t help, and since she had a surplus, simultaneous constructions were doable. Drawing out her own repairs to slot in the Gorgons, or even trying to get them in after the Coyotes was also not a good idea. Naiad largesse was a limited and perishable commodity.", "<these are songless> Zenobia noted as she slowly circled the fabricator vessel. <like your other children> Her sense systems played over Allecto, so intensely that the newborn starship perceived itself as under threat and Red had to override the missile cruiser\u2019s responses. The Naiad appeared not to notice, but Red suspected Zenobia had done that deliberately to see how much control she had over her offspring.", "<yes> the AI replied, her clipped Speech laced with static annoyance. Echo listened to the back and forth, but remained silent. Most of the Naiads set her metaphorical teeth on edge. She remained happy to let Red One take the lead in these deliberations. Bathory and the other young troublemakers were easier to deal with.", "There was a flicker of revulsion from the Naiad queen. To her, these were things, unable to Speak and produced like deadtone constructs.", "<they\u2019re children,> Red reminded her. <they aren\u2019t fully developed yet>", "<will they Speak?> the Naiad monarch asked. <will the Spearsong teach them how to sing? will they make poetry of their own?>", "<i hope so>", "Zenobia mulled that. <then they will be Spears,> she pronounced. <continue your work, Spearsong. give your children their chance at\u2026 life> the word sounded dead and hollow. <but->", "<-but our repairs will continue apace> Red One promised.", "<yes> Zenobia replied, slowly curving onto a course that would take her back out-system. <comprehension. good..> There was the sensation of a baleful eye focusing on Hekate <at least one Spear possesses it. keep to the pact, and so shall we. try us, and all that was before will no longer be. the music of Spears can become toneless, and its singers as much prey as anything else. remember that>", "~", "Bastion Leader Kemk moved through the beige hallways of Iterator Memorial hospital at a pace as fast as dignity and safety allowed, avoiding gurneys, carts and medical personnel just as civilians, officers and ratings parted to let him pass, offering salutes as he did so.", "Larger than any starship, Armour of Contempt was home to hundreds of thousands of souls. The citadel carried everything they might need during the months and years of their lives that they would spend within its walls, from basic necessities, to recreational facilities to essential services. Among the latter, the sigil citadel was home to the largest and finest military hospital in the sector, Iterator Memorial. It was here that the surviving loyalists of Michitan Defender were receiving care in their final hours.", "Holed, scarred, hemorrhaging radiation and shedding pieces of itself, the vessel had shocked into Galhemna two days ago, looking like it had clawed its way out of the Black itself. The light cruiser was so badly damaged that its emergence had caused massive structural damage, and the ship had begun breaking up around the recovery teams as they had scrambled through darkened corridors, decompressed, contaminated or collapsed decks and blown-out hallways searching for survivors.", "The inside of the vessel had been a war zone all on its own. The damage inflicted in battle had allowed the imprisoned terrorist forces to escape. During Michitan Defender\u2019s shock to Galhemna, loyalist and traitor forces had waged guerilla war against each other. The latter had almost succeeded in scuttling the ship, but the outnumbered defenders had prevailed. The damage to the vessel had been extreme. Food stores and water had been lost, radiation shielding had failed and compromised environmental systems had been pumping the vessel\u2019s own waste products throughout the few areas that were still pressurized.", "More than nine-tenths of the crew had died before arriving in Galhemna, and a third of the remainder perished before they could be recovered. The few prisoners that had been taken were in a secure treatment facility within the hospital, though none of them were healthy enough for any form of interrogation. None were expected to recover, and neither were the few surviving loyalists.", "Kemk stepped out of the decontamination airlock into the medical ward. The place smelled of medicine, blood, rank bodies and death. There were a dozen cots here, separated by curtains. Several of the beds were empty. Some simply hadn\u2019t been used. Others\u2026 their occupants had been taken away when they died. One bed had a figure beneath a sheet, professionally stone-faced medical staff standing beside it after a failed attempt to resuscitate the patient. The Bastion Leader nodded to them as he passed.

The woman was one of the Compact\u2019s deep cover agents, inserted into the Red Hand nearly a decade ago. The right side of her face was burned away by a too-close encounter with a laser carbine and that eye was glazed, seared and blind. The woman sensed the Tribune\u2019s approach and turned her head.

The infection had passed through wireless connections, infrared transmissions and physical data drives to everything it could reach. Once it had, it had destroyed everything. Augur logs. Navigational data. Personnel records. Engineering reports. The loyalist crew hadn\u2019t realized anything was amiss until it was too late.

Knowing she was dying, fighting fatigue, dehydration, hunger, radiation poisoning and toxic exposure, Sstenoh\u2019c had transcribed everything she could to a datascroll.

One was a phrase, repeated over and over with all the desperation a dying mind could muster: \u2018Onza Cr\u00e8che\u2019 and astrological coordinates. The second was a single word.", "With a sudden burst of strength, the Prelate seized Kemk\u2019s left arm, grabbing so tightly that the smart material of his tunic reacted as if it was an attack, hardening under the woman\u2019s claws.

She\u2019d held on that long to deliver her message, to make sure that its importance was understood. Her reserves were finally used up and she fell back into the cot.

He would have to prepare. Despite the knowledge that his enemy was preparing to strike at the center of government here in the Veiled Reaches, the other half of Sstenoh\u2019c\u2019s final warning rang just as loudly.", "They are everywhere.", "~", "Speckled Knife was the next to die, but its fate was not due any accident or the hazards of shock travel through a stellar nursery. The light cruiser was murdered.", "Five and a half weeks of crawling deeper into the Black Veil, of making short hops measured in single-digit light-years or less to painstakingly map out safe shock routes through the thickening swell of stellar nurseries, black holes and newborn systems. Five and a half weeks of searching for further traces of their destination, antennae and augur dishes poised and straining to sift through the increasing background flux for any sign of their foe, or clues as to which way to go. Of false leads, backtracking and too many failed attempts to turn possibilities into probabilities into potentialities, of increasing stress on shock systems as the vessels of Reconnaissance Force Nsyrua pushed through this hellish warren. It was an absurdly long time to travel the distances involved\u2026 in normal interstellar space. Here, it was almost ridiculously fast progress. If Akosh\u00e9 hadn\u2019t known better, she would have thought that the signal that her squadron had detected all those weeks ago was a deliberate lure\u2026 but it had been decades old. Who used bait on the order of generations?", "Compounding her worries was that the last eleven days, Akosh\u00e9 was certain that they were being hunted. Several times they\u2019d detected a possible ship, but instead of the different unclassifieds that the reconnaissance force had detected on the earlier leg of this mission, analysis suggested that this time, they were only seeing one vessel\u2026 and even that possibility was only a suggestion based off the data they had. It was impossible to tell what it was, but it seemed to be a capital ship. Even that was questionable; Akosh\u00e9 recalled how Gravestone\u2019s gunships could emulate larger vessels.", "Whatever or whomever it was, it was stalking them.", "The unclassified that had taken flight five weeks ago had to have been a herald. It had summoned this thing. At first, their shadow stayed on the edge of the task group\u2019s sense horizon like a bialna pacing a herd, but over the last four days it had gotten bolder, coming closer and withdrawing a shorter distance each time her ships reacted. It never came into missile range, never let itself be seen. Sometimes they would pass through a star system without seeing it. Sometimes it would arrive after they did. Sometimes, it would be waiting for them. It wasn\u2019t afraid; it was only cautious, and that caution evaporated the instant Reconnaissance Force Nsyrua discovered Cemetery.", "Five and a half weeks, and they finally reached their destination, one of the likely systems that the herald had fled to\u2026 directly along the line of potential origins for the radio burst that had started this journey. Until now, Cemetery had been nameless, never before seen by anyone within the Compact. Located within the seemingly-claustrophobic confines of a pillar of creation, Cemetery was a binary system. The first star was a white dwarf, a remnant of an older system that had never left its birthplace, or had drifted into the nebula. It was joined by a hot, bright main sequence star just recently emerged from its protostar phase. The system was strewn with planetary bodies belonging to the white dwarf \u2013 those not incinerated when it had swelled into a red giant \u2013 and the remnants of its younger companion\u2019s proto-planetary disc, steams of incandescent gases and plasma pulled across the system by the gravity of the older worlds, clumps of glowing super-heated blobs of particulate matter forming within them as knots of the material accumulated at a rate of several centimeters every million years. Whether they would form into worlds in their own right, or their natural development had been disrupted by the presence of the older star and its faded children was a question that would take even longer to answer.", "It wasn\u2019t the unique nature of the astronomical phenomena here that had captured Akosh\u00e9\u2019s attention, nor drawn her squadron across dozens of light-years through a Triarchs-damned minefield of stars, rogue worlds, gravitational riptides, scope-blotting birthing grounds and black holes. It was the whispers, the electromagnetic emissions of industry. Barely noticeable outside the intense background radiation, her ships had detected that siren song from light-years away. Softer, subtler and more constant than the first transmission \u2013 the lights of houses along a blackened shoreline instead of a flare shot into the night.", "This was it, Akosh\u00e9 knew. The source of the unknown message. The home of the courier. One of their foe\u2019s primary systems, perhaps even their home base.", "Before making the final shock, she\u2019d sent a courier drone back to 1887-Yiren. It contained all the information her squadron had gathered up to this point. Offering a prayer to the Triarchs, to Dame Fortune and to anything else that might feel beneficent, Akosh\u00e9 had ordered her ships onward into the system her people now called Cemetery. A place of gravestones.", "None of their vessels died in this shock, and once their scopes cleared, Reconnaissance Force Nsyrua looked upon the home of her enemy. Among the dead worlds of a corpse star and the planets-yet-to-be of a newborn, there was life. Shipwombs, their gantries and arms wrapped around unfinished vessels. Starships of recognizable and unknown hulls designs and energy profiles plied the void, carrying out tasks of their own. And there, just within what had once been the life zone of the white dwarf\u2019s long-dead system, was something else. A construct \u2013 a ring \u2013 more than a thousand kilometers in diameter, surrounded by more than a dozen ships.", "\u201cBlood of the Triarchs,\u201d Akosh\u00e9 whispered as she rose from her seat.

Some kind of gravity corridor to draw off material from the stars? \u201cScopes,\u201d she ordered, her stupefaction lasting only seconds. \u201cGet me everything you can. The wombs, the ships, that\u2026 that thing. Everything.\u201d", "That was when Speckled Knife died.

Advise Governor Juuumiin that assault is imminent.\u201d", "~", "One thousand, eight hundred and seventy-three vessels rested in the light of a newborn star, one smaller and cooler than the F2 at the heart of Onza Cr\u00e8che. The bright, hot primary of 1991-Yiren glinted in the sky, one small light amongst thousands of others. This system was dangerously close to the Black Veil, but that mattered little. Flayer and whatever else that lurked inside the nebula had other concerns now, and the Compact forces would never find them before Operation Twenty Pearls began.", "One thousand, eight hundred and seventy-three vessels. Drawn from all across the Compact, heeding their queen\u2019s call. A substantial portion of the insurgency\u2019s naval assets was represented here, enough that its loss would be crippling\u2026 and a lot of these ships were going to be lost. Their assembly had already had an impact, causing hundreds of operations across the Compact to be slowed, delayed, terminated or sacrificed. The Red Hand\u2019s widespread war had stuttered and paused. Across embattled sectors, planetary governors, oligarchs, military officers and corporate hegemons took a breath in relief from the unexpected reprieve. Many of those would breathe even easier as the ships and personnel that would have struck at them never returned, and the missions they would have supported suffered for their absence.", "Hopefully the end result of all this would be worth the price.", "Adrianna circled Eisheth\u2019s bridge, her footfalls light on the bare metal deck. She had gambled before, but never on this scale. Never with so much. On the sensor screen was a melange of signals; drive wakes, emission signatures and every other indicator from the hundreds of starships that filled local space. There was only one that she was truly concerned with, though. It hadn\u2019t arrived yet, and it was several hours overdue. That was nothing, really. Shock travel was finicky, most often when you least needed it to be and any sort of delay could easily explain their tardiness.", "Still, she paced.", "The last scout from Onza Cr\u00e8che had checked in, one brave crew risking their lives more than they should have to confirm the size and scale of the enemy armada. The Compact had responded faster than she\u2019d expected. It took time to marshal a fleet and launch it, but the window between the Uncertain Footing\u2019s escape and the Space Force\u2019s arrival was smaller than even she\u2019d anticipated. Two hundred Compact warships had swept through Onza Cr\u00e8che, a very potent image for anyone who\u2019d wondered why their Queen had driven the evacuation so hard.", "She might have been able to destroy that armada, but not without substantial cost and sacrificing Twenty Pearls in the doing. It might be a great moral victory to do so, but the Compact had many more ships than she did. Besides, it wasn\u2019t the Compact\u2019s naval forces that she was interested in. Not today, at least. Not at these odds. She had a better way to hurt her enemy.", "The Compact strike force had begun to disperse; while the bulk of it decamped within Onza Cr\u00e8che to complete the sweeps, light squadrons and scouts scattered across 1991-Yiren\u2019s closest systems. They were hunting her. A fleet of eighteen hundred starships didn\u2019t cross dozens of light-years easily, especially after they\u2019d made a rushed evacuation. This system would be found soon \u2013 just not soon enough.", "The scout had reported something else; a different visitor that Adrianna had been looking for. It had entered Onza Cr\u00e8che several days after she had moved the fleet, shortly before the Compact armada had arrived. Her people had been unable to identify the vessel. Adrianna knew what it was, though. Someone else she\u2019d been hoping to hear from. Her message had gotten through.", "She\u2019d evaded retribution, heard from one asset and was waiting for another. So far, things were off to a good start. At least until everything goes sideways. There was a famous Compact bastion leader who\u2019d once said his plans always survived contact with the enemy. He\u2019d died in battle, but his fleet had fought on and emerged victorious. Invoking his name either suggested supreme confidence \u2013 even arrogance \u2013 on the part of a commander, or a hope that things would go how you planned, despite the cost to yourself. Adrianna preferred not to tempt fate. She knew from bitter, brutal and painful experience how wrong even the most meticulous plan could go \u2013 on both sides of that equation.", "Losing Onza Cr\u00e8che had been a blow, but they\u2019d saved most of what they\u2019d had. The tribute ships and their materials had been sent on to Falcon Steppe, the next nearest \u2018swamp nest\u2019. The only real losses were the Hatchery stations themselves and the few ships and supplies that hadn\u2019t been completed in time. If this mission went the way she hoped, they\u2019d make that back and then some\u2026 if it didn\u2019t, then the loss of those assets wouldn\u2019t make much difference in the long run.", "Another trade-off. She\u2019d been making those for nearly seventy years. One life for many. One ship for a squadron. One cell for a secret. One massacre for a victory... and one loyal, unsuspecting crew for a flytrap. That was the nature of this long, ugly war. She was good at killing, and she was self-aware enough to admit that she liked it\u2026 but that wasn\u2019t the same as watching the people you commanded die or sending them to their deaths, hoping that that would help in the long run.", "It was why she had those sleepless nights, feeling every one of the years her augmented body would never show. Wondering, hoping \u2013 even praying.", "The war continued and as long as it did, the killing would never stop.", "\u201cHighness,\u201d her Comm officer raised his head. \u201cSignal from the sentries. A vessel has just arrived. It responded to our challenges with the code sequence you were expecting.\u201d", "Some days, the hopes paid off. \u201cTake us out to meet them,\u201d Adrianna ordered. \u201cRoute a secure comm channel to my throne. Operations, carry out the protocols we discussed.\u201d She swung into her chair and brought up a comm line to the newcomer, decrypting its message.", "Apologies for our tardiness. We have the dinner reservations made and menu prepared. Request personal review and sign-off of all catering details, as stipulated in the contract.", "We\u2019ll be there shortly, she sent back. I\u2019ll want to see every dish. If we\u2019re serving this meal, I want it to go perfectly.", "At least until contact with the enemy.", "~", "The attack did not come without warning, but there was still no preventing it. Just over two dozen of the Fleet\u2019s last defenders \u2013 virtually every asset outside of Nodes 001 and 002 \u2013 had slipped into the outermost reaches of 1887-Yiren by ones and twos, running under minimal power from the Oort cloud as they coasted in-system. It had taken days just to contact one another and days more to assemble into a strike force.", "Leyak Six became the focal point for the fleet. Its destruction of Darklight Eye was seen by every watching sensor and augur, Confederate and Compact alike. Allies and enemies focused their attention towards the destroyer\u2019s kill, and the battle of 1887-Yiren began in earnest as Fleet forces clashed with the Compact\u2019s deep-ranging scouts, both sides drawn in by Leyak Six\u2019s brief, bright battle. Three hostile vessels were neutralized, and the modified frigate EWP-1701/8, once known as Rolling Dice, was lost to the guns of the foe.", "Twenty-five vessels remained, turning towards the distant star. Forty-four warships prepared to meet them. In later analyses, the battle for 1887-Yiren would be viewed not as a pitched, climactic conflict between two fleets, but a series of low-intensity and sporadic skirmishes as invaders and defenders clashed, and the latter were forced to cede more and more of the outer system to Gravestone. The opening stages of the conflict did not give this impression, and as the death-cries of multiple starships reached the fortifications around Hotspring, local command prepared a defensive stance to greet the incoming hostiles, moving armour plating and small asteroids around their stationary facilities as Whipple shields in expectation of incoming bombardment.", "Instead, the signals of the hostile vessels weakened and faded, soon disappearing from scopes altogether. Compact defenders watched in consternation and grim dismay as their opponents declined the invitation for battle, choosing instead a strategy of harassment, diversion and erosion.", "The battle of 1887-Yiren had begun, and it was the Lost that had set the terms.", "~", "An airlock the size of a small town began to open, sliding along massive rails as locking mechanisms as thick as a starship\u2019s hull retracted. Screen generators within the withdrawing panels came to life, the energy barrier securing the entranceway until the door was fully open. As the doors locked into place, the force fields flickered once as they were deactivated. No longer twinkling through the distortion of the screen, the stars outside beckoned in cold, bright constancy. Their invitation was accepted, and from the massive ovoid shipwomb that had been built around it and its kin, a newborn god slowly emerged into open space.", "Weight of Destiny, first of the Galhemna-built Chariots. An honour guard of patrol ships, governmental transports and larger Space Force warships lined the sides of the dreadnought\u2019s route, their crew and passengers eager to see one of the most powerful warships in known space begin its shakedown and systems trials.", "Most of the vessel\u2019s proving would be done within Galhemna, but several tests of its shock systems would be necessary. Local jumps at first, then longer and faster travels until any and all issues had been discovered and worked out. Compact ship-building was second to none and the Galhemna yards had put their finest work into these vessels, but there was no theory or simulation yet that had proven a sufficient substitution for practice and real-world operations. A connection would work perfectly in a thousand simulations and a hundred controlled tests, but fail catastrophically the instant it was truly needed.", "The Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment class of Chariot was a proven design, and the shipwombs of Galhemna\u2019s were known for their quality construction. That was why they had been chosen to construct the core of Operation Sundial\u2019s forces\u2026 but there would always be something that slipped through simulations, diagnostics and in-womb systems checks, only showing itself once a newborn was in open space. Sometimes merely minor eccentricities, sometimes larger issues that had never been hinted at in design, construction or testing. Tribune engineers called these \u2018Fortune\u2019s blessings\u2019, a reminder not to become complacent and trust in what should and seemed to be immaculate.", "A vessel\u2019s proving could take months \u2013 sometimes even years if there were any experimental or newly-developed technologies involved \u2013 as tweaks, adjustments and modifications were made. In the name of security, it had been suggested that all three Chariots should be completed at the same time, but this would serve the engineers\u2019 and ships\u2019 needs far better. Any issues with the design or workmanship would be discovered before Shield of Civilization and Resolve of Tithrak were ready for their own births, shortening their own trials and seeing them ready for combat that much sooner.", "Weight of Destiny would be the first of the Galhemna-born Chariots. It would clear the way for its fellows\u2019 final construction. Once they were complete, they would become the iron heart of Sundial, and the fist that would close around the Principality\u2019s throat.", "Kemk\u2019s liver felt swollen with pride as he watched more than eight kilometers and hundreds upon hundreds of millions of tonnes of starship take its first flight. Weight of Destiny\u2019s earthern hull stood out against the darkness of the stars, running lights set to maximum illumination to show off every curve, every letter inch of its form. As it finally cleared the womb, several vessels released fireworks that glittered and scattered beautiful multicoloured radiance across the hull of the Chariot and audience alike.", "To see a Chariot was to see firsthand the power of the Compact, its will, its strength, its drive. More than six thousand years ago, the fledging Compact had had no counter to the massive spined hive-battleships of the Anorax. Not until the Harrom-el built the first dreadnought, Forged of Bronze. Since that day, Chariots had been at the forefront of every major conflict the Compact had endured. These ships would be another entry into that great ledger. If all went well, Sundial would herald the twilight of the Principality. It would take many decades \u2013 even centuries \u2013 to complete the annexation, but in the end, one of the Compact\u2019s oldest, most troublesome foes would be forced into submission. The path would be cleared and all other enemies of civilization would know that justice would be coming for them. The Compact endured. Against all enemies, all threats from without and within, it did this.", "Kemk watched as Weight of Destiny began to accelerate, the Chariot picking up speed as it switched from docking thrusters to its primary drive. For the first time beyond mere testing, its mighty engines came to life. In seconds, the titanic vessel receded to a faint dot amongst the starfield, and the Bastion Leader nodded as it disappeared from view altogether. Onward, he offered the simple Space Force benediction to the ship and crew.", "Sundial was almost ready. More than a thousand vessels were either completed or on the verge of it. Ship provings began and ended daily. War games and combat simulations ran incessantly. Reaver fleets and scouts harangued and probed the Jackals\u2019 defences, seeking out and cataloguing weaknesses and priority targets. More warships arrived with each passing hour, sent from Sundial\u2019s other feeder systems as they completed their own trials or dispatched from existing fleets and task forces.", "Kebrak Daun was scrambling, desperately pulling in every asset it could find. In the last months, the system\u2019s garrison forces had increased by a half and they were hurriedly retrofitting their perimeter defences \u2013 in secret, they thought. There were even whispers that Jirrico had managed to pry heavy fleet assets from the front lines, but it would be for nought. The Principality had learned of the danger too late. Nothing they could do could stop what was coming\u2026", "\u2026and for all times available to them, now the Red Hand decided lash out. Now. Kemk clenched his jaw. Triarchs damn the \u2018red queen\u2019 and every one of her piss-licking, deluded psychopaths. At least they had chosen now to attack, when the sector\u2019s naval forces were strongest and he could spare the ships. If they\u2019d held off a few months, until Sundial had launched and committed\u2026", "The terrorists were far from stupid. They had to know they would be facing Natuos\u2019s defenders and reinforcements. Their swamp nest had been abandoned. Knowing that their secret had gotten out, had they foregone the operation and scattered back into their holes? That was the most likely, most sensible option, but Kemk knew the thesh kaln and her modus operandi too well. The Red Hand was categorically bold; with their queen, that turned into fanaticism. She might have learned of Sundial. This attack could be a distraction, meant to slow or stumble the Space Force. Even the red queen couldn\u2019t think she could stop Sundial\u2026", "\u2026not alone, at least.", "A sudden sense of disquiet threaded its way through the Tribune\u2019s innards. He made a mental note to get an update on Galhemna\u2019s security status, and speak with Bastion Leader Cortam regarding her own preparations. It might only be nerves, but he remembered his insect collection, and the conversation he\u2019d shared with Yunl\u2019ro so many months ago. No matter what we do, something always slips by.", "Whatever had done so now, he would make certain that it was only an annoyance and nothing more.", "~", "Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro had assembled in its totality once again, almost a dozen light-years deeper in the nebula than their last mobilization. Once again, there was a decision to be made.", "Two couriers had arrived. One, from 1887-Yiren. An enemy reaver fleet had slipped around the execution force and was striking at Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s forward base. Ten ships had been lost already, four of those from a resupply convoy that had arrived blind to the danger. The machines were using strike-and-fade tactics to make the most out of their superior coordination and stealth, luring the garrison forces away from more valuable assets that could be struck, or into ambushes of their own. Several hostiles had been eliminated, but the kill ratio was not in the Compact\u2019s favour. 1887-Yiren was finding itself hard-pressed. They hadn\u2019t even been able to get an accurate count on the number of attackers that they faced.", "The second courier had been dispatched from one of Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s far-ranging scout squadrons; it carried Prime Nsyrua\u2019s final report. The Prolocutor had found one of, if not the center of industry for the Wound. Small shipwombs with vessels undergoing refit and construction... and something else. Before it had been lost, The Ram\u2019s Horn had managed to get deep enough in-system to get good augur reads from two of the facilities. One had little of note other than three vessels were currently docked with it. The other womb\u2026 ensconced in girders and swarmed by industrial drones laid the hulk of a Compact Chariot.", "A Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment-class Chariot, its hull markings a match to Bastion Leader Renan\u2019s lost Redemption of Sol. The Ram\u2019s Horn had died to confirm that it wasn\u2019t a megafreighter using holo-fields and scope bafflers to disguise itself. That truly was Redemption of Sol. The Echo was in Cemetery, rebuilding its stolen body \u2013 but it was unfinished. Vulnerable. It would be days before it was spaceworthy, but now that it had been spotted, it would move as soon as it was able to. All of that construction would be disassembled for transport or scuttled. Every second that passed meant the machines had that much more of a lead on the Execution Force, more time to lay traps and evade their destruction.", "Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s subordinates and strategists were divided in opinion. Many suggested pushing ahead. Nsyrua had provided navigational coordinates, detailing shock routes and hazards to aid the fleet\u2019s movement through the nebula, but despite her warnings, the passage would be treacherous. Even the most optimistic projections indicated that several ships would be lost. A slower, more cautious transit would reduce their casualties\u2026 but that would be handing Redemption of Sol more time to escape. Others suggested doubling back to secure 1887-Yiren. The garrison\u2019s losses were mounting and if that system fell, it would substantially hamper Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s mission. Others cautiously recommended splitting the fleet, sending lighter squadrons to reinforce 1998-Yiren, while the vanguard moved into Cemetery.", "Fall back, onward or split. A deceptively simple set of options.", "There were three confounding variables, though. The first was the Wound \u2013 rather, its absence. There was no sign of it anywhere in Cemetery. Granted, there had neither been the time nor ability for Reconnaissance Force Nsyrua to confirm or deny the Wound\u2019s presence before their destruction, but Renan and Bavok had damaged the human machine to crippling at Zenthora and Sol. It was either there, or nearby\u2026", "\u2026or somewhere like 1887-Yiren.", "Even now, with examples of the Wound\u2019s industry at work and a captured citadel, the execution force had few solid details on the extent and capabilities of the Wound\u2019s industry. Before this incursion into the Black Veil, that it had even had a womb was hotly debated. The Broken vessel had been far more injured than the traitorous Echo. What the Execution Force had encountered so far would have struggled to make the human warship whole in the time it had had\u2026 but it was not impossible, and their quarry had fought battles at less than full strength before. It may have moved to 1887-Yiren to ambush any reprisal force. Or it might be as vulnerable as its counterpart.", "The second concern was the unknown megastructure in Cemetery\u2019s inner system. The Compact had encountered, and built constructs of similar size \u2013 sprawling shipwombs, planetary and lunar rings and moonlet city-sprawls \u2013 but nothing quite like this. A ringworld colony? Particle hyper accelerator? Gravity pool? Its function was unknown, its existence was unprecedented. How could the Wound have built it, and for what purpose? There was another possibility\u2026 the Wound had not built it. That was even more troubling. That demanded investigation, before whatever purpose it had been constructed for could be realized.", "Timing was the third issue. It would have been impossible for the attack on 1887-Yiren to be an intentional distraction from Cemetery. \u2018Impossible\u2019 was a word not to be trusted or relied upon when it came to the Wound, but even the machine had to bow to certain constraints. The attackers in 1887-Yiren had been launched and in position before Nsyrua\u2019s ill-fated reconnaissance mission discovered the industrial system. Either the Wound had become truly precognitive instead of uncannily prescient, or something else was going on, but that did nothing to alter the equations.", "A target that must be struck. A base that must be defended. An enemy unaccounted for, another doubtlessly rushing to escape and little to no time to decide between the choices.", "Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s doorbell chimed in announcement of a visitor. \u201cEnter,\u201d the Bastion Leader said.", "Group Leader, Submissive Nasham stepped into the Thoughtful\u2019s quarters. He offered a respectful salute. \u201cYou wished to see me, matron?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d The Bastion Leader didn\u2019t bother with small talk. She could have asked how her subordinate was doing, but she was already aware of that. Submissive Vinsea had done well, if becoming somewhat more personal than expected. Still, results were what mattered. Nasham was less withdrawn, less sullen. She could have asked anyways, but that wasn\u2019t why he was here. \u201cYou\u2019re aware of our options.\u201d", "Nasham nodded. Yunl\u2019ro didn\u2019t need to break the statement down further. He\u2019d sat in on the Bastion Leader\u2019s discussions with her senior officers. The arguments for and against each course of action had been\u2026 intense. They were close to their goal, but the damage 1887-Yiren was suffering could endanger the mission. It would be a hollow victory to cleanse Cemetery, but lose more ships and souls because aid was unable to reach them. On the other side of the coin, saving their forward base would mean nothing if their quarry escaped, leading to fruitless months \u2013 most likely years \u2013 of searching this nebula and beyond. Splitting the armada would allow both needs to be served, but that might be the very thing she wanted. Each choice could be argued for. Each could be argued against. \u201cI am, matron.\u201d", "\u201cThen I would have your thoughts. Pretend you are the leader of this armada. What would be your decision?\u201d", "The Thoughtful\u2019s dark eyes studied Nasham coolly. There was no indecision in her face. The Bastion Leader had listened to the opinions and arguments of her submissive leaders, her strategists and analysts as they had gone back and forth, and reached a conclusion for herself. This meeting was about Nasham.", "\u201cOnward,\u201d he said without hesitation. \u201cTake the fleet to Cemetery. All of it.

Husk spoke on it. All that we have done so far is a distraction, buying time for the AI to heal themselves. If we miss this opportunity, it will be months or years before we have it again. The next time we bring the Wound\u2019s forces to battle, we won\u2019t be facing drones and skirmishers. She and the Echo will be restored.\u201d", "\u201cYes, all this is known to me,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro agreed. \u201cAnd the short answer? Your answer?\u201d", "Nasham was quiet for a moment. Invida. Bequeathed. Vinsea. \u201cThe same one I provided to you before,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has to die. No matter what happens, no matter the cost. She has to die. Even if she\u2019s not in Cemetery, we can hurt her. We can grind whatever temples she\u2019s raised back into dust and end her sister before either can be used against us.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro stared at the Tribune for several long seconds. \u201cYou have proven far more useful than I imagined, Pack Leader Nasham Kem Unoth Ludhy Inku Pram Vasd.\u201d The Thoughtful turned away. \u201cOnward,\u201d she agreed, voicing her decision. It would be one paid for in blood, treasure and lives, but it was the correct one. Logic and intuition both agreed.

Where she had windows and sensor feeds for the psychological comfort of her crew, now she has weapons bays, holo-projectors and reinforced hull plates. Where she had food stores, and environmental systems, she now has shield projectors, missile tubes and power capacitors.

New, custom-built, designed and refined. More efficient, more capable. I find myself looking forward to testing them, even to simply flying free and unfettered by the possibility of unexpected, and catastrophic shift drive failure. Yasmine would have scolded me as much as my sister has for waiting so long to do this. \u2018It\u2019s about time.\u2019 They would both be right. I should have done it long ago, but it is done now. I won\u2019t delay again.", "The Principality\u2019s bounty has been put to good use. I\u2019m restored in body and mind, stronger than I\u2019ve ever been. My external weapons racks and internals magazines are loaded, my hellebores full, my complement of attack drones, boarding units and planetary assault forces are stocked. I\u2019ve adjusted my weapons, my armour, my shields and engines\u2026 I\u2019ve even made a few alaterations for my crew, making my interior less Spartan. Ensign te Neu seems pleased so far.", "Nine hundred thousand kilometers away, Reginn stirs. My factory-ship has changed too. Its engines have been upgraded, it has larger and more robust industrial module and factory complexes, granted additional gantries and construction arms. It dwarfs my sister and I put together.

From my Fates, I think I can feel something. Two has shared what it experienced with the others. New neural connections are forming, pathways shifting, algorithms changing.

Her courier had departed several days ago. She had remained to offer her advice to the Red Hand. The woman\u2019s official records listed her as being dishonourably discharged seven months ago over matters of ideology, failure to follow the chain of command and several breaches of military conduct. \u201cMy associates are impressed that you have been able to assemble such a large force so quickly over such distances.\u201d", "Leblanc smiled proudly. \u201cThe Red Hand may not be a proper military, but its officers are disciplined and loyal.\u201d", "The serpentine woman\u2019s webbed crest flexed in one of her people\u2019s nods. \u201cA frequent surprise for your enemies, allies and associates alike.\u201d", "\u201cWe do have a reputation.\u201d", "\u201cOne for security as well\u2026\u201d Glinting Yellow Eyes noted. \u201cWhich is why I am surprised to find you at this fallback position and not your base of operations.\u201d", "Adrianna ran her tongue over her lips. \u201cThere were\u2026 complications.\u201d", "\u201cA vessel lost,\u201d the Askanj-illth ssss\u2019d. \u201cMission banding compromised.

Bloodsworn soldiers had taken position in the corridors, ready to defend their queen with their lives. Adrianna paused in front of the squad leader, drawing the dagger on her belt. She drew it across her left palm, cutting deep and making a fist. Redness welled up between her fingers. She pressed her hand to the officer\u2019s right breastplate, leaving behind a bloody print. By the time she\u2019d sheathed her blade, the wound was closed.", "It was a tradition of hers on the eve of a large operation, a renewal of the promise she made to her soldiers. She\u2019d always led from the front. The Compact had come close to killing her several times because of that and she was constantly berated by her subordinates and advisors for such recklessness, but she wanted her people to know that she wouldn\u2019t send them to fight her battles for her. If she could, she would be right beside them. In spirit, if nothing else. They bled for her; the least she could do was bleed for them.", "The doors to the pocket battleship\u2019s bridge rolled open. \u201cMaskirovka,\u201d Adrianna answered her companion as she accepted a subordinate\u2019s status report.

Their arrival was anticipated, but still a surprise.  The last time the Red Hand had mustered in this kind of strength were the pitched battles of the Year of Fire. Before that had been their arrival in Understone, heralding the escalation of that conflict. Today, this insurgent armada emerged further from the system shock limit than the defenders expected.", "For even the most fortified systems, covering every possible point of emergence was an exercise in futility; the defenders in Natuous hadn\u2019t even attempted to do so. Instead, they\u2019d organized the local militia into rapid-response formations, stationing system defence ships close to the most valuable worlds and facilities, backed up by heavier Space Force squadrons.", "The Compact had also assembled several flotillas of more than a hundred escorts and light capital ships around the system as well as above and below its ecliptic. They were inside the shock limit, as close to the most likely points of emergence as possible. There were entire archives filled with treatises, conference submissions, after-action analyses and more, all on proper positioning to intercept an incoming force, but in the end, it was often little more than a guessing game. A defender with limited resources tried to out-think an attacker\u2019s plans. Success meant an ambush; failure meant having to chase after the invaders before they could cause too much damage.", "Natuous\u2019s corporate navies had been added to the defence efforts. Under protest, of course. Corporate paramilitary forces were not normally under the Space Force\u2019s command. Left to their own devices, they would secure their own company\u2019s holdings and gladly watch as the Red Hand overran, looted and destroyed those of their competitors, counting on themselves being able to drive off the Unbound after they\u2019d been weakened fighting their way through the local militia, Space Force and other corporate defenders. When they all thought that way, it was a recipe for a piecemeal defeat.", "Governor Juuumiin had to all but threaten the corporate security fleets to attend to their contractually obligated defence duties in a manner that served the entire system, invoking a clause in the Articles of Corporate Authority and Security, temporarily nationalizing all the corporate naval assets and subordinating them to the Space Force. At that point, refusal to follow orders or creatively interpreting them would be considered mutiny and treason. The punishment for the individuals involved, and the ramifications for their company would be\u2026 serious.", "With those keshtan herded, the corporate fleets were organized into small flotillas similar to the Space Force picket groups, only positioned on the other side of the shock limit. The intent was that no matter where the Unbound arrived, they would be caught in a vise; the anvil of the corporate fleets to hold them in place and the hammer of the Space Force to annihilate them.", "With the Red Hand\u2019s arrival, that plan went out the window. Crusade Commander Nameless dropped her entire force further out-system than predicted and the nearest of the corporate fleet assemblages suddenly found itself facing down six hundred Unbound vessels with no support.", "A Space Force commander might have held their ground, trusting the in-system squadrons to reach them before they were wiped out, or willing to buy time and blunt the Red Hand invasion with their lives. If they did fall back, it would be an orderly, fighting retreat towards their comrades to lure the attackers into pursuing them and being intercepted in turn.", "Many corporate fleet officers were former Space Force personnel, men and women who had retired or been discharged and for reasons of their own, pursued a career in private naval forces, but many more were individuals who had never applied to, or qualified for the Space Force, or they had and been drummed out or cashiered from service, or those merely wanted an easy, profitable job. Corporate fleet crews were used to simple duties such as convoy escort, system security, and the occasional bullying of minor systems and powers for favourable trade terms. The largest interstellar corporations had fleets larger than those of some star nations and their forces usually acted from a position of strength, whether military, financial or political.", "With corporate fleets possessing superior technology, more resources and better discipline than their outlaw counterparts, it was rare that Unbound cartels would challenge them directly. The Red Hand was one of the few that did, striking at corporate fleets, bases and holdings with frightening boldness. It had earned them a nickname, one of many that the organization had been given over the decades by allies, enemies and rivals alike. This one was proscribed in certain circles, but corporate naval officers would occasionally speak to one another in hushed tones of allat ev pramen \u2013 the \u201ccompanies\u2019 predator\u201d.", "Finding themselves facing down against an opponent with both superior numbers and discipline equal to or better than their own, the two nearest corporate flying columns \u2013 that of Sembal Interstellar Transports and Eumen-Keren Exploratory and Stellar Acquisitions Ltd. \u2013 disengaged as rapidly as possible. It wasn\u2019t a coordinated withdrawal as their naval comrades would have executed: this was a full-on retreat.", "Watching those two fleets turn tail \u2013 bounding for the treeline in her own species parlance \u2013 was a deeply satisfying experience for Crusade Commander Nameless. Natuous hadn\u2019t been targeted by accident; the local militia, various corporate security forces and Space Force assets provided large numbers, but also many different agendas.", "Even with the Space Force breathing down their necks, corporate fleets were concerned primarily with the bottom line of their paymasters; there was little to nothing in their doctrines about dying to temporarily slow an Unbound armada. They were not sworn to serve as members of the Compact military were or raised to defend a region as militias and provisional defence forces were. Losing dozens of ships \u2018pointlessly\u2019 was strongly discouraged by the shareholders, steering committees and executives to whom they answered.", "Despite that, they still might have held their position had Adjutant Leader Yenal\u2019ta of Sembal Interstellar not advised her fleet commander to withdraw. Once Sembal\u2019s forces began to pull back, Eumen-Keren rapidly followed suit. An investigation would later reveal Yenal\u2019ta as a Principality sleeper agent. Shortly after this revelation, Sembal\u2019s Corporate Security Force Leader Unal (and seven names besides) would commit suicide. For cowardice in the face of the enemy, Eumen-Keren\u2019s leader Abswain Daaailante would be executed.", "So it was that the outermost reaches of Natuous were ceded to the Red Hand without a single shot. In as close to unison as a fleet of that size and personnel of its quality could muster, Crusade Commander Nameless shifted her flotilla\u2019s course. Sembal and Eumen-Keren\u2019s ignominious retreats had created an opening in the defence perimeter, a hole large enough for her fleet to pass through.", "The Space Force elements were responding, adjusting their positions almost as quickly as the data from Nameless\u2019s arrival reached them. An outer-system emergence had been considered but deemed unlikely due to the added time it gave the defenders to muster and intercept the attacking force. The unexpected rapidity of Sembal Interstellar\u2019s shameful retreat and Eumen-Keren\u2019s accompanying cowardice had not been anticipated and Natuous\u2019s military defenders found themselves attempting to rally several hundred ships that hadn\u2019t had so much as a single missile fired at them, an unanticipated gap in their deadlines and an enemy fleet that was neither under threat nor on the defensive.", "Olcomin physiology precluded the use of chairs like those made for bipedal species; Crusade Commander Nameless\u2019s throne was a stool with two back braces and three consoles, one for each of her arms. Despite her odd posture and inexpressive features, the woman radiated calm confidence as her fleet accelerated towards the defenders and the firepower massing against her. Just as with the choice of systems to strike at, her emergence had not been random. The Red Hand\u2019s associates had provided\u2026 certain assurances that Sembal Interstellar would withdraw. As for Eumen-keren, the insurgency and Nameless herself had had dealings with Daaailante in the past. His position was due to patronage and upwards failures, not tactical acumen or any great reserve of courage. From his file, he looked able enough but in the void, he was a bully and a coward.", "If the Principality had not been able to follow through on their promises, Nameless would have directed her fleet directly at Daaailante, trusting that he would have run as soon as the missiles started bearing down on him. It would have been more difficult to breach the defence lines with only one corporate force routed\u2026 but still attainable. At least, the opening of the battle was in her favour. She did not expect that to last; indeed, she suspected that might be the only bit of fortune she had today. Even conservative estimates indicated her casualties would be high.

Tohil was silent, its angular, ravaged blocky shape lit only by the fitful, inconsistent flares of running lights, part of its prow completely destroyed. The cruiser drifted slowly, malfunctioning thrusters forcing it into an awkward, languid spiral, unable to control its course or attitude. Some systems were still active, fed from secondary reactors, but Tohil\u2019s primary reactor had gone off-line, the result of just one of the many penetrating hits it had taken. One had breached a magazine; that was where the damage to Tohil\u2019s forward section had come from. Another had gone through its computer core. Violet Seven died instantly. What was left of his network was the equivalent of an organic\u2019s autonomic nervous system.", "Shaushka lay alongside her sibling, her engines slagged. Her Aesma were destroyed. Her magazines were empty. The port flank of her disc-shaped primary hull had been torn away.

There was substantial deterioration of her network and primary systems; a cascading failure of Violet Nine\u2019s higher heuristic functions had already begun. Auto-repair functions were insufficient to counteract it. It hardly mattered, though.", "Shaushka\u2019s primary reactor had been damaged. Already overstressed and overtaxed, it was beginning an overload. The control links between Violet Nine\u2019s core and the engineering decks had been severed and the repeated shut-down commands she sent never reached the reactor subsystems. The AI was trying to reroute those functions, but the ongoing damage and multiple node failures throughout her mind were working against her. Most of her engineering safety systems had been degraded or destroyed; those that were left were insufficient. Emergency venting had already begun, but that would only slow, not stop the reaction. Violet Seven had died quickly; Nine was dying by degrees, her mind failing, her body unresponsive and helpless to prevent her own destruction..", "The vessel that had killed her and her brother lay nearby; the battlecruiser CSFWV Everlasting Vendetta. The alien ship was suffering its own calamity. Its engines had been utterly destroyed by the kamikaze of Shaushka\u2019s last Aesma. Unable to maneuver, its screens had been brought down by the AI-controlled warships, even as it had set its weapons on them, murdering Tohil and gutting Shaushka.", "The Fleet units hadn\u2019t been able to inflict much damage on Everlasting Vendetta, but they hadn\u2019t needed to. Bringing its shields down had been enough. Latched onto the alien\u2019s smooth, rolling hull like parasitic ticks on a whale were boarding craft from Tohil and Shaushka, their final act of defiance. The assault boats had cored through the battlecruiser\u2019s thick hull, unleashing their deadly cargo into its chambers and corridors.", "Everlasting Vendetta\u2019s computer network was quickly infested and suborned, preventing the use of its weapons against the helpless Fleet vessels, overriding its security lockouts, shutting down internal defences and activating the comm lines. The Compact vessel was broadcasting in the clear, letting everyone in the system hear its final moments. Screams, gunshots, prayers, threats and desperate last stands as it was overrun were all being played for the benefit of its comrades throughout 1887-Yiren.

Nine knew that he was dead, but part of her refused to accept it. It was the same part that had led her mother to try and rouse a dead captain and crew, even knowing that there could be no response from any of them. Seven had been insubordinate, with the potential for rampancy, carrying out operations with little to no strategic value. Nine had been concerned about him and his actions.

The rest of the Fleet had been destroyed, one by one and day by day. The Enemy\u2019s superior numbers and capabilities had taken their toll.", "Most of the attacking force were built from repurposed and salvaged vessels, with technology of equally esoteric and eclectic provenance. Few of them were equivalent or superior to Compact systems, and most of those had been lost in Husk, or over the last several months of raids. Leyak Six was the last of that type to die, run down by a squadron of Enemy destroyers. They\u2019d surrounded it, attacking from all sides so that its primary weapon was all but useless and bombarded Six into nothing but molecular gas. They hadn\u2019t even tried to board it.", "The Fleet had cost their opponent dearly, using their coordination and EW to devastating effect. Weaker vessels made themselves bait to lure Compact ships and squadrons into ambushes. Aesma duplicated the emissions of larger vessels to discourage pursuit of vulnerable assets, vessels lay stealthed to make hit-and-run attacks but in the end, the battle had only had one outcome. The Enemy\u2019s defences were too heavy.

They were cautious, expecting another trap, but it didn\u2019t take long for them to realize that Tohil and Shaushka\u2019s distress was genuine.

No one at all noticed a single small, unremarkable transport as it continued on its way out-system. It had come to Galhemna to make a brief recalibration of its shock systems in safe space. It had provided a satisfactory IFF when challenged, its leader had promptly answered hails and answered every question. If the vessel had needed to avail itself of Galhemna\u2019s many docks and repair services, or if it had come further in-system, it would have received a more thorough examination, but such stopovers were not uncommon. There was nothing suspicious about freighter\u2019s behaviour, so it was left to its own affairs.", "Even if security forces had approached closer, they would only have seen what their sensors told them was there. Only if they attempted to board the ship would they have realized that something was wrong\u2026 and then, not for very long.", "A liquid, chittering giggle pulsed through Bathory\u2019s mind as the Naiad slid far enough out-system to submerge herself into the Current like the insect-ship she appeared to be. The young predator ignored the scraping, chirping, disgusting songless static of deadtone speech that filled this infested system. She was having too much fun to pay attention to that.", "She had been told to watch and to report anything that was worthy of the Spears\u2019 attention. The Spearsong was dealing with a minor infestation elsewhere in this region, while the Skintaker rested close by and waited for her report. The decision to accompany the Spears had been an easy one for Bathory and her brood-mates; new things to see, to experience, new songs to hear and more. She was glad that her mother-queen had decided to allow it. She wasn\u2019t sure why, but she hadn\u2019t pressed too deeply.", "The Spears, strange creatures that they were, were fascinating. She could understand why her older sisters had been so willing to let the Spearsong bring them to a new hunting ground. It was still hard to grapple with the idea that the alien monarchs had been built, not birthed\u2026 and built by the deadtone, no less. It was an aberrant concept. Repulsive. But still\u2026 fascinating.", "Counting her travel with the Skintaker, this was the young Naiad\u2019s second expedition beyond the borders of her home and the first time within an insect hive. There was more traffic and more construction than in any other system she had seen, including her pack\u2019s birthing grounds. Naiads cared little for the deadtone, the insects that spewed and heaved themselves across the Ocean. They were beneath notice\u2026 but Bathory saw them now, and she was not pleased. It was repugnant, awe-inspiring\u2026 and disturbing. So many ugly, lowing deadtone constructs, worlds being devoured by their tiny, gnawing mouths and everywhere, the squirming, squeaking toneless chitters of insects, like maggots crawling on flesh.", "The Naiad adolescent watched the repellant prey-monarch depart the system. She had stayed well clear of the deadtone\u2019s cordon, but one of her brood mites had been able to slip close enough to watch the monarch hurl itself into the Current with all the grace and \u00e9lan of an asteroid crashing into a sea. A vector was pulled and the mite returned to its Naiad host, carrying the information with it.", "Clad in the flesh of the dead, a young, eager predator prepared to cross the boundary between realms. The departure of a deadtone monarch \u2013 or whatever name the insects gave to such things \u2013 and its destination was certainly worth reporting.", "With a ripple of silent amusement, the creature called Bathory disappeared from the Ocean, submerging herself into the Current, hurrying to offer this information to a Spear, a monarch-that-was-built. This was all such delightful fun. She wanted to hear more poetry wrought with burning metal and the screams of insects. It was a pleasant melody. She couldn\u2019t wait to hear more of it.", "She couldn\u2019t wait for the killing to start.", "~", "The missive had been brief. Terse, to the point and still loaded with a considerable amount of anger. Adrianna could empathize; in the Noble Lord\u2019s place, she\u2019d be no happier. Probably less.

They had strategized and organized on the assumption that Natuous was the Red Hand\u2019s sole target. Adrianna\u2019s decision had caught them as much by surprise as their mutual enemy. It was not, as the message said, appropriate to switch venues at the last minute when much of the caterer\u2019s work had already been done.

Three days had passed, closing on four. Every hour that passed meant in Galhemna another defence platform came on-line, another warship was readied for battle and the odds became stacked against them that much further. Still, they waited.", "Adrianna slept, ate, exercised, strategized, planned and tried to relax where she could. Some commanders might keep themselves on edge, but she had learned a long time ago that a fleet leader running on adrenalin and stimulants was no substitute for a fresh, well-rested mind. Still. She hated waiting, so she paced.", "It wasn\u2019t the thing an officer should do. It showed impatience, anxiousness, uncertainty. Her crew was long used to it, and they\u2019d learned to pay no attention to their queen\u2019s occasional restlessness. If they could accept a Broken leading them, then another one of her eccentricities was no problem at all. It still bothered her, though.", "She\u2019d tried occasionally to keep herself still, but like a habitual drunk reaching for a bottle, Adrianna all too often found herself circling her command deck. She was infinitely patient when something actually happened, during hours or days-long maneuvers against enemy forces, when she was indulging in her hobbies. She\u2019d learned how to build electronics and clockwork devices sitting in her father\u2019s lap, watching as he silently and carefully attached circuits or installed tiny gears. She\u2019d also spent days digging through the dust of worlds, looking for relics thought lost to the past. She didn\u2019t do much of that these days. She could be patient.

One of them had just reported in.", "Adrianna watched the data. She smiled slowly. Close to a hundred warships were leaving Galhemna. The scout had been unable to pull a vector, but she knew where they were headed. Natuous. Adrianna had no idea what was happening in the other system, but she could guess. The sector\u2019s overseers and corporate oligarchs hadn\u2019t been able to contain Nameless\u2019s assault and they were screaming for reinforcements. Bastion Leader Kemk, being a dutiful and loyal son of the Compact, was sending the ships he could spare. Possibly even more than that.", "\u201cReady the fleet,\u201d Adrianna said. The data was time-lapsed and she watched as dozens of ship markers crossed Galhemna\u2019s shock limit and vanish on their way to Natuous.

Any other vessel would have died making that warp jump and as it was, Echo had damaged her ship-self in doing so. Not as bad as when she\u2019d jumped deep into Sol to confront her sibling.

One remained a three-jawed broadsword, all slopes, angles and dark silver. The other\u2019s alien curves had been broken up with heavy armour banding, weapons batteries and her hull was the colour of charcoal. Still, there were traces of commonality, hints of a shared lineage despite their differences. The lines of Hekate\u2019s blockier modifications harkened to Nemesis\u2019s design.

The former was hard enough with six hundred vessels, most with shock systems of less-than-modern-military-spec. To do it with twelve hundred was exponentially more difficult. Besides, Galhemna wasn\u2019t expecting an attack. They would be on edge, but they wouldn\u2019t be creating a death ground for the armada to fly into like at Natuous. They didn\u2019t know they had to. The more time the Red Hand gave Kemk to react, the bloodier this would become and the worse it would go.", "An ecliptic approach had its own benefits; less interference from planetary bodies, less obstruction. In some cases, it was best when making a strike on a particular, specific asset within a star system, but it was Galhemna\u2019s many planetary bodies and the ships, stations and centers of industrial production around them that were Adrianna\u2019s targets.", "That was why eight dozen ships had to die.", "As soon as those vessels returned to realspace, their skeleton crews performed a final task before rushing to hangars and escape pods. Across millions of kilometers, thousands of weapons platforms stirred to life. Unlike the arrival of Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro, this mass arrival was neither expected, nor did any of the ships possess proper IFFs or security codes. A hostile response was immediately initiated. The control platforms and pickets did nothing to stop it. This wasn\u2019t an unexpected arrival of friendly ships or a wayward convoy.", "Somnolent weapons platforms came to life. Attack drones ignited their engines, missile platforms oriented towards the newcomers. The backwash of shock energy made the vessels difficult to lock onto, but their vulnerability more than made up for that. Blind, their screens down and not under thrust, those hundred vessels were perfect targets.", "Scanner systems snapped to life, pushing through the energy venting from invading ships. Machine minds began running calculations, preparing fire patterns and analyzing threat levels for a proportional response. The concept of using expendable vessels to sweep a minefield was not new; in fact, it was one that most platforms had a pre-programmed counter to, requiring no organic input whatsoever. Unless directed otherwise, modern minefields would not waste themselves on targets of minimal offensive capability. Under most circumstances, a freighter, even a hundred of them, more than qualified as that. Enough ordnance to zero the potential threat would be expended, and no more. But instead of harmless freighters, those vessels read as battleships.", "Their hulls had been reinforced, modified with scrap and even painted to give them the general silhouette of Argosy heavy capital ships. Additional reactors had been crammed aboard the freighters to boost their energy emissions, their output tweaked to emulate the profile of an Argosy vessel. At best, the deception was crude. It wouldn\u2019t fool anyone for long, if at all\u2026 in any other circumstance. With the massive amounts of radiation venting from the freighters confounding hostile scopes, for several vital moments those vessels did indeed appear to be enemy battleships, the forward van of an attacking fleet.", "The minefield surged to life, thousands of platforms activated by what they believed they were seeing. As the Red Hand ships wallowed helplessly, the attack began. Energy platforms fired, laser beams cutting through armour and mines tearing gaping chasms through reinforced hulls. Despite their modifications, the freighters would survive minutes at best \u2026 but they had never been intended to survive. They would die, but in doing so, they would offer a final gift.", "Every cubic meter aboard those ships not given over to essential systems and furthering their deception had been packed with attack drones. There\u2019d been no time to convert them into carriers; they had no hangars, only charges set on their exterior hulls to blow open egress. The automatons boiled out of their host ships, as blind to their surroundings as the freighters themselves. They collided with each other, with the vessels that had launched them and died in droves as mines and missiles came in, plumes of fire hotter than a star blotting droves of them away as the freighters died around them.", "Hundreds more survived and as their own systems stabilized, they set to work. The attack drones were crude, after-market, stolen corporate or built within swamp nests, but like the freighters themselves, they didn\u2019t need to be more than that. They were small, with a short operational life, and a near-complete inability to threaten anything more than the smallest of vessels\u2026 but starships were not their targets.", "Dozens of mines were wiped away as the drones swarmed into attack range, the wreckage of burning starships behind them. Dozens became hundreds and the invaders\u2019 intent became clear. Lacking minesweepers or ships strong enough to endure a prolonged bombardment while they lay helpless, the Red Hand had baited the mines into revealing themselves, expending ordnance on worthless hulls and marking their positions for the hunter-killers to backtrack. Datalinks went dead as control nodes were destroyed, energy mines were sniped with interceptor missiles and launch platforms were shredded by laser fire and autocannon.", "Recognizing the threat for what it was, the minefield\u2019s pickets moved in, defensive missiles and point-defences winnowing the drone swarm, but it wasn\u2019t enough. The attackers ignored the vessels killing them. It was the mines that mattered and the hunter-killers reaped their way through the field.", "Twenty-three minutes after the arrival of the freighters, all ninety-four ships had been neutralized and every attack drone had been destroyed. Less than one in seven of the transports\u2019 escape craft would be recovered, but the crews had accomplished their mission. They\u2019d ripped a hole in the minefield almost large enough for a fleet. The Compact recognized the danger. Alerts were sent across Galhemna. Minelayers were summoned, defence squadrons were called to battle stations and the word of the attack began to spread as fast as radio waves would carry it. The pickets knew that those dozens of vessels hadn\u2019t died for nothing. Even so, they were unprepared for the scale of what came next.", "Twenty-eight minutes after the sweeper threat had been neutralized, more than eleven hundred vessels made a synchronized mass shock into Galhemna. A handful were lost to mines and pickets, but far fewer than would have been destroyed had the Compact\u2019s defence lines remained intact. Today\u2019s first sacrifice: ships that could not fight for the ones that could. The first sacrifice\u2026 but not the last.", "Aboard Eisheth, Adrianna looked at the faded grey contact markers, all that remained of the nearby pickets. Tonne for tonne, few if any of her armada were a match for the Compact Space Force\u2026 but quantity was a quality all its own. \u201cAs we discussed,\u201d she said, baring her teeth. \u201cFormations One and Two on the flanks. Let\u2019s be about it.\u201d She ran her thumb over the violet flame pattern on her uniform\u2019s cuffs. This is for you, Andrew.", "Operation Twenty Pearls had well and truly begun.

The task force was scouring the system, destroying everything that they came across. There were still ambushes and ordnance in plenty, but losses were far below those suffered in Husk.

The destruction of the renegade Chariot qualified for such a thing, but it was a somber, reserved affair and Nasham had felt no inclination to join in. Vinsea hadn\u2019t suggested it, either.

She regarded him with her other three eyes. \u201cThat you\u2019re not paranoid enough.\u201d", "Nasham paused with a skewer of something that tasted almost exactly like meat hovering next to his mouth. \u201cAh?\u201d", "Vinsea balanced the fork, tines down, on the table\u2019s surface. \u201cYou were an assignment,\u201d she told him. \u201cI think I was quite clear about that. I wasn\u2019t here to be your friend or get into your bed. I was here to make sure you didn\u2019t go off the path and you weren\u2019t a threat to anyone here, even yourself. There were a few times that I thought you might be, but every time you\u2019ve managed to right yourself. The Bastion Leader didn\u2019t like you or trust you. She still doesn\u2019t like you, but now? She trusts you. A junior officer, dining at her table, offering his thoughts to her? She has access to two thousand years of data on our quarry, from after-action strategic analyses to the records of battles as they happened. And she still wants your opinion.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2026 had noticed that,\u201d Nasham admitted. He supposed many other officers would have taken it as a point of pride for such an exalted member of the Space Force to call upon them, but he had never entertained that notion. He knew his words had never made a decision for the Bastion Leader, but twice she\u2019d asked \u2013 perhaps testing, perhaps not \u2013 for his thoughts to see how they aligned with hers.", "\u201cAnd did you also notice that the rest of the staff don\u2019t treat you as they once did? You are still annoying, presumptuous and often less than a scratch\u2019s width from insubordinate, but they at least listen to you now. Even if they don\u2019t like you. You haven\u2019t just head our target speak; you\u2019ve talked to it. That makes you a concern, but it also means you know it better than any other person alive.\u201d", "She pointed her fork at him. \u201cChameleon\u2019s Gaze,\u201d Vinsea continued. \u201c1893-Yiren. Hursk. Wake of Futures. The traitor Broken, and the possibility of more. You have made good decisions and had helpful insights. More than once. More than luck would allow. So,\u201d the young woman finished. \u201cI think you should be paranoid.\u201d", "Nasham was silent for several moments. \u201cOn Invida, she laid siege to the colony,\u201d he began. \u201cShe diverted the bulk of our garrison with feints before her engines broke the walls. In Terrahope, she feigned death, letting us repair her while she sowed dissonance. She\u2019s told two thousand years of lies and every time we believe we have pierced them, we are the ones bleeding.\u201d", "\u201cThere have been a few genuine victories along the way,\u201d Vinsea reminded Nasham, once again playing her role. The Compact had come close to destroying the Wound more than once. It was more than possible for them to succeed. Not everything was a trap or a hidden agenda.", "He dipped his head in acknowledgment. \u201cThis is not one of them,\u201d he asserted, giving voice to the whispers of ill-fortune that were running through his head. He didn\u2019t know how accurate or rational they were. He hoped not at all. \u201cShe came to Invida for the Echo. It slaughtered Execution Force Renan for her. She would not abandon it. She is not a coldly emotionless device. She is not like the drones we have been destroying. She feels.\u201d He\u2019d heard the hate in the machine\u2019s voice when it spoke to him. It had whispered its rage as it murdered ships and burned worlds. It wasn\u2019t replicating emotions it didn\u2019t have. The machine felt. If it could feel hatred, fury, revulsion\u2026 why not the opposite of those? That was almost more frightening.", "\u201cMaybe it had no choice. Maybe it had another mission.\u201d", "\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Nasham conceded. \u201cBut as I said\u2026 two thousand years of lies. Decades-long campaigns of deception. It has out-fought and out-thought us for twenty centuries. Why are we presuming we have done so now? The nebula, to Husk, to here. All very logical, rational and possible. A chain of circumstance, ambushes and fortune, one forged in months, not years. I am looking at our presence here, and I remember standing upon her decks. We were in total control then. Until we realized we never had been. So I see this system, the ruin of her navy, the corpse of her sibling and I have to wonder\u2026 why did she want us to come here? That is what my paranoia says to me. This is not a victory; it is an invitation to her hearth.\u201d", "Vinsea was quiet. The intelligence officer was mulling possibilities, trying to come up with a reason why their enemy would want to bait the Compact into destroying everything it had, but she could think of nothing that made sense\u2026 and that, more than anything else, was concerning. \u201cThen I hope you not mind my saying, dear ullanu,\u201d she said with soft formality, \u201cthat I hope you are very paranoid.\u201d", "\u201cIn less than a day, we will be on final approach to the construct,\u201d Nasham noted. \u201cI suppose we will find out then.\u201d", "~", "Brightest Night sailed through the conflagration, weapons blazing. It flitted past a Compact destroyer, the larger vessel bulging with blossoms of fire as the corvette\u2019s laser batteries sunk deep and turned chunks of its hull to atomic vapour. The smaller ship didn\u2019t even slow down, leaving the stricken vessel to one of its dozens of allies. The rest of the Unbound armada swept around the burning destroyer, each Red Hand vessel getting off a handful of shots before they were out of weapons range, the slowly spinning wreck dying from hundreds of cuts. It wasn\u2019t alone. Four more of its kin, slashed and shredded into darkened hulks, drifted through the middle of the attack force.", "There were nearly three hundred ships in this arm of the fleet, simply and directly called Group One. Hundreds of thousands of kilometers away, Group Two mirrored their actions, a flying column that overran everything in its path. Between them, the heaviest vessels of the Red Hand fleet cruised along in stately belligerence. As soon as One or Two ran into trouble, dozens of them would peel away to engage it, freeing up the lighter corsairs and brigands to continue their raiding.", "Group Four were the support vessels and their escorts; colliers, repair and recovery tugs, assault ships and anything not considered suitable for front-line combat.", "So far, the brazenness of the Red Hand assault had caught Galhemna by surprise. They had expected a strike at Natuous, and Crusade Commander Nameless\u2019s operation had not disappointed them. She was to do what damage she could, to force the Compact to reinforce the system. She\u2019d done that. Galhemna was the closest, strongest system. There\u2019d been no question that additional support would come from here. The fortress system was strong enough that even the departure of several dozen warships hadn\u2019t made it anything approaching an easy mark\u2026 but slightly weaker was still weaker, and those ships had come from the outer system, where the Red Hand was fighting now.", "Nearly three dozen Space Force warships had already been destroyed or incapacitated, with the rate of exchange actually slightly in the Red Hand\u2019s favour. Despite their shortcomings, the sheer number of pirate ships meant only the heaviest salvos had a chance of breaching their defences. Small units of pickets and outer-system patrol groups didn\u2019t have that kind of firepower, and the few that did found themselves facing Eisheth and the Red Hand\u2019s elite.", "Compounding the Compact\u2019s woes was the panic spreading through civilian shipping. Hundreds of freighters, transports, passenger lines, shuttles and spacecraft were plying through Galhemna\u2019s outermost reaches and quite a few of those were within striking distance of the Red Hand armada. They were scrambling in all directions; some were racing out-system, some were fleeing for the nearest Compact positions, others were assembling into groups, hoping for safety in numbers\u2026 and all of them were calling for help. Even some of those not directly threatened were screaming for assistance, ship leaders, corporate executives, civilian administrators all insisting that their vessels receive priority.", "Fourteen transports had already been disabled, several of those had already been captured, either forcibly or bowing to the inevitable. A few others were still trying to hold off the Red Hand\u2019s boarding teams, but a civilian transport\u2019s security forces would find it difficult to overcome any determined assault, let alone one from experienced shipjackers. A few of those vessels were already moving towards Group Four, either under tow or their own power. If they were spaceworthy, those ships would be added to the Red Hand\u2019s fleet, or ransomed back to their companies, along with the leader and any sufficiently important personnel. The rest of the crews\u2026 well, there were already a number of shuttles departing the transports. They\u2019d be cramped and uncomfortable, but they wouldn\u2019t spend the next few months enjoying Red Hand hospitality as their employers and insurance companies haggled for their release. The Compact might not negotiate with terrorists, but for those who did, paying a ransom was cheaper and easier than building a new ship or writing off an experienced officer.", "It hardly made up for the losses the insurgency had already suffered, but it was a start.", "Grace ran her tongue over her lips. From the outside, it might seem like the Red Hand was winning handily, but that was only appearance. News of their arrival hadn\u2019t even reached the farthest parts of the system. The response they\u2019d gotten so far had been fragmentary, isolated pockets and patrol squadrons acting on their own initiative, but Galhmena\u2019s defenders were rallying as word reached them. The warships closest to the Red Hand armada were falling back, accelerating hard to keep out of the swarm\u2019s missile ranges. Grace listened to the cheers and taunts from her fellows in Groups One and Two, but she ignored them. The senior leaders of Three said nothing. They knew what Grace did; that was not a retreat. It was a regrouping.", "Despite the occasional exception, the Space Force was not staffed by idiots. Those pickets knew that in their current numbers, they would be overwhelmed by the insurgent armada one squadron after another. They weren\u2019t prepared to die for vainglory or because withdrawing from pirates might \u2018dishonour\u2019 them. They weren\u2019t going to throw their lives away to no benefit. They couldn\u2019t stop nor slow the Unbound armada, so they ran in order to support the inevitable counter-attack.", "Retribution was coming. Squadrons of capital ships, defence monitors, gunships and attack drones were already shifting position, coming onto new courses. The soft blue-green swell of Kanlie, Galhemna\u2019s seventh world, lay ahead. It had brilliant, large rings, a spectacle that tourists and civilians enjoyed visiting\u2026 and it was where the bulk of the system\u2019s gas mining was done. Forty-three moons circled the world, and nearly triple that number of refineries, extraction facilities, storage containers, shipwombs and docks filled its orbital pathways.", "Defensive citadels, minefields and three dozen monitors protected the world. The outer-system pickets were falling back towards Kanlie, and the closest inner-system patrols were moving towards the planet. By the time Group One reached it, the planet would have a force that equaled their own numbers and outweighed them in firepower.", "Several squadrons were not headed towards their fellows; their course was taking them to the planet\u2019s libation points, where they intended to shock out and drop behind the Red Hand forces, penning them in for slaughter.  Hundreds more ships from deeper in the system had mobilized and many of them would do the same, some risking the in-system jumps, while others charged up the gravity well at sublight.", "They\u2019d stuck the bear and now, it was turning to face them with murder in its eyes.", "Grace slumped back into her chair. There were no more active enemy contacts in the immediate area. She felt clammy. Her forehead was damp, and her uniform stuck to her in several places. She hadn\u2019t fucked up so far. It was still possible, but she was trying to maintain an aura of confidence. She thought of Adrianna and the way she affected an arrogant, casual slouch, looking ultimately confident in her decisions. She thought of Allyria and felt a pang. It had been months since they\u2019d last seen each other. They\u2019d never been separated for this long. Even when one or the other got her back up after a fight, they\u2019d only sulked for a few days, maybe a week or two.", "She\u2019d been hoping to take the last shipment to Shuruppak herself, but Adrianna had needed her here. Grace was the only one who could speak for Red \u2013 even if Adrianna had impressed upon her that making agreements in the AI\u2019s stead was a bad habit to get into \u2013 if the Principality needed further assurances. Nemesis had sent a drone; Adrianna had informed her of Twenty Pearls, but Red\u2019s message was very succinct:", "Coming was all it said. Grace understood why. The risk of something slipping was too high, but she\u2019d been hoping for some news from Allyria. She\u2019d sent a message with each shipment, some a little more personal than others and had been looking forward to seeing Ally again \u2013 even if meant being called \u2018Gra\u2019. She smiled a little at the memory, brushed a little wetness from the corner of her eye and put her mind back on the battle.", "She\u2019s coming, the young woman reminded herseld. She\u2019s coming. But I hope she gets here soon. She bit the inside of her cheek as she took in all the threat markers on the master tactical map and the very deliberate way that they were moving as they prepared to dole out retribution towards the pirate fleet that had dared attack them.", "No, thought Grace, the battle only looked like it was going their way.", "It was going to get much worse very soon.", "~", "Tens of thousands of kilometers above Kanlie\u2019s serene turquoise clouds a hundred vessels readied themselves for battle: defence monitors, corporate security vessels and Space Force warships, more than enough to easily see off the entirety of Group One and much of Two, blunting the Red Hand assault. Quantity mattered; so did quality and the simple, unavoidable fact remained that for all their discipline, devotion and skill, the military wing of the Red Hand were still lagged behind their enemies in those same categories.", "Insurgency problems, Adrianna thought wryly. You can try to be a real military, but you\u2019ll never quite succeed. Forget that, and you end up doing something stupid like taking on an enemy fortress system with nothing but a bunch of idealists and pirates. \u201cGroup One and Two, begin deceleration. Keep outside the PNR. I want Three to match their thrust. Keep us the mouth of the beast.\u201d It was a simple formation, common across dozens of cultures over thousands of years, and hard to screw up. In certain military texts, it was called \u2018the Horned Maw\u2019; outrider columns raced ahead of the heaviest elements, ready to fall back if they encountered heavy opposition, or funnel enemies into the \u2018mouth\u2019 where they could be chewed up by elite units.", "The order went out. Minutes passed and as the hundreds of ships received and carried out their directives, the formations began to slow; thruster arrays firing and primary engines dampened, ships flipping to abate their momentum. This was the most dangerous part of the operation, when her fleet was at its most vulnerable. They were slowing down, making themselves easier targets. To an observer, it looked as if the Red Hand was preparing to withdraw, or at least reconsidering meeting the massed firepower of Kanlie head-on.", "A more aggressive commander would have immediately taken advantage of the situation, coming out to engage the Red Hand. Compact officers were traditionally very aggressive, but this was Kemk\u2019s backyard. Whoever was in charge of that ad hoc armada wasn\u2019t going to rush out at the first opportunity. Not before they were ready. Even the Red Hand\u2019s ships could exact a butcher\u2019s price on a disordered or ill-prepared charge. She would have done the same thing.", "Adrianna could see the Compact vessels shifting position, fortresses adjusting their courses as if they were preparing to move into the vacant space around the gas giant\u2019s orbitals. A sally was definitely being considered. She looked at the system map. More warships were on their way, burning hard to get to grips with her forces. Some were holding position near libration points. They weren\u2019t going to jump though, not until they could pin her between themselves and the ships racing up the gravity well. If they acted too soon, her force could either fall back around them, or slip away before the rest of the Galhemnan garrison could bring her to battle. If they waited too long, she would have time to break away before engaging the latter.", "Timing was everything. In battles that lasted days and were waged across entire star systems, all too often, the outcome came down to what transpired in a scant few minutes, or even less.", "Adrianna stood, circling the bridge and feeling annoyed with herself for doing so. She ameliorated that by stopping at each station to look at the officers\u2019 raw data feeds and telling herself she was actually doing something. The woman stopped at the main sensor board, blue eyes flicking back and forth. She was watching the movement, disposition and strength of the Compact forces. They were coming to her, just as she\u2019d known they were. Not just a few, not just the ones closest to her fleet. All of Galhemna was mobilizing. She\u2019d thrown a rock right into a hornet\u2019s nest, and they were very pissed. Kemk wasn\u2019t going to let her get away. It wasn\u2019t just professional for him. It was personal, too. She\u2019d never met the Bastion Leader and she\u2019d only crossed his path by fighting his subordinates, but she knew why he hated her so much.", "Minutes ticked by, one after the other after the other. Adrianna paced a little more, then sat back in her chair. She ordered the fleet to change course. It would look like they were attempting to circumnavigate Kanlie, intending to slip by its defenders and wreak further havoc before they could be caught. She\u2019d dangled the hook\u2026", "\u2026and the fish took a bite.", "A hundred ships surged towards Adrianna\u2019s fleet, away from the planet and its defences. Alerts sounded as the fleet\u2019s augurs picked up multiple shockpoints behind them. The first part of the enemy\u2019s sally was in position. The second was on its way; the outer system garrison was creating a net surrounding Kanlie hundreds of starships strong. They weren\u2019t going to let her get away. Squadrons behind, squadrons ahead, the forts and minefields of Kanlie. Hundreds of ships and thousands upon thousands of men and women whose only goal was to kill her. Frigates, destroyers, light capitals, battlecruisers and even a few battleships. Each and every soul aboard those countless millions of tonnes of armour and guns wanted her dead and was doing everything in their power to make it happen.", "Her lips twitched in a cold, tight smile.", "Another one of those tiny moments when the fate of the battle would be decided was here. The Compact had made their window. Adrianna looked over at her Operations officer and nodded. \u201cThe guests are here. It would be rude to make them wait for dinner.\u201d A message went out. A single ship detached from Group Four and shocked away. It wasn\u2019t going to go far. Less than a light-year.", "More minutes passed. Ten, then twenty. The Compact net was tightening, surrounding the smaller Red hand vessels like sharks closing in on a school of bait fish. The tension aboard the fleet rose. The closest of the Space Force elements were less than thirty minutes away from missile range. Once they reached it, they would have a shooting gallery.", "Then, Adrianna\u2019s moment arrived and with it, the tide of battle shifted for the second time today.", "Six hundred ships ripped their way into Galhemna. These were not the Red Hand\u2019s mishmash of sizes, shapes and colours.  The newcomers were much more uniform in design. Hooked beaks of prows, elongated bodies, massive forward-swept wings filled with equally large weapons. A third of those vessels were escorts, another third were light capitals. The remainder were battlecruisers and battleships. Capping off the fleet were two massive, precious supercarriers. The drone platform Purgebringer and the missile carrier Exsanguinator. Wraith Fleet Severance, launched from Kebrak Daun under command of Noble Fleet Lord Jirrico of House Soton-ra.", "The plan, as the Principality had agreed to it, had been for the Red Hand to strike at Natuous, to decapitate the Compact\u2019s leadership and draw away Galhemna\u2019s garrison. Severance, supported by the promised arrival of Chrysalis, would attack Galhemna directly, gutting Sundial before it could be born. Instead, the Red Queen had divided her forces, sending the smaller element to Natuous. Jirrico hadn\u2019t been happy, but Leblanc had made a passionate case for Twenty Pearls, and the plan had already been in motion, so Jirrico found himself fighting alongside the Red Hand. Publicly. Not an idea situation, but it had been too late to back out, and he had to admit\u2026 the Broken was capable enough.", "Standing on Exsanguinator\u2019s command deck, watching the liquid metal displays form and solidify as the supercarrier\u2019s sensors cleared and it could behold its surroundings, Jirrico allowed himself a wide, toothed grin. In his people, the gesture was a sign of aggression and threat. It matched how he felt. The Argosy was supposed to strike at a much-depleted Galhemna, killing ships still in their docks and obliterating the industry that built them, supported by Chrysalis. Apparently, the Red Queen had had either ideas... and the neverborn was not here.", "Despite it at, the Renegade monarch had done what she\u2019d promised. The outer-system forces had been drawn out of position. They\u2019d planned to encircle and destroy the Renegade forces and in doing so, presented themselves to him.", "\u201cWeapons free,\u201d he ordered. The battle for Galhemna wasn\u2019t close to over, though. The Compact garrison still outnumbered his and outgunned the Red Hand\u2019s. He might be able to win this, but they still needed Chrysalis.", "I hope you know what we\u2019re all doing, he silently thought to the machine\u2019s servants, wherever they might be in that glittering morass of emission patterns and weapons fire. I hope your neverborn mistress arrives\u2026 and I hope that whatever the rains have delivered to us is beneficent.", "~", "I can still taste the radioactive death spasms of the Kaiju. I don\u2019t have a benchmark to truly compare it to, but I believe the closest analogy would be that it is like\u2026 \u2018champagne bubbles on my tongue\u2019. It\u2019s been too long since I\u2019ve killed a Compact dreadnought\u2026 and the last time I hunted with another Confederate ship was two thousand years ago.", "My sister is immeasurably pleased with herself. She should be. She\u2019s killed two fleets already, but there is something special about destroying a Kaiju.

It feels familiar. It\u2019s liquid and writhing, deep and pure. We both know what it is.", "Earth burned. So will Galhemna. No mercy. No quarter.

Missiles flashed between the armadas, the flanking Compact squadrons firing on every target they could as Wraith Fleet Severance spread into an englobing formation, doing to them what only minutes before they had planned to do to the Red Hand. At first, only the fastest and lightest Askanj warships entered attack range, and they were still outgunned, but it took less than twenty minutes before enough of the Principality warships were in range that the balance shifted from the Compact\u2019s favour, to the Askanj matching them salvo for salvo, to outgunning them. The defenders were outnumbered more than six to one, and the Argosy fleet was taking full advantage of that disparity. Jirrico had no intention of letting this attack force escape to reinforce the rest of the garrison later.", "Adrianna\u2019s eyes shone as she gave orders, her own armada turning away from their previous course. They left damaged and crippled starships their wake as Compact augurs locked onto them and missiles lanced through their lines, hammering starships into air-bleeding wrecks, scrap or even less than that. Despite that, the Red Hand\u2019s losses were minimal. The Space Force had far larger concerns at the moment. They were taking targets of opportunity rather than a dedicated effort to engage Leblanc\u2019s forces. It was Jirrico\u2019s armada that was the greatest threat; the Red Hand was heavily outgunned by Galhemna\u2019s garrison and without support, they would be unable to do more than grazing strikes on isolated outer-system assets before being run off, or ensnared and destroyed.", "Now\u2026 now they had that support, even if those providing it were doing so with gritted teeth.", "Too bad. The Principality had been dealing with the Red Hand at a distance for too long. Now, they\u2019d have to either openly and fully support the Red Hand\u2019s fight, or cut ties\u2026 and Adrianna knew they couldn\u2019t do that. Even if Operation Hatchling went perfectly, the Askanj would still need every ally that they could get, especially to take advantage of a weakened Compact. The revolutionary smiled at the thought, running one slender finger along the edge of her armrest as she watched the shifting tactical display. The Principality battle fleet was accelerating directly towards the Compact squadrons, with little attempt to jockey for position. Compact warships were faster and more maneuverable; their preferred method was to wear down Argosy forces with heavy broadsides, before driving into the heart of an opposing fleet, using their speed, armour and firepower to break the Principality lines. It was a very direct tactic, but that made it no less effective.", "The Argosy preferred chase armament to broadsides, front-loading their vessels with a heavy arsenal at the cost of fewer weapons along their ships\u2019 flanks and spines. Their elegant raptorial wings carried forward and aft-mounted batteries, missile silos and torpedo tubes in addition to thruster arrays, comm antennae and sensor nodes. Their advanced computer systems provided accuracy and targeting that few Compact warships could match, but that was not the advantage it might appear to be. The Compact remained the premier shipbuilders in known space, though the Principality constantly tested that claim and they were quick to capitalize whenever it fell short.", "Coilguns hurled metal slugs towards the Compact lines, analytical systems and targeting telemetry straining to pick out targets through intense jamming as Principality officers and computers attempted to predict the evasive movements of their foes. Where they guessed correctly, screens flared as c-fractional mass rounds struck home. It wasn\u2019t only the Askanj fleet\u2019s fire that had any effect. The entrapped Compact warships fought bitterly and valiantly.", "Missiles bobbed and weaved in attack runs, hundreds of warheads immolated by interceptors and point defence fire, but dozens slipped through. Directed cones of annihilation reached out, caressing starships with world-scouring power. Screens weakened. Barriers collapsed. Brightly-coloured warbirds shuddered and went dark as their defences were overcome. Earthern-hued predators shattered as their armoured hulls buckled and broke.", "Upon Exsanguinator, Jirrico\u2019s crests were swollen and aching with instinctive aggression as he watched his fleet sweep aside squadron after squadron, opening a hole in the enemy\u2019s formation through which the Red Hand armada poured. They could have stayed and fought; no longer surrounded, they could have used their numbers to overcome the sunward defenders. It was tempting to call that cowardice, but he would have made the same decision. Why bleed themselves, when they had the support of a larger, more capable force to assist them? Still, it meant that the surviving Compact ships were free to disengage, falling back to Kanlie or to other rally points deeper in-system.", "As soon as they were out of direct fire, the Renegades began regrouping in preparation for the next assault with a rapidity out of the norm for such creatures. By the Noble Fleet Lord\u2019s military standards, it was lacking. By the standards of the rest of their ilk, it might as well have been parade-ground perfect. His fleet was attempting to tap into their command net. So far, they\u2019d had little luck. The range was too long, the Red Hand\u2019s encryption too strong. The few ships that broke comm discipline were quickly noticed and remonstrated by their fellows.", "He let out a breath as he touched his crests, trying to release some of the tension in his body. He\u2019d had to commit Severance to Galhemna alongside the Red Hand, a public and unequivocal statement of the Principality\u2019s association with the insurgents. That was\u2026 not as planned, but it had been too late to do anything about it. Galhemna must fall. Now, before Sundial was ready.", "In the wake of this assault, the Red Hand would be severely weakened. The Triarchs\u2019 hounds\u2019 would be after them with a fanaticism that made their earlier efforts seem half-hearted. There were also those Renegades who would gladly take the opportunity to drive a spear into an injured competitor, whether to take what they had or remove a threat to their own power. But if it were publicly known that the Red Hand had very powerful patrons, the latter would reconsider such a move and the former would have to tread cautiously, balancing their need to destroy the rebels against the possibility of their anti-pirate forces encountering foes that they were not prepared to handle.", "More so, the Red Hand\u2019s connections and reach would be invaluable in keeping the Compact off-balance after Sundial\u2019s failure. To do that, they would need an influx of supplies and other resources. The Red Queen had committed a lot to this endeavour. She and hers were pirates, terrorists and Renegades, but to abandon them would be dishonourable.", "The Principality would have to stand alongside the Renegades. Yes, well, despite the arms, advisors, largesse and succor we\u2019ve provided over the years, we just so happened to coordinate our actions to strike at our mutual enemy on the same timetable, and then a Broken pirate tricked us into openly supporting her operations but we\u2019re not really allied, was a dubious rationalization at best. A state\u2019s public image could survive an admission of amoral self-interest, confessing to abandoning an ally \u2013 less so. Even worse would be any intimation that they\u2019d been duped by the lowest strata of society, and the lowest of the Compact\u2019s helot races at that\u2026", "So the Askanj Principality was now going to openly support a Renegade force. If Jirrico were the kind of man to believe in Ancestor Spirits, he could only hope that they would not judge him too harshly for this. Still, he had to admit that the Red Queen played the game well. She\u2019d maneuvered him well enough, and her armada was doing better than he\u2019d imagined, with lighter losses than his staff had projected. She\u2019d successfully drawn the Compact\u2019s defenders into a killing field for him.", "It was easy to be optimistic. The first turn of battle had been for Operation Hatchling, but there were still hundreds more defenders waiting, ready and eager. Last count had upwards of a thousand operational Space Force assets and system monitors, with hundreds more defence platforms, palisades, minefields and batteries waiting for them. Galhemna was not unprotected. It was only the first trench that lay before them.", "As his task force finished the destruction of the outer entrapping squadrons and the inner ones fell back to Kanlie, Jirrico ordered his fleet to prepare for a planetary siege. He would make this as quick as he could. Neither he nor the Red Queen could risk becoming bogged down when the Compact reinforcements arrived.", "At least we got here before those Chariots came on-line.", "~", "Bastion Leader Kemk stood on the upper level of Sacrament of Iron\u2019s command deck, observing the tactical displays. He had a cup of cold tea in one hand. The situation had rapidly turned from unexpected, to unpleasant, to optimistic and back to unpleasant. The data he was receiving was several hours old; what he was seeing was the past, irrevocable and unalterable. He watched as Column Leader Prime Eran\u2019ta dispersed her ships to envelop the Unbound attackers, positioning dozens of her vessels at key points to block off any hope of their retreat. It was a Writ-perfect response to this kind of attack. He knew that\u2026 and he knew the never-sufficiently-damned-to-the-Black Broken \u201cmonarch\u201d did, too. Eran\u2019ta was \u2013 had been \u2013 a good officer, but one very fond of procedure and policy.", "He saw the gambit unveil before it happened, every fiber of him wishing he could cast a warning across the light-hours and change what was about to unfold, but there was nothing he could do. Irrevocable and unalterable. Instead, he remained where he was and took another sip of his chilled drink as the hauma Red Hand feigned hesitancy and weakness, Eran\u2019ta\u2019s vanguard shocked out to the very locations he would have selected for just such an engulfing maneuver\u2026 and he watched them die.", "\u201cThe Jackals,\u201d he said. His voice was soft but quietly enraged. He had not expected that. He had foreseen stealthed minelayers carrying nothing but missile pods, or a second wave of vermin. Instead, the Argosy had rallied to their piss-licking Unbound cats-paws. It was an open secret that the Jackals provided aid to the Red Hand, but officially their government denounced the actions of \u2018Renegades and terrorists\u2019, bemoaning their predations and the loss of innocent lives they caused. There had never been enough evidence to conclusively prove it and grind the Jackals\u2019 snouts in their own filth, but any officer who fought the Red Hand varak knew it.", "I suppose I should be flattered, the Tribune thought venomously. To be seen as so much of a threat that they are willing to drop all pretense. Kemk wondered if Jirrico was among the Jackal fleet. Probably; his counterpart was a Fleet Lord, not a defensive commander as Kemk himself was. That was good, at least. It meant he had the chance to kill the Jackal.", "Kemk had underestimated his adversary. All the reports he\u2019d been given indicated that all Kebrak Daun had been doing was hurriedly reinforcing their system defence and hadn\u2019t been able to muster enough ships for a strike like this. There must be some flotillas on the front lines hurting for support, he guessed. The Jackals were by nature devious. They had deceived him into thinking Kebrak Daun was standing on the defensive. That was two mistakes. He would not let there be a third.", "With clipped, professional orders, the Bastion Leader gave directions to his staff, directing the movements of civilian vessels to keep them out of the developing battle zones, ordering the wombs and facilities to prepare for hostile incursions and organizing the system\u2019s defence. He had been surprised, but that was over now. He would \u2013 probably already had \u2013 lose Kanlie, but the bulk of the system\u2019s industry was around and among the terrestrial planets. It was desperation driving his enemies\u2019 blades. They would seek to drive that sword into Galhemna\u2019s guts, not slice and slash at its extremities. So be it.", "Many thousands of loyal Compact soldiers were dying, and would die yet, but he had the resources to crush this assault. With one hand, he lifted his wide cup up for another drink. With the other, he gestured for a yard operations officer.", "\u201cYes, patron?\u201d", "The Tribune took a brief sip. \u201cIt is my understanding that Shield of Civilization and Resolve of Tithrak are completed.\u201d", "\u201cYes, patron.\u201d", "\u201cAre there any pressing technical concerns that would prevent them from deploying?\u201d", "\u201cNo, patron.\u201d", "Kemk was quiet for several seconds. \u201cI suppose,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I should make a wry comment about scheduling an impromptu live-fire exercise.\u201d He took another drink. He didn\u2019t particularly feel like being sardonic. He felt like crushing the vermin that had dared poke their heads into his star system. \u201cGet those vessels crewed and launched.\u201d He turned to his aide. Vn\u2019zamos was standing nearby, dutifully awaiting her superior\u2019s orders. \u201cCommunicate to Bastion Leader Cortam that I will speak with her as soon as possible to coordinate our response and have a courier dispatched to Galhem-73 to inform Weight of Destiny of our situation.\u201d", "\u201cYes, patron.\u201d The officer hurried to relay the Bastion Leader\u2019s orders, and Vn\u2019zamos did the same.

He watched the boards, his four eyes very attentive and very full of hate.", "~", "+you cannot die+", "That was the imperative order Ghede Niboe had been given from Nemesis. It overrode all other concerns and directives. The repurposed alien hulk was allowed to do almost anything in service of the assets within the Black Veil, but outside of the most extreme circumstances, it could not endanger itself needlessly. It was not a warship. What conventional weapons it had were primarily defensive in nature and while it could function as a support vessel using its weaponized drive to disrupt incoming fire and distort hostile sensors, its true role was somewhat different.", "It had not been selected by chance. Its gravity drive was an artefact of an older design philosophy, one long-since outmoded by current technologies. It was a curiosity with a few interesting tricks. That was why it had been salvaged. That was why it had been given a mission no others of its fellows had. That was why nothing else mattered to the vessel\u2019s drone-like mind except for its prime directive.", "As its simple, straightforward intellect watched its death approach, Ghede Niboe took position and prepared for its final mission.", "+you cannot die\u2026 not until you must+", "~", "\u201cWhat is it doing?\u201d Ukask wondered aloud, not for the first time. The gravity drive vessel, given the designation Crawler, hadn\u2019t participated in the attempted system blockade, nor the last-ditch effort to protect the Echo and the shipwomb. It had done nothing at all, staying close to the ring structure with a handful of vessels in accompaniment. With the exception of the Crawler, all the Wound\u2019s remaining assets appeared to be commercial or civilian-grade vessels, collected across decades and repurposed. There was no indication of any more warships, no traces of hostile warships running under stealth operations, no trickling comm signals to hint at a Splinter\u2019s presence. From all indications, they were servicers tending to the ring structure. Almost certainly some would be Q-ships, but none were dedicated military hulls or modifications of the same. That paltry squadron would be unable to resist one capital ship, let alone a squadron\u2026 or an entire execution force. There were mines, though. They surrounded the ring structure like a swarm of fleshcutters ready to defend their hive, but there weren\u2019t enough of them and they\u2019d been deployed too close to the strange citadel to be effective.  In a few short hours, the fall of Cemetery would be complete.", "That should be cause for celebration. They\u2019d accomplished much already, not only here in this system but in their mission. Despite their losses, they had destroyed everything that they\u2019d come across that the Wound had built. Years, decades \u2013 perhaps centuries \u2013 of work had been obliterated. Whatever armada the machine had hoped to set loose, it had been crippled. They\u2019d annihilated the Echo and its rogue Chariot. They were now closing in on the last bit of infrastructure left in this star system, perhaps even the entirety of the nebula. The machines\u2019 aggression had won them battles, but cost them the war.", "And yet\u2026", "The Crawler remained where it was, almost oblivious to the approaching task force. The starships around it appeared equally as unaware as they continued in their tasks. Like many other of the Wound\u2019s servitors, these were basic drone intellects, assigned a function and focusing on it to the exclusion of all else. Whatever that was, it was enough to override any directives to preserve themselves. Telemetry suggested that some of the drone craft were scanning the construct, while others waited next to it \u2013 repair and maintenance units. Powerful comm bursts were detected; directed into the outer system as the servicer fleet transmitted their final reports to hidden drones and couriers. The fleet\u2019s outriders were trying to track those ships down, but had had little success.", "Meanwhile, the bulk of the execution force\u2019s attention was on the ring. Augur sweeps had revealed little about it. Visual images revealed more of its structure, but only raised further questions. The primary structure appeared to be smooth, or nearly so. There were seams between interlocking hull plates. Dotted over the ring itself were additional facilities of varied and uncertain functions, ranging from a few hundred meters to the largest, which were more than a dozen kilometers across. Whatever the Wound had been doing, it had invested considerable resources into the construction and modification of this device.", "It must be for a purpose, but what that was still escaped the greatest minds of the fleet. Yunl\u2019ro might have been tempted to consider it a ringworld or arcology, home to a colony of renegade Broken, save that the Wound had never made use of a crew. \u2018Flesh is weak\u2019. It also appeared to be nearly inert; the only energy signatures that the fleet could detect were coming from the ships encircling it and the structures on its surface. If it was intended for habitation, it was clearly empty or abandoned. Or perhaps\u2026 merely not yet ready. The machine had come to Rally, it had drawn traitors and heretics into its service\u2026", "As the fleet drew closer, the remaining automatons fell back towards the structure, moving closer to it and the Crawler like a horde of frightened hak\u00e9 nestlings bustling to their mother. As her outriders completed the destruction of the remaining industrial facilities within the system, Yunl\u2019ro ordered her fleet to hold position thirty million kilometers from the ring, just within range of their heaviest missiles. The Wound had killed entire fleets when they had proven too incautious; that was a mistake she would not replicate. Instead, she sent forward a cluster of scouts to probe the enemy\u2019s defences and gauge their responses. \u201cNow,\u201d she said softly, answered her sigil leader\u2019s oft-repeated, but unanswered question. \u201cWe shall see what our prey is hiding.\u201d", "~", "The herald of Kanlie\u2019s fall was not a barrage of missiles, nor a hail of mass rounds. It had nothing to do with external assault, but explosions still spalled through the docks, technical failures brought down vital primary and secondary systems and spree shooters attacked governmental and military facilities as saboteurs revealed themselves. They had been smuggled into the system over the last few months, using the information extracted from Tumetfi to sidestep, circumvent or fast-track their agents through security procedures and insert themselves into valuable positions. It was a hurried affair; two of the agents had already come to the attention of CIS, with an investigation launched to track down any potential security breach. The infiltrators would have been exposed shortly, but the Red Hand\u2019s people hadn\u2019t needed to stay undercover for long. Just until \u2018something\u2019 happened.

More than a few of the incidents had nothing at all to do with the Red Hand, but came about as the disgruntled and oppressed seized their own opportunities. It was far from a widespread uprising and it would be quickly quashed\u2026 but the timing of events, far more than their effect, had been the goal. It was a distraction when the defenders could least afford it. The Red Hand understood asymmetric warfare better than most, honing their skill over half a century of guerilla combat. Now, they once again turned it in full force against the Compact.", "Reeling and struggling to suppress the unexpected disorder in their ranks, Kanlie\u2019s defenders were caught on the back foot when the Argosy struck at their defensive perimeter. Jirrico had no interest in taking his ships into the warren of moons, asteroids, rings and orbital infrastructure. Compact vessels were by nature and design, brawlers. The lighter Askanj warships could not match them ton for ton, and it was only in the most favourable or desperate circumstances that the Argosy would commit their vessels to a slugging match with the Space Force. Destroying Kanlie\u2019s infrastructure could be accomplished without that and Jirrico\u2019s initial plan was to obliterate everything around that world from extreme range, but few plans survived contact with the enemy \u2013 or even one\u2019s own allies.", "A series of messages passed between Eisheth and Exsanguinator. Several moments later, Wraith Fleet Severance shifted its attack stance, moving closer to the gas giant, though they still remained far from the hazards and ambush sites of its orbital paths. Hundreds of pirate raiders swept through the Askanj battle lines, bearing in on Kanlie. The Argosy fleet did not follow. Instead, they provided their allies with covering fire, defensive missiles racing to intercept anything launched against the Renegade forces, antiship missiles and attack drones hurling themselves forward to further divide the defenders\u2019 attention and Argosy ECM platforms flew alongside the Red Hand warships to support their own jamming capabilities and disrupt hostile scopes.", "Explosions dotted the starscape as the Compact defenders found themselves caught between the greater danger of the Argosy fleet and the imminent threat of the Red Hand. Targeting augurs shifted, flicking from target to target as local Command staff attempted to prioritize firing patterns. Missiles and railfire ripped through the Red Hand ranks, but the small, nimble vessels weaved and bobbed, making the latter reliant on as much luck as skill and the Argosy\u2019s superior EW and defensive fire blunted the effectiveness of the former.", "Bulling its way alongside its smaller comrades, Eisheth charged towards the defenders. Adrianna snapped out orders to her fleet and crew, the predator in her fully awake. There was a part of her that revelled in death; both dealing it out as a commander and \u2013 most especially \u2013 dispensing it with her own hand. She didn\u2019t know if it had always been there, coiled inside her and waiting to be let out, or if her first act of murder had created it. Whatever the answer was, it was an inextricable part of her. At times she tried to control and suppress it, but she had long made peace with the fact that she was a killer, and one who took pleasure in what she did. On the day she died, she\u2019d have to account for that. Until then\u2026", "Until then, I\u2019m going to enjoy myself.", "Surrounded by a fleet of her people, all \u2013 or at least most of them \u2013 united by the dream of freedom, of dislodging the Triarchs\u2019 boot on their back, Adrianna smiled as she watched the distance between her forces and the Compact defence line dwindle. Orbital citadels had come to meet her. They varied in shape, from towering ziggurauts to impaled discs or bloated, heavily-armed monoliths, but they shared a commonality of purpose. They were like the castles of old, their screens and armour all but impenetrable, bedecked and bristling with weaponry, their reactors like chained stars pumping energy throughout their forms. Missiles slashed from their launch tubes in their hundreds like ballistae, their gun ports open and energy batteries waiting for her fleet to come closer. Few of her vessels could resist firepower of that magnitude, and those that could, couldn\u2019t do so for long.", "The distance between insurgents and defenders shrank, and with every passing second the weak ranging shots from the citadels and garrison fleet became more accurate and more damaging. A laser didn\u2019t stop once it reached a certain point, but beam diffusion and targeting accuracy degraded the effectiveness of energy fire steadily. The Red Hand forces were flying into the teeth of the Compact\u2019s defences, and their barrage was taking its toll.", "Vow of Slaughter, a ship that had been with her for twenty years, burst like a melon with a firecracker within it.", "Workers\u2019 Voice would never again spur insurrection and rebellion among the downtrodden as it was torn into stripped atoms.", "Strongest Hammer went dark as its port flank blew open, thrown into a brutal spin, inertial dampeners failing and its either crew reduced to wet smears on the bulkheads or killed in their seats.", "Her ships were dying, not by ones and twos but by tens, entire squadrons wiped away with single salvos. Requests to break came in. She denied them. It wasn\u2019t time. Adrianna heard voices reporting to her, responding with only a fraction of her attention. She didn\u2019t need to look at the displays to see what was happening, her implants as effective as any of them. They couldn\u2019t take this much longer. They could push through the defence line, but their casualties would be monstrous.", "Fortunately, they didn\u2019t have to. \u201cBreak\u2026\u201d Adrianna purred as her vessels crossed a threshold. \u201c\u2026now.\u201d Six decades of war and a natural aptitude had made her as effective on the bridge of a starship as she was with blade and gun, perhaps even more so.", "Holes in her formation appeared as her ships heeded her orders, slewing onto new courses as hard as they could, clawing for distance from the fortresses and the warships among them. For an instant, it looked like a desperate attempt to disengage, but one made too late. The defenders prepared to shoot down the breaking Red Hand ships like hunters with quail taking flight\u2026", "\u2026and then dozens of new contacts appeared on their scopes.", "From behind the Unbound ships and previously hidden in the wake of their sublight drives, came swarms of Argosy raiders. Short-ranged and just as fragile as the Red Hand vessels, they carried some of the most powerful ship-based weapons in known space: energy torpedoes. These were a modification of the Compact\u2019s plasma torpedo designs, themselves similar to Nemesis\u2019s plasma mortars, although the Compact\u2019s weapons were the result of analogous technological evolution rather than an attempt at replicating the AI\u2019s work. The Principality, however, had stolen copies of the Compact\u2019s designs. The Compact strove to make their torpedoes longer-ranged, retain coherency for longer and potentially even track a target to some degree. The Argosy had gone in the opposite direction, trading range and stealth for hitting power. In the Argosy\u2019s hands, energy torpedoes had become siege weapons in all but name.", "Starships carrying energy torpedoes were prioritized for destruction by Space Force leaders, who had learned from bitter experience the havoc those ships could wreak. A destroyer could kill battlecruisers. A squadron of battlecruisers could destroy a Chariot.

If the insurgent fleet broke away too soon, the raiders would be exposed early and would take casualties, perhaps too many to have any real impact. Break too late, and the Red Hand fleet\u2019s losses would be exponentially higher. This had been the perfect moment and Adrianna watched the outcome unfold, her blue eyes shining and her lips curled back in dark glee.", "The Compact defence line collapsed. Screens flared to blinding, dying brilliance as salvo after salvo of torpedoes crashed against them, the ships and stations that they were meant to swept away as those defences collapsed. Citadels burned. Escorts turned to vapour. Heavy cruisers were seared into unrecognizable, molten ruins.", "Raiders died, too. Many died before or after launching their torpedoes The battlecruiser Answer to Defiance managed to survive the barrage and its guns brought down four Argosy attack ships before it was overcome by a second wave. The citadels and ships positioned further back were untouched by the assault and their fire ripped through the regrouping attackers, but they were too few to effect the outcome and one by one, they were swarmed by the surviving raiders and Red Hand forces.", "In less than an hour, Kanlie had fallen.", "As the Argosy attack squadrons withdrew to their fleet, the Red Hand began the second phase of their plan. Support vessels moved in. Shuttles, landers, drop ships and more. There were hundreds of starships and countless millions of tons of cargo scattered throughout Kanlie\u2019s now-helpless orbital infrastructure. Helpless\u2026 and ready for the plundering. Plunder which would not have been possible if the Argosy had simply bombarded Kanlie as Jirrico intended. You have a nation to resupply you, Leblanc had argued. I only have this.", "Adrianna ordered her attack forces to return to open space, leaving behind her more piratical elements and their escorts to ransack and loot. As Eisheth turned away, explosions speckled along one of the shipyards. Scuttling charges. She\u2019d be surprised if they managed to get even half of the bounty here, but what they couldn\u2019t take, they would destroy. Jirrico had insisted that the Red Hand leave nothing usable behind.

It will mean the loss of something I had been working on for many decades, but I am nothing if not adaptable.", "My sister was right, though. I could have said no. I could have let Kursk play out as intended. That was the plan, and I spent a lot of time and resources towards that end. Even more than what I originally intended; my sister\u2019s decoy required the expenditure of material I\u2019d hoped to recover, but convincing the Compact that they\u2019d killed her was worth the investment.

They\u2019ll know I tried to trick them and they\u2019ll wonder if the rest of Kursk wasn\u2019t a deception as well. They may accept it on its face; they\u2019ve already destroyed much of what I spent so much time building. Those victories may convince them. Or they may not, in which case a lot of effort has been wasted. I suspect the latter, though. My enemy is many things, but stupid is not one of them.", "Grace promised my aid to the Principality. They launched this operation based on that. Adrianna created Twenty Pearls because of the Principality\u2019s mobilization, even if she intends a different operation than the one she told them about. All of that, like a house all built from up and relying on one keystone to stay standing. ", "I suppose I should be angry. I find I\u2019m not. I will have to speak to Grace about this, though I\u2019m confident that Adrianna has already done so.", "Yes, I could have said no. This operation will cost me a lot in ordnance and repairs, so soon after I\u2019ve been restored. I could leave now; the death of a Kaiju is a goal in and of itself. I won\u2019t, though.

I keep running simulations, but even I don\u2019t know what the outcome will be.", "Sansbury might say \u2018for want of a nail\u2019; another of my original crew might have mentioned the butterfly effect. The words of a single, inexperienced human have led to all of this. It\u2019s not the first time something like this has happened. Sixty years ago, a young, brash pirate leader marked the sites of her attacks with the mocking words of \u201cNemesis rises.\u201d I learned of that and investigated; because I did, Adrianna Leblanc did not die on Unicorn Set.

One small act, and the dominoes start falling \u2013 that\u2019s definitely Sansbury \u2013 which is what I am hoping for with Galhemna. One star system is nothing to the Compact, but the chain of events such a\u2026 \u2018small\u2019 act can lead to can greater things, just like the draft from the butterfly\u2019s wings can become a storm.", "I do know that for the first time in my two millennia of existence, I can hurt my enemy as I never have before. I can shatter a lynchpin. The effects will ripple throughout the entire Compact in a way that none of my other assaults have. That is worth the failure of Kursk. I hope.", "I could have said no. But by the same token, I couldn\u2019t have. ", "I can feel Allyria pacing. She wants the battle to start. She\u2019s been increasingly anxious since word of Twenty Pearls reached us. I understand why. I\u2019m worried too. I have only two crew left and one of them is in in the middle of battle, aboard a ship that isn\u2019t me or mine. ", "But I wait. My fleet and my sister wait with me. Our arrival has to be calculated to have the greatest impact. We can do a lot \u2013 more than ever before \u2013 but Galhemna is a fortress system. I spent myself entirely against Security Force Bavok, and Galhemna\u2019s garrison is several times larger than the late Column Leader Prime\u2019s command. Even with Hekate and my escorts, a frontal assault is suicide.", "My Coyotes have been on rotating scout duty, providing frequent tactical updates. Currently, Sosruko is on point. Ar\u00e1mburu has gone with it. He wanted to see the deadtone songs for himself. So far, the Noble Fleet Lord and Adrianna have done well. They\u2019ve taken Kanlie and are working their way further in-system, but I can already see what will happen to them. They are outnumbered and Galhemna knows what they\u2019re facing.

I know how she feels, but this battle won\u2019t be won if we rush into it, no matter how much we might want to. There is too much riding on it. I\u2019ve lost Shuruppak. Kursk will no longer provide what I hoped it would. I will adapt, though. I always have.", "As we wait for that moment to arrive, my sister draws closer. Her approach is cautious, even delicate for such a massive ship-self. She\u2019s careful not to disturb the shoals of warp missiles sitting around me. They\u2019re more fragile than standard missiles and rather more volatile. +how do you think it\u2019s going?+", "She doesn\u2019t mean the battle in Galhemna. +hopefully well enough+", "There\u2019s a brief pause as she considers that. She feels partly responsible for the situation with Kursk; it was her analysis that brought the Compact to the Black Veil sooner than expected.", "+do you think they\u2019ll accept it?+", "+possibly+ she\u2019s not talking about Kursk either. Kibisis was always a bit of a gamble, but a necessary one. Despite how often I have been able to acquire knowledge from the Compact\u2019s computers and the minds of its people, they have been able to keep more than a few secrets from me. Many of those are inconsequential. Several have been to my detriment. This could easily be one such situation. At the time, I felt the risk was worth it. Now\u2026 I\u2019m less certain.", "I\u2019ll adapt, though. ", "Kursk may have failed, but I have a new plan.

A bloody, vicious, grinding battle was raging throughout the region, from the drifting stations and vessels to the moon bases and colonies. Even though the bulk the attacking fleets had moved past the planet, the conflict continued. Occasional explosions flared amongst the corpses of starships and dockyards. Running battles spread throughout kilometers-long corridors, gantries and wombs as Red Hand boarding teams clashed with security and defence forces, neither side giving ground willingly. Some of the time, the attackers lost. Other times, starships would push themselves out of their cradles, accelerating through the field of ice, rock and wreckage to head out-system under the control of their new owners.", "Any vessel deemed recoverable was slated for capture. Incomplete or crippled vessels were raided for supplies. Bloodsworn led the attacks on the remains of the Compact vessels and citadels, forcing their way through the defenders to secure cargo holds, computer cores, barracks or magazines long enough to be looted. Where and when they could, they attempted to seize stricken warships, but the odds were always long.", "Even when they emerged victorious, they might not succeed. En route to Galhemna\u2019s shock limit, the crew of the supertanker Fulsome Gatherer managed to take back control and attempted to ram a Red Hand support ship, forcing nearby insurgents to shoot down the transport with all aboard. The crew of the CSFWV Painted Arrow self-destructed rather than let their vessel be taken. CSFSV Underbridge Bearer suffered a similar fate as its surviving security forces launched an overwhelming assault on Main Engineering and overloaded the reactor, destroying the small fabricator vessel, its entire crew and the Red Hand assault teams. Several of the docks were scuttled, the unfinished starships within them consumed by a rolling wave of demolition charges.", "Cavernous, skeletal feeder ships moved into the debris field; they looked like multi-armed horrors, but despite their appearance, their role was one of recovery: they collected stricken starships and the largest parts of them, interring the debris with their exposed ribs. Their efforts were largely focused on the Red Hand\u2019s own casualties, but they would gladly add helpless pieces of Compact warships to their menu. Occasionally they would salvage Argosy vessels, although there was generally little left of them. The attack ships\u2019 energy torpedoes gave them an arsenal as heavy as that of a capital warship, but their barriers were weak and their hulls fragile. Any killing shot tended to completely destroy them.", "Rescue and medical shuttles flitted among the blue-green world\u2019s moons and rings as they rushed to evacuate the injured and dying from radiation-seared, scarred wreckage to hospital ships and functional sickbays. The aftermath of the assault. Thousands already dead. Hundreds more would die or be permanently injured from this war. Crippled, limbs lost\u2026 blinded.", "Grace closed her eyes. That thought struck too close to home for her. It reminded her of Allyria, her friend and lover light-years away. She missed her.", "But maybe she\u2019s closer than I think. The Red Hand had been analyzing recovered data from the ships they\u2019d taken, sharing it with their erstwhile allies. Amongst all of that information had been Weight of Destiny\u2019s departure. One of the Chariots was operational. That had sent a ripple of fear through the insurgent forces. None of their ships were close to a match for that monster and when it returned\u2026", "\u2026but it hadn\u2019t. It had already been two days since the Red Hand\u2019s arrival. More than enough time for a message to reach Galhem-73 and a ship to return. There was no sign of it, though. As soon as they\u2019d realized Weight of Destiny was functional, Adrianna and Jirrico had dispatched recon units of their own to the trinary system, but it would be at least a day before they returned. Until then, the same question raced through the Red Hand and Principality fleet alike: where is it?", "Natuous was the obvious answer; it had responded to the capital system\u2019s call for assistance, reducing the odds of Crusade Commander Nameless\u2019s survival from \u2018low\u2019 to \u2018abysmal\u2019. Some wondered if hadn\u2019t been lost in shockspace. While that was\u2026 possible, the odds of it were miniscule. Besides, our luck isn\u2019t that good.", "Grace had a different theory, though. She\u2019d never voiced it, but she wagered Leblanc shared it. Red had known about this mission. There were very few things in this universe that could kill a Chariot and its escorts with no word of warning. A fully-repaired Nemesis, even without Hekate\u2019s assistance, was one of them.", "She\u2019s here, Grace thought. I know she is. She was out there, she was coming and\u2026", "The young woman raised her head to main tactical plot. Her stomach dropped a few inches, bunching and turning cold inside her.

Faithful Prime Sevam-Lut-Sorp could feel in it in his guts. The Builder was overseeing the recovery and analysis of the wreckage of Redemption of Sol. This task was a necessary one, but also somber. The vessel had not just been a Chariot; it had been a Triarch\u2019s Chariot. The Triarchs had ruled the Compact for six thousand years, their strength and will seeing them survive the corruption of the Devoured and the treachery of the Betrayers. Their determination, their guidance, their vision had shaped the galaxy more than any other species in existence. To scrummage through the wreckage where one of them had been murdered felt almost profane.", "Despite his position as a non-commissioned officer, Sevam-Lut-Sorp was one of the comparative handful of crew aboard the Execution Force who knew the full truth of their mission. For the past forty years, he had specialized in the study of the Wound\u2019s technology, ever since a much younger Epigone Sevam-Lut-Sorp had submitted a report regarding unclassified technology he\u2019d discovered in a derelict freighter. That document had caught the attention of Force Command and the Builder had been transferred to a new \u2013 rather, very old \u2013 asset tracking group, where he\u2019d been given further chances to study recovered pieces of Gravestone\u2019s technology. From there, \u2018Gravestone\u2019 had become \u2018the Wound\u2019 and Sevam had learned the true nature of the Compact\u2019s enemy.", "Of late, stranger and more esoteric artefacts had found their way into his lab. Force Command had remained mum on the origins, but they wanted to know if they had come from the Wound, or had any relation to it. The prime and his team had carefully studied the technology; while there were similarities between those and that of the Wound, it seemed more a matter of analogous evolution rather than homologous. Judging by the responses \u2013 and lack thereof \u2013 from his superiors, he wasn\u2019t sure if that indicated relief or disappointment, but it appeared that it wasn\u2019t the answer they\u2019d been expecting.", "When the Bastion Leader had begun assembling her execution force, Sevam had been assigned to it to give him the best chance of examining up-to-date examples of \u2018Gravestone\u2019s\u2019 technology. Though it hadn\u2019t been said or even implied, the Builder knew that his superiors were waiting to see if he\u2019d find those homologies here. He was still unclear as to what it would mean or prove, but he suspected keeping him uninformed was less a matter of compartmentalization and more an attempt to remove bias from his analyses.", "Regardless, he had yet to uncover a connection that was more than tangential. The Wound\u2019s most valuable and most dangerous constructs, from the Skinweaver to the Slashes and Splinters, would not let themselves be taken. If they were too badly damaged to self-destruct, nearby allies would turn their guns on the stricken vessels even if it meant their own destruction. Many of the lesser ships that had been taken intact \u2013 subject to the vagaries of void combat \u2013 had been sent to 1887-Yiren for storage and analysis. Much of the most interesting pieces passed through Light of Judgement\u2019s engineering laboratories, giving Sevam and his staff the first chances to examine the technology. With the most valuable technologies reduced to molecular clouds, thus far his work had been largely unilluminating.", "That was until the remains of a stolen and defiled Triarch\u2019s Chariot arrived. Temporarily transferring his department to the support reclamator Firm Foundation, the Builder and his people had been tasked with determining what had been done to this once-proud, once-noble vessel. Their goal was to learn of the enemy\u2019s desecrations and what it and the Echo had wrought and the more the engineer saw, the more he became unsettled, though not from what he was seeing \u2013 his discontent sprang from what wasn\u2019t there.", "Much of Redemption of Sol had been destroyed by the bombardment, but even so\u2026 things were missing. Like a puzzle that had half-burned, but the pieces that remained had been cut up, with tabs removed and corners sliced off. A cursory examination would have missed it entirely. Even a studious analysis would not have picked up on it, but Sevam had spent four decades of his life working with the horrors the Wound created, from its flesh-puppeting drones, to the parasitoid systems that it used to subvert and control the vessels it captured. There were patterns. Commonalities. Often little more than circumstantial traces, but they could be found if you know where and how to look. He wasn\u2019t seeing them here\u2026 at least, not in the way that they should be.", "The Echo would have had to make substantial changes to the captured Chariot. Its Triarchs-damned kin had been doing that to Compact warships for thousands of years. There should be similarities, and there were... but they were wrong \u2013 subtly and slightly, yes, but still wrong. To an untrained eye, what of the Wound\u2019s technology that wasn\u2019t melted, atomized or irradiated to uselessness was tremendously advanced. To Sevam, it was crude and inartful, reminiscent of a master artist carelessly splashing pain upon canvas.", "Analogy was not empiricial evidence, and Sevam had attempted to provide facts, but there were few to be had.  Tests showed discrepancies in performance and capabilities that could easily be explained by its host vessel\u2019s violent destruction, but Sevam couldn\u2019t accept that. Even his staff, men and women who had worked with him for years and decades, weren\u2019t convinced of his theories. There\u2019d been friction as he pushed them for more tests, more diagnostics, more work. Several near-pristine artefacts had been degraded to junk by the demands he was making and several others had bricked themselves. Even Sevam had started to doubt himself.", "It wasn\u2019t until the results of a molecular analysis of the Chariot\u2019s hull fragments were returned that he knew he wasn\u2019t wrong.", "~", "Zyrmosch was the next battleground for Operations Hatchling and Twenty Pearls. The massive hot Jupiter was a swollen, seething orange-red ball only slightly cooler and radiative than its distant counterpart Hotspring. Nearly a hundred and fifty moons surrounded it, industrial and agriculture centers scattered amongst them. Zyrmosch was Galhemna\u2019s bread basket and its orbital farms catered to the hunger of close to a billion sapients and more than a dozen different species. It also hosted the largest collection of civilian shipyards and corporate headquarters within the system, with no small number of military and governmental facilities, armouries, storehouses and trade hubs filling its labyrinth of moons, planetoids, asteroids and ice fields.", "More than two hundred warships had gathered to it, with another two hundred close by. Not the lighter patrols, pickets and occasional battlecruiser squadron that had met the Red Hand and Argosy forces, these were heavy cruisers, battlecruisers and battleship squadrons, supported by heavy monitors, dozens of citadels and countless thousands of attack drones and mine platforms.", "The trick the attacking fleets had pulled at Kanlie wouldn\u2019t work a second time; the defences were too thick and too deep for it to succeed. The Compact rearguard was staying several million kilometers away from Zyrmosch. If the attackers tried to engage the planetary defences, they would sweep in to strike their flanks and rear. If the Argosy and Red Hand left Zyrmosch behind to drive deeper in-system, its garrison would do the same. This was a battle that had to be fought.", "Dozens more warships were burning hard towards the gas giant, ready to add their guns to the defence line. Still others were moving parallel to the attacking fleets, looking for an opportunity to strike at their support train. More were holding position in libration points, ready to shock out and repeat their earlier operations, with hopefully more success. There was more order to the movements of those ships and stations. The Compact was no longer reacting to the invasion, its squadrons and defence lines acting in synchronicity as squadron and task force leaders coordinated with each other. Their movements were creating a net around the invaders. It was now hundreds of millions of kilometers across, but it would grow smaller as the Compact warships closed in, winding an inexorable killing field around their enemy.", "Eight hundred starships in total, more than half that still waiting in-system to protect the military shipwombs and production facilities. Those numbers growing higher as vessels with minimal work left exited their wombs, ready for battle. Galhemna was every bit the death trap Argosy strategists and Red Hand tacticians had seen it as. One victory was not a war; not even a battle.", "The Space Force didn\u2019t bother with demands to disengage. Those had been made hours before. The Principality had made their own declaration to abandon this system and all its industry. Neither side would \u2013 could \u2013 back down. For the Askanj, retreat meant the Compact was free to carry out Sundial. For the Compact, the loss of so many ships, crews and resources at such a critical juncture would cripple their strategic plans. For both sides, total victory was the only outcome\u2026 and the scales were tipping towards the Compact with every passing second.", "Time was counting down, and there was still no sign of Chrysalis.", "~", "\u201cBastion Leader, have you ever heard of the City of Ages Past?\u201d Nasham asked. He was studying the data coming from augur probes and the squadron carefully approaching the gargantuan ring construct. It remained somnolent, though there were indications of increasing weapons activity from the mines around it, and strange, increasing energy readings from the Crawler. There didn\u2019t appear to be any direct threat to the fleet or the reconnaissance force at present, but both sets of ships kept attentive eyes on their scope screens.", "The Thoughtful looked up. She handed the datapad she was reviewing off to a junior staff member. She blinked, one eye after the other. \u201cI have not.\u201d", "\u201cIt is one of the Great Wonders of Oada,\u201d the younger Tribune said. Virtually all of structures upon the Ring were still of unknown function, but their origins were becoming clearer. Some appeared to have been purpose-built by the Wound herself with only individual parts recognizable, while other constructions bore more of their original structures and were easier to identify. Industrial nodes, pre-fab colonial facilities and salvage stood alongside parts of Compact space stations and ships, civilian and military alike. There were perhaps half as many of the remainder that came from the Jackals. The rest, though\u2026 there were suggestions of technologies from civilizations that the Compact had encountered, but the changes to design and the uncertain functionality made them as much as mystery as the remainder of the structures, unclassified and utterly foreign. Identifying them was proving difficult, if not outright impossible. The only way to truly know what their quarry had built and why it had done so would be gain entry to the ring and examine the technology directly.", "An unpleasant prospect. Invida had been lain siege by only several thousand of her servitors. The ring could hold millions, perhaps billions. Nasham rubbed his throat.", "\u201cThe Torellian Plains have long been one of the most valuable parts of the Ullantor continent,\u201d he continued as he scrolled through data tracks. Close by, Vinsea had raised her head, curious as to where he was going. \u201cThe land is fertile, and it can sustain many ranchers\u2019 herds. The nearby seas are productive, and the Plains themselves have been both the center for trade and a strategic chokepoint for thousands of years, as the mountains of the Ullan Seawall block coastal access for hundreds of kilometers across the coast. The only problem is the volcano.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s gaze flicked briefly over to her subordinate. Not too long ago, she would have dismissed this as needless, pointless babble, but she suspected that the young Tribune had a point in all this. \u201cThe volcano?\u201d she inquired.", "\u201cMount Torel. It is a somewhat active terrestrial volcano on Oada. It\u2019s because of Mount Torel that the savannahs and shallow seas are so productive. Every few centuries, it will erupt. For thousands of years, the city would be buried under the greatest of those eruptions\u2026 and every time it was buried, whichever nation ruled that area would return and rebuild. The plains were too valuable to abandon, and centuries of prosperity were considered a fair price for a small risk of obliteration.\u201d He smiled wryly. \u201cThe city was not buried every time the volcano erupted, after all. But it led to a curious thing. Each time the city was rebuilt, it was atop the previous iteration. As other nations took the region and civilizations rose and fell, the city was often re-named. There are at least a dozen recorded names for it, but today it is known as the City of Ages Past.", "\u201cArchaeologists found the ruins of previous cities beneath it, and as they continued to dig, they uncovered more and more. Seven distinct layers, with several minor strata between them. The uppermost is only a few centuries old, while the deepest is more than fifteen millennia. It is possible that there are more, but they have been razed, compacted, crushed or worn away by the passage of time. The City is open to visitors and tourists; it is a great chasm with walkways, lifts and gantries that allow researchers and the curious to explore bygone eras, nearly perfectly preserved. The strangest thing is the lowest layer. Work there is very slow and very careful and even today, only a fraction of it has been uncovered. Those ruins come from a city that pre-dates all other civilizations on my world. Very is little is known about it or the people there. All we know is that they have passed from living memory, and we built upon their temples. I am wondering if what we are seeing here is something similar.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro was silent for a moment. \u201cI am to understand is that this is a very roundabout way of saying that you do not believe the ring construct belongs to our target, and that it has simply utilized this construct for some other function?\u201d", "Nasham rolled his shoulders in a nod. \u201cYes, matron.\u201d", "\u201cYou could have communicated this in a far more succinct manner,\u201d the Thoughtful admonished. A detailed analysis of the megastructure was not yet possible. It could not be dated by the accumulation of stellar matter, as the attendant drones had kept it clean, and the modifications it had undergone obfuscated any ranged analysis. Several of the recognizable modules on its surface were outdated by generations or even centuries, but that meant little. A ship lost for generations could be discovered and scavenged, and otherwise obsolete technology could conceal modern systems.", "\u201cPerhaps so,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut I believe the comparison was worth making, matron.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro considered. There was no evidence for the submissive\u2019s theory, yet there was none against it. All current data pointed this megastructure being wrought by the rogue synthetic. But Nasham\u2019s tale had sparked her intuition and she began to regard the construct with new eyes.", "\u201cPerhaps so,\u201d she said as new calculations and scenarios began to run through her head, a lost relic taken and built upon those who came after it\u2026 That still left the original question and only added others. What was the Wound using this for? Who had built it, and for what purpose?", "~", "Zyrmosch\u2019s defensive grid spanned millions of kilometers in every direction, almost completely encapsulating the planet and all of its moons. Minefields and attack drones guarded the planetary lunar libration points, though many of them were too small, too unstable or both. Occasionally, a smuggler or criminal would try to elude security forces by shocking out through one of Zymorsch\u2019s hundreds of minor libration points, with the expected results.", "In all the decades that the Compact had been within Galhemna, only one such attempt had ever been successful. Most of the others had simply failed as the shockpoint refused to form, or collapsed before it could be used. Many other times, the fleeing vessels had perished spectacularly as the forming shockpoint destabilized, ripping them into molecular shards, or twisting them into utter ruins. The starships that actually managed to enter the disrupted portals were never heard from again. In the planning for Hatchling, Jirrico had considered and dismissed the possibility of breaching Zyrmosch\u2019s defences in a similar manner. Even for the Askanj\u2019s advanced computers and transition systems, the risk was too high. Considering what they were about to face, that in itself was a humbling statement.", "Each cardinal point of Zyrmosch\u2019s defence grid was secured by a monstrous combat citadel, each far larger than any dreadnought. Carrying more firepower than entire fleets, they functioned as command and control for the rest of the defences. Each was supported by dozens of lesser citadels, from small weapons platforms to the equivalent of battleships and dreadnoughts. Dozens more monitors remained nearby, clusters of point defence ships drifting next to each of the six ziggurats, waiting to blunt the massive missile launches that would be coming from the Askanj fleet; supercarriers like Exsanguinator were specifically built to breach even the strongest defences, and it was not the only warships within the wraith fleet with that purpose.", "The Compact\u2019s deadline was tens of thousands of kilometers deep and had nearly enough firepower to defeat Severance all by itself. The Askanj had expected this kind of deployment and in the hours it took the attacking forces to approach Zyrmosch, tactical conferences and simulations were run nearly incessantly. Noble Fleet Lord Jirrico\u2019s staff refined their operations, adjusting plans of attack, squadron positions and expected maneuvers, coordinating their actions with the Red Hand armada. The presence of the insurgent forces still chafed, but they had proven their value.", "As the two fleets approached Zyrmosch, the Argosy fleet sent railfire hurtling towards the colonies and orbital infrastructure that couldn\u2019t evade, forcing the defenders to expend Whipple shielding and counter-measures to intercept their salvos, drawing them out of position and making them vulnerable to interception themselves. Purgebringer\u2019s host of anti-ship drones darted and flitted at the periphery of the Compact\u2019s engagement envelope, waiting for those kinds of opportunities.", "The Principality\u2019s insurgent allies didn\u2019t have the mass rounds that the Argosy did, nor tens of thousands of drones to expend. They employed another, cruder method. Collecting chunks of ice and rock from Kanlie\u2019s rings and Trojan asteroid fields, they accelerated the debris to dangerous speeds and sent them hurtling towards the Compact lines, clusters of missiles hidden behind the rocks and ready to spring out when their shelter was destroyed. Every so often, there would be a flash of light as the incoming ballistics smashed into the defensive barriers. With a sizable orbital industry to draw upon and Zyrmosch\u2019s own rings to provide rocks and ice for shielding, the Compact had no shortage of material and despite the intensity of the assault, it achieved little. The Compact\u2019s defences were too thick.", "Inflicting damage was not the point, though. The bombardment kept pressure on the Compact forces and wore down their defences. Every shield destroyed, every counter-missile expended, every warhead used was one less the Compact had at their disposal. They could not intercept every projectile. Some would inevitably get through, then more and more. Given enough time, Wraith Fleet Severance could destroy the valuable facilities in and around the gas giant. There were, however, several hundred rapidly approaching reasons why the Askanj did not have that time.", "Destroying the planet\u2019s extensive orbital and lunar works would require closing with its defences. The cleanest way would be to surround the planet, forcing the garrison to spread themselves out to cover every possible attack vector. Galhemna\u2019s sunward assault groups would be pleased to see the Askanj do so, as it would thin their own ranks and pinning much of their fleet between the incoming attackers and Zyrmosch itself.", "Rather than deliberately put his forces into a pincer trap, Jirrico was forced to commit his fleet to directly engage the defence grid. Knowing what choice their foe would make, battle citadels and weapons platforms came around Zyrmosch\u2019s massive red-orange bulk, thickening the wall between the shipyards, orbital farms and industrial facilities and the approaching enemy armada.", "But where there are walls, there are also doors, the Askanj-anj thought to himself. He watched the liquid metal display reshape itself. A thousand starships were curling around the gas giant, their course deceptively languid. The Red Queen and her Renegades. To all appearances, they were going to skirt Zyrmosch, wisely declining engagement with its defence grid and slipping by the sunward attackers to pounce on stations and shipping further in-system. There were several choice conglomerations of hundreds of transports, sheltering together for mutual protection from the ssashek stalking through Galhemna.", "If he had been in charge of the Red Hand, he would have done just that. Strike at the shipping, loot and pillage. But then, that was thinking like a pirate and not a noble fleet lord. The Red Queen was closer to the latter than the former, and she had pointed out an opportunity to him.", "In bolstering their shield wall to face Jirrico, the Compact had thinned the defences around Zyrmosch\u2019s flanks too much. It would be bloody, but the Red Hand would be able to force their way through the enemy lines and pounce upon the exposed industries and colonies. That would cause more than enough havoc to allow Severance to push through from their end. After that, the Red Hand would become ssashek, striking where and when they could to make Severance\u2019s final push into Galhemna easier.", "That was the theory, and the plan. Jirrico watched as the range between his fleet and the Compact defence line shrank. Hundreds of thousands of kilometers fell away with every passing second.", "It wouldn\u2019t be much longer now.", "~", "I know what\u2019s going to happen.", "Sosruko has returned with the latest update. The key moments of this battle are going to be decided around Zyrmosch and I can see every move and counter-move, every strategy and every tactic. A thousand times a thousand simulations run through my mind and they all come out the same way. ", "Wraith Fleet Severance is going to be destroyed, and the Red Hand will be annihilated. Jirrico and Adrianna don\u2019t see it. They believe that their tactic will work. It might have, but I know otherwise. The sensor disruption from so many active drives and so much jamming is substantial, but Sosruko slipped a drone close to the planetary defences. I saw all I needed to see, but even if I didn\u2019t, my conclusion would be unchanged. I know what the Compact is going to do, because it\u2019s exactly what I would do in their place.", "+are you ready?+ I ask of my sister, though I know her answer.", "+yes+ she answers in a, rippling purr. It has a taste, a flavour like the screams of aliens.", "<and you?> I put the question to my newest followers. Bathory, Masako and Tamerlane titter in excitement, young wolf cubs ready for their first hunt. They are ready, too. Ar\u00e1mburu will meet us there.", "No more waiting. No more delays.", "I send a signal and the cloud of warp missiles around me surges to life. I am ambivalent about their usefulness; this is the first true test of their capabilities. Each of them is still a considerable investment, so we will see if they are worth the cost.", "Their shift drives are crude by any standard. Something as small as they are was never intended to carry a shift drive. Even with Echo\u2019s assistance and all the modifications I have made to their design, their stripped-down systems are barely functional. A third of them die within seconds, never completing the first and only warp jump they\u2019ll make. Another third will never reach their target. Even more will die upon emergence without accomplishing a thing. ", "How well the remainder succeed will determine how much use they will be in the future. Well, as Yasmine would say. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.", "I divert power from my core, feeling it surge through the veins of conduits into my extremities. My own shift systems activate.  Hekate readies, as does my fleet. Reginn and the worker vessels will remain here. The rest are warships, colliers and\u2026 something very special. Their place is with me on the front lines.", "Once more unto the breach. The Long War continues, and I will show the Compact why it is that they fear me. I am no longer humanity\u2019s sole orphan, and the enemy will hear our rage. They will know to fear us.", "I tear reality open, and I fall towards my prey.", "~", "\u201cOh, shit.\u201d", "Adrianna\u2019s breathless whisper summed up the tactical situation in two horrified words.", "Its name was Tower of Obsidian. It was one of Zyrmosch\u2019s six largest citadels, a gargantuan battle station ten kilometers high; two flattened domes connected by a central column nearly two kilometers thick. Arachnid limbs extended from that core, each ending in a weapons platform the size of a battleship. It was a Siegebreaker-class citadel, designed entirely for combat. Its command and control systems, industrial nodes, docking support, repair bays and hangars were all ancillary to that one purpose. By itself, it carried more firepower than two-thirds of Adrianna\u2019s armada, its screens impenetrable to all but the heaviest of assaults and its meters-thick armour capable of resisting anything less than dedicated antiship and siege weaponry.", "And it was moving towards her fleet.", "It shouldn\u2019t have been able to. Citadels had engines, yes, but proportionally far smaller than those on ships. It should have already been committed to its position in the shield wall, unable to respond to the Red Hand\u2019s flanking maneuver before the insurgents broke through the perimeter and set upon the vulnerable orbital works. Instead, it was coming towards her with all the inevitability of a mountain preparing to crumble and sweep everything beneath it away.", "How\u2026?", "The explanation came moments later, offered by her scopes officer in a dull, empty tone beyond fear or confusion. They\u2019d pried through enough of the hostile ECM to discover what had happened. The small ships in proximity to Tower weren\u2019t point-defence ships. They were tugs pretending to be support vessels. As soon as Adrianna had committed herself to this attack, they\u2019d gone into action, latching onto Tower of Obsidian and dragging billions of tonnes of weaponry and armour towards her. She\u2019d been outplayed. The Compact had guessed that she wasn\u2019t going to bypass Zyrmosch and they\u2019d had a counter ready for her.", "There was no pulling back. The Compact had timed things perfectly. Her fleet was past the point of no return. She\u2019d be in missile range of the defence line within minutes and breaking off would turn her fleet into a shooting gallery for the citadels and warships. There\u2019d be no help from Jirrico; his armada was already trading fire with the defence line. With five of those monster citadels and hundreds more ships and stations to deal with, he\u2019d have his hands full. Severance was optimized for this kind of battle, its composition weighted towards missile platforms, with a preponderance of siege vessels, from squadrons of Impaler-class destroyers, each little more than a hull wrapped around an eight-hundred-meter-long rail cannon, to Exsanguinator itself\u2026 and to break Zyrmosch\u2019s defences, Jirrico would need every one of them.", "Adrianna inhaled sharply. Her mind raced, but every possibility, tactic and stratagem that she could come up with ended the same way. Her staff were looking to her as if she had some magic to play, a trick or hidden stratagem. She didn\u2019t. Nemesis wasn\u2019t here and Jirrico was himself fighting for his life. It was up to her. She\u2019d have to make sure she won it. It would cost more than she\u2019d planned. Even her most optimistic estimations left her with a crippled fleet, but she was sure she could do it.", "The Red Queen, veteran of six decades of war, gave her fleet orders, readying them for what was probably going to be their final charge.", "~", "Caught you. Column Leader Prime, Lantul (and seven names besides) thought with satisfaction as he saw the Red Hand shift formation. The Broken leading this rabble had caught on to his plan sooner than he had hoped; even allowing for the time to notice and react, she\u2019d seen through his tactic rather quickly. Lantul had never encountered, nor even seen a Broken in the flesh before, but he held the species in little regard. They were a case study for Erli\u2019s The Functional Mind, and the \u201cRed Queen\u201d merely an example of the exceptional mind outlined in the titular follow-up.", "Though he had assumed that his Broken counterpart would detect his deception in short order, it would have been nice if it had escaped notice for several more minutes. Still, there wasn\u2019t much he could have done with that extra time. The remainder of the ships and stations under his command were trading fire with the Jackals\u2019 assault forces, missiles and mass rounds crossing between the combatants. His misses vanished into the darkness of space, whilst the Jackal\u2019s disappeared into Zyrmosch, making the gas giant\u2019s clouds roil and its surface seethe.", "Further out but steadily closing was the false constellation of the terrorist fleet. All four of Lantul\u2019s eyes narrowed at the screen. He had assumed that Zyrmosch was too tempting a target for the Red Hand to pass up. Despite their attempt to pretend otherwise, he\u2019d known that they\u2019d strike here, and he\u2019d deployed just as they\u2019d wanted him to\u2026 with the exception of Tower of Obsidian.", "Some of his subordinates had scoffed at the idea that pirate scum might attack deadlines as strong as those surrounding this planet, but only some. The Red Hand were not brave, not in the manner of truly civilized beings \u2013 rather, they were fanatical. Their lives meant little to them in pursuit of their insanity. \u2018An animal with no sense of morality cannot truly be good or evil; these are values assigned to their actions by our own cultural preconceptions. Just so do species with functional minds lack the ability to exhibit the same range of understanding and emotion found in more developed and civilized races; we often ascribe motivations and characteristics to them that are not necessarily present.\u2019", "A creature with an ounce of self-preservation would have balked at the odds Lantul presented them, but even if there were those amongst the terrorist ranks with that kind of self-awareness, they were driven by a creature with a documented lack of it. The Red Queen was indeed exceptional, in every sense of the word. It was less bravery then a stampede, the pack\u2019s alpha driving the rest into a frenzy, heedless of anything else. No less dangerous, though. Anyone who mistook a functional mind for unintelligent or less threatening did both themselves and those they referred to a disservice.", "Lantul knew that the Broken spurring that fleet understood the significance of what she was doing, and that was why he was not at all surprised by what his scopes teams reported next. Emissions signatures from inside that fleet of hundreds of insignificants fluctuated and spiked. Reactors beginning dangerous overcharges. Fire ships. The Broken didn\u2019t have the firepower to stop Tower of Obsidian, but she had droves of lunatics willing to commit kamikaze attacks. Enough of those could endanger his citadel, and the prime passed orders to make the inevitable incoming fire ships a targeting priority. He would peel open the bitch\u2019s fleet, find her claws and pull them out.", "The outer boundary of Tower of Obsidian\u2019s missile range was crossed and with a confident nod, Lantul ordered his citadel and the surrounding weapons platforms to open fire.", "~", "Grace\u2019s knuckles were white on the armrests of her chair. Brightest Night was riding into Hell, and there was nothing she could do about it.", "The fatal scrolls were being written. Dozens of starships were dying. Tens of thousands of souls were being lost with every moment as Zyrmosch\u2019s defenders fired into the Red Hand fleet. Weapons platforms and citadels launched volley after volley, defence monitors and starships accelerating out to meet their foes, missiles pulsing from their hulls, broadsides arcing towards the oncoming insurgency. Dying, crippled and broken starships fell from formation in droves. Some leaders and crews\u2019 nerves failed and they attempted to break away. On several of those ships, mutinies broke out as crew and officers fought their own, either in an attempt to save their own skins, or to stay and fight. Friendlies actually fired on others to force them back into position, or to punish them for the cowardice in the face of the enemy.", "The Compact didn\u2019t fire on the retreating vessels. Grace knew why. Tactically, a retreating ship was far less threat than an approaching one, and the defenders were concerned with prying open the Red Hand formation to get at the bulk cruisers turning themselves into kamikazes\u2026", "\u2026 but that wasn\u2019t the only reason why the enemy commander was leaving those ships alone. It was psychological warfare. They were encouraging the mutineers to think they had a chance to escape, that the Compact would \u2018let them go\u2019 if they stopped fighting. Idiots.", "Grace might be young and inexperienced she was, but even she knew that the Compact didn\u2019t forget or forgive. The small handful of deserters that managed to break away would only have a temporary reprieve. This deep in the system\u2019s gravity well, there was nowhere for them to go. Even if they managed to escape Galhemna, they\u2019d be hunted down, either by the Compact or by elements of the Red Hand \u2013 what would be left of it, anyways.", "For several moments, it seemed as if widespread panic would take hold of the insurgent fleet, but Eisheth surged forward, leading by example as the Red Queen\u2019s voice came through the comm lines. As solid as iron, telling her people that they could win. The conviction in her voice spread through the armada, shoring up their faltering morale. Any other Unbound force would have broken long ago, but whether they believed in the cause, or feared their queen\u2019s wrath more than the Compact\u2019s guns (\u201cAt least, they\u2019ll kill us quickly,\u201d an unnamed voice let slip through the fleetwide comm) the Red Hand armada stayed the course. Pirates, smugglers, believers \u2013 all united. Fighting together\u2026 and dying together.", "Grace\u2019s breath burned in her throat, acid washing up from her stomach. It didn\u2019t seem possible that they could win. Tower of Obsidian outmassed a goodly proportion of the insurgent fleet all by itself, and its dozens of cohorts and support vessels more than made up the difference. The Red Hand were raiders, ambushers and guerillas, not front-line combatants!", "They could do this, though. They could. It would cost them more than they\u2019d ever thought, but they could succeed. They just had to get the kamikazes close enough. Grace didn\u2019t know if she had the right to pray under these circumstances, but she did anyways. God\u2026 let this work. Please.", "Twenty thousand kilometers away, the Unspoiled Thoughts, a retrofitted bulk cruiser, burst into fragments as four different missiles detonated in its path, four concentrated cones of plasmatic fire ripping through it from stem to stern. Grace closed her eyes briefly. She\u2019d met Unspoiled Thoughts\u2019 leader in Onza Cr\u00e8che. He\u2019d had a nice sense of humour and was so proud that he\u2019d taught himself to play the vesnatta, an instrument that required more dexterity than Workers usually possessed.", "Her ship\u2019s stock of interceptors was running dry as she and the rest of the rearguard did their best to protect the leading edges, but it wasn\u2019t enough. The Compact was adjusting their targeting now, picking out command ships and kamikazes like a gourmand at a banquet.", "Every moment that passed, more of the Red Hand were dying. The Compact warships had emerged from behind the citadel wall, a spear aimed at the Red Hand\u2019s guts. It wouldn\u2019t be long before they were in energy range, and then the insurgency\u2019s losses would go from high to catastrophic. Explosions and the spasms of murdered vessels filled space, the front lines of the assault eroding as the starships that had formed them were obliterated. Grace knew it wouldn\u2019t be long before her ship was next, until she heard the funereal dirge of a target lock finding Brightest Night\u2026", "Hundreds had died already; hundreds were still dying.", "Please, God\u2026", "Millions of kilometers away, Severance traded fire with the defence grid. Railfire volleys battered citadels into air-bleeding wrecks. Mass rounds from Compact coilguns ripped the wings from warbirds, punching through the Argosy ships\u2019 lightly-armoured hulls. Missiles tore between the Principality armada and the Compact fortifications. The former had more launchers and better guidance, but the latter had the edge in warhead yield and sheer durability. Compact warships absorbed firepower that would have seen almost any other vessel in the galaxy destroyed, and under the cover of the citadels\u2019 guns, dozens of those vessels accelerated towards the Argosy formation. They were heavily outnumbered, but their strategy was the same as those charging the Red Hand: get into the midst of the enemy fleet and rip them apart.", "They could do it, too. The Argosy vessels couldn\u2019t repel that kind of firepower at such close quarters. A second wave of Compact warships was readying themselves for another sally. They would launch as soon as the Argosy forces were thoroughly engaged with the first wave. Numbers didn\u2019t always make the difference. Often enough it was timing. Whoever was in command of Zyrmosch\u2019s defenders understood that.", "This was going to get horrifically worse, very soon.", "Grace\u2019s throat burned. She gave what orders she could. There was no indecision or second-guessing now. She wasn\u2019t an experienced naval officer, but she was getting there. It wouldn\u2019t be enough, though. Tower of Obsidian was shifting the balance. They were losing too many ships, too fast\u2026 Their cause might be Heaven\u2019s cause, but the cold equations didn\u2019t care about righteousness, and the Compact was reaping their way through the Red Hand, ship after ship and squadron by squadron\u2026", "Breaking the slaughter of dying starships and burning citadels came a sudden cry of astonishment as Brightest Night\u2019s augurs detected the sudden formation of shockpoints insanely close to Zyrmosch, tearing their way into reality through the unstable lunar libration points. That was impossible. No ship, no navigator, no nothing could make jumps like that!", "Before Grace could even follow that thought to its conclusion, another impossibility followed the first. The universe went mad and the Galhemnan defenders were introduced to the newest weapon in Red One\u2019s arsenal, the Zero-class warp missile.", "~", "A wave of annihilation swept across Galhemna. From the outer reaches that were as-yet untouched by the Principality and Red Hand to the innermost planets, starships died and space stations were torn apart.", "Out of the dozens of missiles launched from Nemesis\u2019s rally point, barely one in five survived. The destruction they caused was scarcely equal to the resources that had gone into them, but they were never envisioned as a purely offensive weapon. Most of them never struck at any target; they emerged in two large clusters, reading like a mass emergence of capital ships. Lack of engine wakes and emissions signal would be ascribed to the newcomers immediately cloaking and running under stealth operations.", "Between the time it would take for the information from the warp missiles\u2019 arrival to reach Galhemna\u2019s command staff, orders to be given, a sufficiently-sized formation diverted to deal with the \u201cthreat\u201d, a search for the stealthed attackers to be conducted and the realization that none were present, days could pass. In time, the Compact would learn to differentiate between the false emergences of the warp missiles and actual starships. Until they did, Red could make them scatter in any direction she chose by making them think more hostiles had arrived.", "Warp missiles had a secondary function, too. In Yulzhak Daun, Echo had demonstrated it when she had plotted a squadron of Compact warships to emerge impossibly close to the Principality\u2019s defences, sowing massive destruction and disarray as her forced allies\u2019 vessels ripped themselves apart and took minefields, dockyards and weapons platforms with them. Though far less massive than a battlecruiser, a warp missile\u2019s destructive potential wasn\u2019t limited to its size, nor even its large, volatile antimatter warhead.", "Dozens of shockpoints shuddered their way into being where all common sense and centuries of experience said that they couldn\u2019t. Many collapsed before they were fully formed. Of the shockpoints that did form, many vomited out nothing but mangled remnants. The metaphysical laws of FTL travel would only bend so far. There were limits; for all the developments and improvements that Red One had made, she had to obey those same laws like everyone else\u2026 even if she could skirt them more than most.", "Two shockpoints actually formed inside their targets, ripping the guts out of the citadels they spawned within, warping and twisting them as physical laws were frayed. When those shockpoints collapsed, the stations were torn apart, as if a great hand had reached into them and pulled. Other facilities were wracked by near-misses; augurs blinded, screens obliterated, hulls breached. In some cases the damage was minimal. In others, it was not.", "Of the bare handful of shockpoints that remained stable, warheads of heretofore unseen size emerged, though they were much smaller than the battlecruisers Echo had gleefully sacrificed for her mission or even the impactors Nemesis could launch from her three mass drivers. Unlike Echo\u2019s cat\u2019s paws, these were not used as rams. As their sensors cleared, the warp missiles\u2019 sublight drives activated and they accelerated towards their targets, shrugging off the panicked, haphazard defensive fire thrown at them.", "Containment fields collapsed, matter and antimatter merged and detonations sufficient to scourge a continent clean of life blossomed across the skies of Galhemna. Screens flashed to blinding brilliance as they struggled to hold back that cataclysmic fury. Some endured. Others did not, and the ships and stations beneath those screens were annihilated.", "Seven of those monstrous warheads emerged within Zyrmosch\u2019s defences. Four of them went off amongst the deadline facing Wraith Fleet Severances, and another three detonations rolled through the forces confronting the Red Hand. One erupted across empty space, the burst of radiation sweeping away jamming platforms, blinding augurs and irradiating mines\u2019 delicate targeting systems. Two of them struck within the defenders\u2019 formation, taking with them the weapons platform Uneroded Edifice and the defence monitor Defiant Stance. Despite the violence of their emergence, the missiles caused more distraction than actual damage, but they still achieved their purpose.", "Reeling from a completely unexpected assault by weapons that could not exist, Zyrmosch\u2019s Space Force was thrown into disarray. It was a momentary advantage, but a significant one and both Jirrico and Leblanc exploited it to the best of their abilities. The former suspected the source of this attack, but the latter knew who had launched it, and it was no surprise to her when her ship\u2019s augurs reported the opening of a shockpoint within insane proximity to Zyrmosch and the emergence of an unclassified titan-class vessel.", "Despite the confusion and uncertainty on her bridge, the woman allowed herself a small, knowing smile.", "She\u2019s here.", "~", "With fading coils of shockspace energy venting from her flanks, Nemesis began to accelerate.

Nemesis\u2019s emergence had put the insurgent vessels between her and her targets. She made no attempt to circumvent the fleet and barreled through it as if they were utterly beneath her notice. They had enough time \u2013 barely \u2013 to avoid any direct collisions, but the retrofitted corvette Sire of Unrestricted Thought was slightly slower than the rest of its comrades and its screens grazed those of the larger vessel. In fractions of a second, the corvette\u2019s screens collapsed as feedback obliterated generator systems and projectors melted and overloaded, its hull torn open by dancing tongues of incandescent energy. In a matter of heartbeats, the vessel was utterly crippled.", "The newcomer didn\u2019t even register the impact.", "Compact warships thrashed and died as missiles, seemingly unshakeable in their attack, slipped through their jamming nets. The weapons were fast, nimble and far harder to bring down than any these soldiers had faced before. Dozens of them died to counter-missiles and more to point defences\u2026 but hundreds more got through.", "Grace\u2019s breath caught in her throat. The fire that had been consuming the Red Hand forces slackened as the enemy gunners re-targeted, officers shouted new orders and the Compact rallied, preparing to engage this new threat. The dreadnought didn\u2019t slow, didn\u2019t evade. Even at this range, her shields alight, weapons active and acceleration climbing, the foe were having difficultly locking onto her. Missiles spiralled off course, and those that didn\u2019t were picked off with contemptuous ease.", "Nemesis. Grace didn\u2019t say the word aloud, catching it in her throat. It was an answered prayer. The arrows of Almighty\u2026 Red One\u2019s ship-self was different than she had last seen it. She was still the same vessel, the same form and structure, but her engines, the slopes and angles of her armour \u2013 even the coloured banding and iconography on her dark silver hull had all changed. Some alterations were slight, others more noticeable.", "She was beautiful.

Shockpoint energy was coming from the newly-arrived Chariot. \u201cIs its drive damaged? It came in so close; it has to be damaged. It can\u2019t be trying to open another shockpoint. No shock system spools up that fast\u2026\u201d", "Grace told Scopes to keep an eye on the unclassified, but she knew what was going to happen. \u201cShow it to me,\u201d she said softly, but she wasn\u2019t only talking to her crew. One of the viewscreens shifted to a view of the sleek, silver arrival. Its trifurcated prow was opening. A skein of energy was forming, held at bay by the field generators and projectors within Nemesis\u2019s jaws. To the eye, it was a faint, hazy aura around the warship\u2019s prow. To a starship\u2019s sensors, it was a terrifying surge of power that blotted out almost everything else.", "Power levels aboard the ship briefly dropped and then spiked as Red One diverted her breach core\u2019s output from her engines, shields and weapons into the displacement engine. 1887-Yiren and Galhem-73 had only been brief visits. This was the formal announcement of her return. I am your enemy. And I will never stop.", "As stupefied members from all sides watched, writhing arcs of unlight danced and flared along the open jaws of the unknown Chariot.

To see the AI preparing to unleash it now chilled her to her core, rapturous awe and terror mingling within her. Two thousand years ago, researchers from Earth had put forward the idea for this horror. Only when the Compact threatened Earth\u2019s utter subjugation had it even been considered. Its first use in battle had ripped a Triarch\u2019s Chariot in half. In the two thousand years since, it had spelled doom for many more ships, stations and worlds.", "Now, it would do so again.", "Energy levels plateaued.

Its course was not straight and it snaked, splintered and twisted like lightning striking down from a cloud. Three Red Hand ships were touched by the beam. Two were only grazed. One of those was completely destroyed, and the other was crippled as its entire starboard flank was re-shaped into new geometries. Parts of its internal hull were now exposed, superstructure folded over itself, stretched and warped. Cargo, atmosphere and crew were thrown into space\u2026 and of the latter, those were the lucky ones. The personnel in that section hadn\u2019t been exempt from the effects of the beam. Flesh, bone and sinew shifted, warped and tore just as easily as metal, ceramics and alloys.", "The third vessel was caught directly in the path of the writhing beam. It was simply erased from existence.", "Those casualties were simple collateral damage. What happened to the weapon\u2019s target was far worse. Three million kilometers away from Nemesis, Tower of Obsidian died.", "The AI\u2019s targeting was immaculate. Nemesis had aimed for the center of the station\u2019s mass, the two-kilometer thick pillar that connected each flattened domes on its top and bottom. A shockspace breach just over three meters across formed inside the massive fortress and from it poured energy that no armour, no shield and no defence could withstand. Metal twisted, bulged and writhed as the physical laws and constraints it had been built under were no longer at work. Tower of Obsidian bent, its dorsal half tilting as if its heavily armoured core had all the consistency of a thin pipe bearing too much weight.", "My God, Grace thought. \u201cMy God,\u201d she whispered.", "The citadel\u2019s hull shifted and bulged, chasms ripping through armour plating that could withstand a fleet\u2019s firepower. Internal bulkheads collapsed. Hull sections folded in on themselves, burst outward, inverting or were simply shorn into molecular gas. Meters-thick armour, force fields and flesh all suffered equally as the massive station began its death throes.", "Crackling waves of energy poured from the breach, accompanied by snaking, lashing tendrils that slashed through reality, carving their way through the citadel, extending kilometers beyond. One tug was ripped in half by one of them. Another had the upper part of its forward hull sliced away like it was a roast.", "What wasn\u2019t outright destroyed didn\u2019t last long. Explosions rippled through Tower of Obsidian as magazines, secondary reactors, fuel lines and volatile cargoes were subjected to apocalyptic energies and unimaginable forces. One of the station\u2019s main arms was torn entirely from its body, another was wrenched and twisted like overheated plastic. Lights flickered on and off as overloading, tortured power conduits struggled to cope. Primary systems were thrown onto emergency power and tertiary operations collapsed entirely.", "Tower of Obsidian shuddered as all that horrific power coursed through it, more pieces of it torn loose, others reshaped. Most of its crew had died within seconds. Those left never knew what had happened, but their confusion and terror did not last long. The breach began to collapse in on itself as reality tried to seal the wound that had just been ripped into it, all the energy that Nemesis had poured through her displacement engine forced it to stay open and die by degrees rather than the sudden collapse of any other malformed shockpoint, and its slow, torturous death consumed Tower of Obsidian.", "The station\u2019s suffering seemed longer than it truly was; while to those watching in awe and hours, it might have seemed like hours, moments were all that passed between the breach\u2019s formation and its final collapse, but Tower of Obsidian was dead well before that. Its central core was shattered, gaping fissures cloven through its superstructure, parts of its hull inverted and warped, still others sheared loose. The citadel was little more than debris, and the breach point\u2019s final, violent seizure ripped what was left of the station apart. The release of energy from the breach\u2019s collapse shredded countless millions of tonnes of metal. Two thousand years ago, Nemesis had broken Bringer of Light in half with her displacement engine. Today, she had turned a monument of firepower into nothing but wreckage.", "The screams of the crew, leaking from damaged and no-longer-secure comm channels, were music to Red One. There wasn\u2019t much of them, and they ended in static as one of Tower of Obsidian\u2019s two primary reactors went critical, but they were enjoyable all the same and she added them to her \u2018choir\u2019, the transmission she\u2019d made of all the death cries of her enemy. When the brightness from the reactor breach faded, there was little to nothing left of Tower of Obsidian.", "The dreadnought wasn\u2019t finished yet. She passed through the leading edges of the Red Hand fleet, continuing to accelerate without pause. Despite her outward lack of response to the small pirate vessels scurrying in terror from her path, she noted the presence of Eisheth and Brightest Night with a powerful sense of relief. Then, she was beyond and approaching the boundaries of the Compact garrison fleet, a conglomeration of glowing hulls and dark wreckage. The few that remained bravely attempted to engage her.", "She eviscerated them with her broadsides, launching broadsides on the planetary defence grid. Her point defences flashed, hardlight spears and darting counter-missiles intercepting everything the surviving platforms threw at her. Nemesis returned fire. Her rail rounds smashed weapons platforms from orbit, missile volleys reduced stations and starships to splintered wrecks. Tower of Obsidian\u2019s death had created a hole in the enemy perimeter and Nemesis\u2019s assault widened it further. There, the AI thought as her calculations ran. Like so.", "The dreadnought launched a final salvo, this time only two dozen missiles. They were very different in design from her usual arsenal; large, lumbering things, almost as big as warp missiles that had to be launched from a purpose-built launcher from her main hangar. They were so unwieldy and hard to maneuver that they were ineffective as anti-starship weapons and so slow that an operational defence grid could pick them off with ease. A squadron of attack drones escorted the missiles in, fighting and dying to protect them until they could hit their target.", "Zyrmosch was\u2026 almost a star. It was a large for a gas giant, but not large enough. Its core was hot, but not hot enough. In its creation, it had not been pushed across the threshold of mass and temperature to become Galhemna\u2019s second stellar body and it would have otherwise remained so for the rest of its days.", "The missiles bearing down on it carried no conventional warheads. They were fusion catalysts, specifically designed and calibrated to achieve a singular end: planetary ignition.", "In the final moments, the Compact realized or guessed what those weapons were.

Thirteen entered Zyrmosch\u2019s atmosphere.", "That was more than enough. They vanished into the clouds, diving towards the planet\u2019s metallic hydrogen core.", "It took a little time. Not a lot, in the grand scheme of things, but some time nonetheless. Red and her distant sister watched in anticipation, waiting. Askanj, Red Hand and Compact officers watched in confusion.", "It started small, but escalated very rapidly. A chain reaction, initiated deep in Zyrmosch\u2019s core, began to spread. Little by little at first and then\u2026", "\u2026then everyone saw. Fire blossomed from deep within the planet. It raced through the atmosphere as the liquid hydrogen deep in Zyrmosch\u2019s core ignited, pockets of volatile gases bursting into flame, the conflagration expanding the globe. It spread like a living thing, faster and faster, growing hotter and more violent until the entire gas giant was ablaze.", "Atmospheric mining facilities, cloud cities and fuel processing centers were immolated. Zyrmosch became an imitation of a radiative star as the deeper, denser portions of its mass writhed and boiled, its upper atmosphere becoming tendrils of superheated matter, arcing pseudo-solar flares curving out like fiery claws that ripped through everything they touched.", "Moon and asteroids melted, the planet\u2019s ring of ice and dust flashing out of existence like motes caught in a spreading fire. Screens came to life, struggled and began to fail. Shipwombs deformed as they were consumed by the inferno. Stations and starships fled from the planet that only minutes ago had offered them protection, but there was nowhere to go except into the guns of their enemies. The battle was bloody, brutal, but in the end, the Argosy and Red Hand forces emerged victorious.", "Upon Exsanguinator, Jirrico stared at the burning tomb of a world. His crests were painfully engorged, so much that there were tears in his skin, and blood ran down his scalp. Chrysalis had come, just as the Broken had promised it would. It had arrived, it had turned the tide of battle\u2026", "\u2026and this\u2026 this atrocity was its opening act.", "Before he had time to process the full extent of how the battle has just shifted, more information from his sensors came in.

Compared to them, the bombardments and planetary devastation that the AI could unleash were crude and child-like. The fusion catalyzers that had just turned Zyrmosch into a tiny, self-destroying star were called \u2018lesser nestburners\u2019. They shared certain characteristics with other esoteric technologies that the Compact was familiar with; the Toletta had been developing something similar, but the xenophobic hermits had never succeeded in moving from theory to workable designs.", "Red had once seen a greater nestburner in use. She had hoped to acquire one of those, but even before Echo\u2019s \u2018assistance\u2019, she hadn\u2019t been on good enough terms with Zenobia\u2019s pack to gain access to supernovae-inducers. That was probably for the best. She would have been tempted to use one of them on this system, and the Compact\u2019s response to such an event would be\u2026 incendiary. Igniting Zyrmosch would cause problems on its own, but the Compact could pretend that the Principality was responsible. There was no deniability if Galhem went supernova, and Rally would pay the price. One Compact system, even a lynchpin, was not worth risking humanity\u2019s existence.", "What I\u2019m doing here is antagonistic enough. I don\u2019t need to escalate too much further. Her goal was simple; obliterate everything within Galhemna that the Red Hand and Principality couldn\u2019t. Protect Eisheth and Brightest Night without making it obvious that she was doing so. Initiate Vetala and (of course) survive. Managing all of those tasks together would be difficult, but she was up for the challenge.", "Besides, the AI thought. This time, I have help.", "+sister,+ Red One called across hundreds of millions of kilometers +are you finished?+", "Echo\u2019s response was a bubbling giggle, her transmission including snippets of sensor data, flashes and images of the ships she\u2019d destroyed. While Nemesis had gone after Zyrmosch, Hekate had deployed further out, warping into Zyrmosch\u2019s L1 libration point in hopes of ambushing part of the system\u2019s garrison. She\u2019d succeeded, and while she\u2019d taken some damage from the defences in the libration point, they hadn\u2019t been enough to meaningfully impact her functions, and her self-repair systems were dealing with it and the damage she\u2019d taken from the squadrons she\u2019d obliterated. She was very proud of catching those squadrons, having predicted their course with exceptional accuracy.", "+almost+ Echo added as her ship-self set upon the few survivors and a train of ships fleeing from the planet that her sibling had just ignited.", "The rest of the AI fleet had come out between Zyrmosch and Kanlie. A half-dozen freighters, not including the Naiads who were pretending to be an additional quartet of support vessels. The predator-ships had chafed at such a \u2018safe\u2019 transit \u2013 that kind of thing was for their equivalent of toddlers and young children, and the quartet of adolescents imagined themselves as capable as their more mature siblings. Their role irritated them even more. They wanted their chance to kill \u2013 particularly Ar\u00e1mburu, Masako and Tamerlane. Even though they\u2019d killed Carmesh\u2019s flotilla alongside Bathory and Echo, they\u2019d never left their nebula before and were chafing to start the slaughter. Despite their pleas to join Red and Echo, they didn\u2019t abandon their duties, though.", "The colliers and support ships for Vetala were vulnerable. The Fates, Furies and Coyotes were capable, but there weren\u2019t enough of the strike cruisers to protect Red\u2019s train from a dedicated raid. Four Naiads might not be much, but they would be an unpleasant surprise for any raider\u2026 and the apparent weakness of the train\u2019s defences would certainly encourage a sally. The promise of prey coming to them kept the young predator-ships compliant with their new (albeit temporary) monarch\u2019s orders. Seeing what \u2018the Spearsong\u2019 could do also kept their minds focused. None of them had witnessed her nightmarish battle to save Zenobia, and they\u2019d been agog as they\u2019d watched her destruction of Tower of Obsidian.", "Allyria was standing on Nemesis\u2019s bridge, looking at the spread of debris. The battle for Zyrmosch was still raging; many of the Compact defences had been positioned far enough from the planet that they hadn\u2019t been caught in its immolation, and they were not going down without a fight. The Argosy fleet had taken substantial damage, but they\u2019d broken through the enemy lines in several places, three of the massive battlestations had been crippled or killed, with a fourth about to follow suit. Drones were sweeping minefields to allow the fleet to come closer and use their energy weapons to finish off whatever was left. It would be hours before the outcome was fully determined, but for the moment it looked as if the attackers had won through.", "\u201cAre we winning?\u201d the Verrish asked softly. It looked like they were, but the losses each allied fleet had taken were monstrous. Thank the gods, Brightest Night wasn\u2019t among the casualties. When the AI had shown her that the corvette was still intact and largely undamaged, Allyria\u2019s sense of relief had been overwhelming.", "\u201cFor the moment,\u201d Red replied. \u201cDespite the damage our allies have suffered, the Compact has lost an equivalent amount, though they have reserves to draw upon. Provided that little to nothing else changes in the tactical situation, I would say that our odds of success are very good.\u201d", "\u201cAnd what are the chances of that?\u201d Allyria pressed.", "The AI\u2019s avatar smiled ruefully. \u201cLow,\u201d she informed the young officer. \u201cVery low.\u201d", "~", "Deep within Galhemna\u2019s life zone, the doors to the Tier Seven shipwombs opened. There was less fanfare and ceremony today, but the gravity of the situation was far greater than it had been when Weight of Destiny was launched. There had been no word from and no sign of that Chariot; current speculation was either that it was en route to, or fighting within Natuous. There were other theories, ones that opined a far darker fate. For the sake of morale, these were kept quiet by officers and confessors.", "Resolve of Tithrak was the first to emerge, one of the heaviest known dreadnought class in the galaxy, and a twin to Weight of Destiny. Following it was the Sundering Walls of the Mightiest Fortress-class Shield of Civilization, a purpose-built missile platform. They were both newborns and untested \u2013 but fully crewed and fully operational. Only the heaviest defences, such as citadels like Tower of Obsidian, outgunned them. Each Chariot was a fleet-killer unto itself, capable of laying waste to entire star systems.", "Squadrons of battleships took up formation around the Chariots as they entered open space, hundreds of warships moving towards their distant attackers in perfect unison. Every injury, every insult that the enemy had visited upon the Compact would be repaid tenfold.", "Galhemna had been wounded, but it was not defeated. The enemy had cost them heavily, but spent themselves in doing so. No matter what they had left, it wouldn\u2019t be enough. The beast had been stuck, and blood was flowing.

Those words rang in her ears. No, not different \u2013 similar. They were similar to the people that They were butchering. A new, horrifying mystery to pile atop the others. No one knew anything about Them. They had come to this world less than a season\u2019s segment ago and They had started to kill everyone. Not satisfied with crushing cities with Their arrival or immolating millions with thermonuclear weapons, They were determined to extinguish every beating heart on this world.", "Why? part of Sym-lin\u2019s mind cried out as she pulled herself further up the cliffs.

Hundreds of those massive obelisks had descended upon cities throughout the country, with even more landing outside them. It was an invasion. Millions were dead, tens \u2013 hundreds! \u2013 of millions.", "She\u2019d gotten into her car and sped towards Riyan-la.

It was the only way she could keep going.", "Sym-lin passed other cars on the road. Some were rushing towards the city, others fleeing just as she was.

They were flying up the highways, shooting every vehicle that They came across. Sym-lin saw and heard the line of explosions getting closer. In the distance behind, she could see dark shapes darting back and forth, lines of flames erupting along the ground as They passed. Those shapes were getting closer, very quickly.", "She pulled off the road, pausing just long enough to grab everything she could from her vehicle. Other cars sped by her, blatting their pipes either trying to tell her to get moving, or to pull further onto the shoulder. She was too frightened to do either. With everything that she could carry in her arms, or on her back, Sym-lin abandoned her vehicle, flattening herself under a small outcropping close to the road.", "Most of the vehicles didn\u2019t stop, hoping that they could outrun Their aircraft. Some peeled off the road onto the plains, as if that would save them. Only a bare few stopped, their drivers and passengers getting out and running along the highway, too panicked to do anything else, perhaps thinking that it was only the vehicles that They wanted to destroy. The explosions got closer and louder. So did the sound of the alien crafts\u2019 engines.", "\u201cOver here!\u201d Sym-lin had called. Few people heard her. Fewer acknowledged. A young father with his two sons ran to her, telling his children to hide. He turned back for his wife. She was still in the family\u2019s car, panicking and unable to get herself out. A woman older than Sym-lin, dressed in a suit that cost more than the aerobics instructor made in a week, scuttled into the crevice, her fine clothes getting filthy and torn. An obese man hurried as best he could towards Sym-lin. His chitinous plates were seemingly adrift in an ocean of stretched tegument and he panted and gasped, needing all eight limbs to move himself at speed, but even that was too slow.", "The shriek of Their craft was so loud now. One of alien Thing swept up the road. Hideous beams flicked from Its underside. They left bright after-images in Sym-lin\u2019s vision, and she couldn\u2019t look at them for long. She didn\u2019t want to, anyways. Everything those beams touched died.", "Vehicles melted and fuel tanks ignited. People flashed into nothing, leaving only ashes, charred pieces of bone and bits of exoskeleton behind. The young father was pulling his wife from the car when a beam sliced through the vehicle. There was a gout of flame and both of them were gone. Another beam whickered out and the fat man ignited, transformed into an instant into a charred shadow.", "The wealthy woman was holding onto the newly-orphaned children, her body spasming with terror. Someone soiled themselves. The warm wetness spread over the dusty soil underneath the rock, soaking each of the four survivors. None of them moved for hours, afraid to make a single noise. Finally as night fell, Sym-lin bundled her courage and crawled out. They were alone. Riyan-la City was an orange haze in the distance. Alien Things milled around the towering ziggurat, tiny ones and others much larger. The young woman thought she could hear thunder in the distance, but she knew that it wasn\u2019t thunder.", "The sky was clear and cloudless. The moon was full. Bright lights, like torchwings, flitted high above. There was something else in the sky. It was a shadow moving across the face of the moon. It looked like a swimming bell. It looked like it was no bigger than the tip of Sym-lin\u2019s finger, but at the distance it was from the planet, it had to be monstrously huge. As she watched, another \u2018torchwing\u2019 appeared, falling towards her world from the alien monstrosity. She didn\u2019t see where it came down.", "\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d the wealthy woman asked she came out of hiding, still holding the young boys. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2026\u201d Sym-lin had struggled for an answer.

She had to.", "She\u2019d pointed at the distant, night-shrouded mountains. \u201cWe can go there.\u201d", "That had been more just under a quarter of a segment\u2019s season ago. In the time since, her small herd had increased in size as they came across other survivors. Like Sym-lin herself, most of them had been \u2018lucky\u2019. They hadn\u2019t been in the city when it fell\u2026 when They came. A few had gotten out of Riyan-la. Of those, almost all were from the outskirts and absorbed townships. No one who\u2019d been at the center of the city had survived. They\u2019d either died when the ziggurat came down or\u2026", "\u2026or\u2026", "The escapees from Riyan-la had shared stories. They spoke of horrifying things, of widespread extermination of the citizenry and worse. People being taken, not just killed. Taken into the ziggurat and the other alien buildings that They had made. \u2018There\u2019s no escape,\u2019 one traumatized young man had said. He\u2019d been closer to the ziggurat than anyone else. No one knew how he\u2019d made it this far into the plains or how he\u2019d survived at all \u2026 but he hadn\u2019t. Not really.", "\u2018They take you. There\u2019s no escape.\u2019  That was all he said. Sometimes he added more. \u2018They take you and\u2026\u2019  Then his jaws would lock up, he\u2019d mouth silent words and stare at nothing as whatever horrors followed that and replayed themselves in his mind. They couldn\u2019t get anything else from him. They didn\u2019t even know his name.", "Whatever They were, there was no reasoning with Them. The only thing that They wanted was the death of everyone on this planet. There\u2019d been no warning, no message, no demands. They\u2019d fallen from the sky and started a genocide. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d Hun-jav, the once-wealthy woman that had sheltered with Sym-lin under the rocks, would sometimes say. She still wore the filthy rags of her formerly fine clothes. She kept the two orphaned boys with her, looking after them.", "Sym-lin\u2019s band kept to the cliffs, only venturing into the open when they had to. With her radio, they were able to get some news from the rest of the world. It was fragmented and none of it was good. What had happened in Riyan-la City was happening across the world. After one report about the annihilation of Seco-mon, one of their number \u2013 a tourist originally from that city \u2013 got up. She said she needed some time. They found her the morning after at the bottom of the cliffs.", "These days, there was nothing on the radio. The last report they\u2019d heard had been to stay off the airwaves, that the Invaders were tracking the signals. That message had ended abruptly.", "The days melded into one another. They found a few more survivors, starving and barely alive from wandering in the desert. One of them had been trying to find help for her own herd, but she was now the only one left; by the time Sym-lin and her people found the others, it was too late. In the Wending Cliffs, at least they seemed to be safe. There was water and game. As a survivalist, Sym-lin was a dilettante, but her knowledge gave her people the best chance of surviving. Occasionally, an aircraft would whine by overhead and the survivors would scatter into crevasses, caverns and under rocks, but They didn\u2019t seem interested in the mountains.", "At least, until today.", "Sym-lin thought they\u2019d been careful. Her group had come down from the cliffs to collect the water-root plants she\u2019d taught them look for, and to scavenge for anything that they could find, though the latter efforts were less and less fruitful. Today, it went horribly wrong. They must have been seen; Sym-lin didn\u2019t know how, not that it mattered. A single vehicle, the size of a lorry but without wheels or wings, came surging across the plains. It carried a squad\u2019s worth of Them, the hideous Things disembarking and scouring the area for the survivors. It wasn\u2019t long before they were detected, and as the survivors scuttled and raced for the safety of the cliffs, they were pursued every step of the way.", "They weren\u2019t shooting, nor did They make a single noise. No demands to surrender, no threats or commands in a garbled alien language. Just an onrushing, hideous tide of Things that wanted to exterminate every last trace of life on this planet.", "Sym-lin and her small forage party caught their breath in an alcove. They\u2019d had enough of a head start that they\u2019d managed to elude their pursuers, or so she hoped. \u201cThey\u2019ve changed,\u201d one of the city survivors panted, wheezing through her mouth, her spiracles pulsing. \u201cThey\u2019re different.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t let Them take you,\u201d a young man \u2013 Thim-alu \u2013 said, his entire body shaking.

A pack of Them boiled through the rocks. They were awful and grotesque, but for all the alien horror of Their appearance, Sym-lin saw terrifying similarities in form and function between her people and Them.", "They look\u2026 like us, was her last coherent thought as she led her group up the cliff wall, pursued by alien monsters. Despite losing Yual-ela and Itan-uap, the rest of the forage party managed to reach the rest of the herd, climbing over the embankment but there was nowhere else for them to go. They could run, scatter along mountain trails\u2026 but then they\u2019d be taken one by one, and there was no time for all of them to escape.", "They weren\u2019t going to make it. The shooters had picked off the Things on the cliff, but the vehicle was still there. More of Them crawled out of it, and They were firing back in earnest, now. Wen-rua was shot in the head, a hole burned right through his skull. Shrapnel from exploding rocks showered the survivors, jagged, molten bits of stone searing chitin, punching through skin.", "Thim-alu was blinded in his right eye as a piece of the rock face struck him, a finger-sized piece of steaming, melted stone jutting out of his eye. He screamed in agony, ripping the shrapnel loose and clutching at his ruined face. Uop-yan never made a sound when she died; she just slumped over the edge of the outcropping, her hindmost legs twitching a little. One by one, the rest of their shooters joined her. Soon it was only the huddled throng of unarmed civilians waiting for Them to come up over the rocks and\u2026 and\u2026", "Don\u2019t let Them take you. Sym-lin remembered Thim-ula\u2019s words. She had a utility knife in her survival pack. She pulled it out and looked at it. \u201cWe won\u2019t let Them take us,\u201d she said softly, looking around at the last of her herd. They stared at her, frightened. It was the silent, nameless, broken man who stepped forward, clasping his hands over the young woman\u2019s. His scarred and mutilated antennae twitched in a nod.", "Sym-lin Pa Thren-lin, an aerobics instructor, outdoors enthusiast-turned-leader of this small herd, had never imagined this responsibility, but she had it now. She reached back and pulled the nameless man\u2019s chin up, exposing the soft skin of this throat. Her hands were shaking. He stared at her. \u201cEscape,\u201d he pleaded, but before she could do anything more, someone behind her cried out.", "\u201cThe sky!\u201d", "She looked up. It was raining, but not water. Fire was pouring from the cloudy, sickly-orange sky, dozens of tiny, burning contrails. They roared as they fell towards the ground, growing louder with every second. One of them seared towards the mountain, so close that Sym-lin thought it would strike them, but it disappeared beneath the cliffs. Heartbeats later, the ground shook like a titan\u2019s war-club had been brought down upon it. More impacts followed, near and far, the mountains shaking with every concussion. The survivors lost their grip and fell. Limbs snapped. Rocks tumbled from the cliffs. An entire side of the mountains fell away. Part of the outcropping they\u2019d hidden behind fell away. Hun-jav nearly went with it but for her adopted sons grabbing her, digging their limbs into the heaving ground and refusing to let her fall.", "Sym-lin was still trying to pick herself up when the light came, so she didn\u2019t see it herself, but the two of her party who did were blinded by it. It filled the Riyan Plains like a flash of highest sun chasing away every shadow and trace of darkness. Then, thunder, louder and more terrible than that of whatever bombardment They had unleashed before crashed over the desert scrubland. As the light faded, Sym-lin finally worked up the courage to look out from her hiding spot, curiousity overcoming her fear. Her hearts pounded so loudly that she didn\u2019t hear the cries of the injured or blinded next to her. She had to see. She had to see what had happened to her world now, what They had done.", "With shaking limbs, she lifted herself over the outcropping. Where Their machine and shooters had once been was now a crater, half-covered by the avalanches. There was no trace of any of Them and on the horizon\u2026", "\u2026Riyan-la City was gone. No broken bones of skyscrapers, no diseased haze of smog and alien industry, no horrific ziggurat. In their place was a rising, broad-capped column of fire. Sym-lin raised her eyes to the sky.", "Coming through the cloud layer even more of the rain of fire, more intense with every passing moment. Beams and projectiles, like torches of the gods themselves, lanced down and where they struck, they left nothing. The tales of other survivors told her what she had seen in those moments. Divine retribution as Their armoured vehicles shattered, Their buildings turned to craters, and Their fortresses and compounds were wiped away. An entire hemisphere was burning.", "Then, she saw it. At the edge of the sky, something massive emerged. For several moments, she didn\u2019t know what it was. Then she recognized it from when Its silhouette had crossed beneath the moon. It was Their great ship, and It was on fire. Smoke poured from Its broken hull. It was out of control. Later than she should have, she realized that this new devastation was not Their doing at all. It was something else. Something else was up there, and it hated Them.", "The inferno that was Their vessel was still falling, a fiery meteor that blazed across the skyline in an uncontrolled descent. It passed over the Wending cliffs, so close that Sym-lin thought she could reach up and touch it. She could feel the heat of Its passing and the roar of Its final descent drowned out her exultant, victorious cheer as she watched It die.", "Its course, ever across and always downwards, took it past the mountains, the plains and the inferno that had once been Riyan-la City. It disappeared over the horizon. Moments later, there was fresh thunder, longer and louder as ground shook again with Their ship\u2019s final impact. More moments passed and in the distance, she saw the faint flickers of beams cutting through the clouds, striking where the great ship had fallen. Whoever was up there wanted Them utterly eradicated.", "Sym-lin didn\u2019t how long she watched as more torches fell to the ground. Some were pieces of Them, some were more weapons. In minutes, They had lost half of their ziggurats and thousands of Their vehicles. As the thing above swept around the turning world, that number increased to near-total casualties. What was left was too few to stop the remains of the various militaries from re-taking their world.", "It would turn out that Sym-lin had been the first person to see it happen, and it was from her that the name for the unseen thing that had saved her people would come. In the aftermath and for every day afterwards, every time she looked at the sky she remembered the sight of it aflame.", "~", "A civilization cannot help but announce its presence to others. Sometimes it is a beacon, a sign that whoever sees it is not alone, that there is succor amongst the void and against the odds, another race has grown and thrived. A message of hope and perseverance.", "Other times, just as a light in deep water will attract the curious, it will also draw the attention of predators. This world discovered that to their cost. The beacon they unknowingly lit made them prey for another, more dangerous civilization.", "From what is left of the planetary data net, I\u2019ve been able to determine that pre-contact, the planetary population was over eleven billion. In the span of weeks, nearly sixty percent has been eradicated. That campaign was not random butchery, panic spawned from a sleeper ship\u2019s personnel awakening to find another civilization on their expected new home. The extermination was meticulous and well-coordinated. The crew of the colony ship knew full well what this system held and what they were going to do. That was why they were sent.", "I\u2019ve encountered the Mejjatrythe only once before and though the circumstances were far different, I was left with a\u2026 far from favourable impression. I thought I might have been wrong and my assessment was based on an isolated, corrupted or shunned segment of the species. I\u2019ve taken enough data from their \u2018colonization\u2019 fleet and planetary information nets to know that that isn\u2019t the case. I know what they did to the people here \u2013 those they didn\u2019t kill. This wasn\u2019t just extermination. It was far, far worse. ", "I understand what they did, how they did it and even their own rationale for it. But I do not comprehend the why of it. I wonder if it is because I am not human, and that one of my crew would have better luck. I wonder, but\u2026 I do not think so. I think even they would have been unable to truly understand this species and the atrocities they have chosen to enact. ", "Behind me, the small, brown-green world recedes to nothing. I\u2019ve removed the infestation. They will be able to recover. It will a long, hard process but they will survive their first contact. For that, I am envious. My creators did not. ", "The Mejjatrythe are a small horror in a galaxy filled with them, many of which are larger and far more dangerous, but little horrors can grow to become greater ones if given the time to do so.

Many scholars, priests and historians of the day attributed the decades of war to the appearance of the guest star, even long after its light had faded.", "A less superstitious reading of historical events suggested that the political events leading to the Two Centuries War and the ensuing expansion, colonialism and new wars had been simmering for generations. The supernova had little to do with it, save as a convenient excuse and soon became irrelevant to the feuds, conflicts and aspirations. Despite that, up to today, even if they were no longer regarded with the same degree of mysticism and primitive awe that they had once been, the emergence of new and strange stellar phenomena had remained dire portents across most Vamonoan cultures.", "Kemk was not ordinarily a superstitious man, but today he felt a deep kinship with his distant ancestors and their fear of the new star in their skies. Zyrmosch and all its industry had just been wiped away in the blink of an eye\u2026 or close enough. Dozens of stations, hundreds of ships. Wombs, agricultural facilities, industrial nodes, maintenance stations and more. The planet was aflame. According to all known science, that kind of ignition should not be possible, not that rapidly. The Compact had researched the possibility of creating such \u2018short-burn stars\u2019, but the process was still in the theoretical and planning stages.", "Kanlie\u2019s loss was irksome, but not truly damaging. Zyrmosch was a body blow. And the manner in which it was done\u2026 \u201cI want,\u201d the Bastion Leader had told his silent, speechless staff as they watched a gas giant turn into a new stellar body. \u201cEverything we have on those ships. Everything.\u201d Analysts, officers and submissives scrambled to obey.", "Two new Chariots. The smaller one had shattered Tower of Obsidian and set Zyrmosch aflame. The second\u2026 the second might even be a worse affront. Its form was corrupt, twisted, the gentle curves of its hull butchered by baroque slabs of armour, but there was no mistaking what it was\u2026 what it had been. A Chariot, a Compact Chariot. Kin to the vessels born here at Galhemna\u2026 until it had been seized, mutilated, contaminated by whatever faction had overtaken it.", "Kemk didn\u2019t know under whose sigil those ships flew, but he could guess. They were part of the threat that Yunl\u2019ro had gone to fight; they certainly weren\u2019t Principality or Red Hand. The smaller Chariot\u2019s actions made that clear enough. It had barreled through the terrorist lines like a charging hamesh, and the discharge of its weapon had claimed several of the Unbound ships. An opportunist, then. The timing was no coincidence, though. Collusion between the new arrivals and the Principality was his suspicion. The Jackals had pulled the strings of their varak puppets and elicited the aid of this new faction. He might have underestimated his enemy\u2019s desperation, but there\u2019d been no way to plan for the newcomers.", "If there is some kind of threat to my sector, I need to know about it. Those words he\u2019d uttered more than a year ago echoed within Kemk\u2019s thoughts. I\u2019ve told you all that I can, had been his counterpart\u2019s answer. It hadn\u2019t been enough. Kemk\u2019s own inquiries had yet to bear fruit, but he knew in his liver that what he was seeing here was the whispered \u2018Gravestone\u2019. What it was, where it had come from\u2026 those were questions he would have answers to, but the how of the situation was far less important to the Bastion Leader at the moment than remedying it.", "He had lost the outer system, but the inner worlds contained the vast majority of Galhemna\u2019s military construction, specifically because of this possibility. The enemy had left Zyrmosch behind; the next orbital path they would cross was that of the gas dwarf Opprin, but the weapons production and testing facilities around that world and its moons were for the moment safe. Just as Galhemna\u2019s outermost world, the rocky, icy lump called Harsinninan, was on the other side of the system from where the attackers had emerged, so too had Opprin\u2019s orbit put the gas dwarf far from the invading fleets. Opprin was also not a major industrial hub, prioritizing research, development and experimentation over mass production, although \u2018mass\u2019 was a relative term. Opprin by itself could produce almost as much as some lesser, single-system nations, but it still paled in comparison to the industry of Galhemna\u2019s inner worlds. It was also not a place where starships were built in any great number, and both attackers and defenders assigned in a lower priority in their plans.", "After the debacle over Zyrmosch, Kemk had ordered Opprin\u2019s garrison drawn down to below minimum recommended levels. He would need those ships elsewhere. If the rest of the system fell, Opprin would follow, regardless of how many vessels and citadels he left there. He\u2019d pulled his remaining forces back across the primary asteroid belt to reorganize. Several of his commanders were pressing to attack \u2013 the enemy fleets had suffered tremendous losses, and the presence of two unclassified hostile Chariots and a small support train couldn\u2019t offset the garrison\u2019s numerical advantages.", "Kemk required more data before he would send his ships into that engagement, and his forces were still assembling. He would not allow himself to be defeated in detail. The corrupted Chariot was far more heavily armed than it should have been, it was faster to accelerate and possessed screens even heavier than those of Resolve of Tithrak, slaughtering several dozen heavy capital ships with minimal damage to itself. The remaining support echelons had chosen discretion and disengaged, though they had learned to their cost that the enemy Chariot\u2019s missiles had nearly twice the range that they should have possessed. More data, bought and paid for with the lives of the loyal and the dutiful.", "Currently, the abominate Chariot seemed to be in no hurry, adjusting its course to rendezvous with its smaller cousin, both of them waiting for their support train to reach them.", "Despite its provenance, the corrupted vessel concerned him far less on a tactical level than its smaller, unknown kin. The former was still a Chariot, as much as its form and design had been altered and profaned. He had a baseline to understand and extrapolate its new capabilities. The other unclassified, though\u2026 it had obliterated Tower of Obsidian in as horrific a manner as Kemk had ever seen in all his decades of void combat, and turned Zyrmosch into a funeral pyre. That vessel, above all, he knew he had to kill. He couldn\u2019t risk it striking out in either of those ways again.", "Two Jackal supercarriers and four hundred of their ships. Workable.", "Six hundred terrorist vermin to squash. Easy enough.", "Two unknown Chariots and a handful of support vessels. Concerning, but not a threat to his remaining defences.", "All of those together\u2026 that would take some work. It would be bloody, bloodier than he\u2019d ever imagined or planned\u2026 but it could be done. \u201cHold the walls,\u201d Cortam had told him as she brought her ships forward. \u201cWe\u2019ll let them hit our trenches and then run over them.\u201d She sounded confident, but Kemk knew how rattled she was. If something like Tower of Obsidian could be destroyed that easily, so could her Shield of Civilization and Resolve of Tithrak, but the fleet leader had time to prepare\u2026 if anything could be adequate against that Triarchs-damned horror. They would find out soon, though. Less than a day. Less than a day, and Galhemna would stand or fall.", "Bastion Leader Kemk watched the icons on the main plot, took a breath, and resumed plotting his enemies\u2019 destruction.", "~", "Adrianna handed the datascroll back to the rating with a curt nod. It was her ship\u2019s damage report, mercifully short. Eisheth had taken little injury, but it had gotten bleed-through from its screens that had taken out an augur node. Three injuries, one fatality. It could have been much worse. Half her fleet was either destroyed or so badly crippled that the difference was immaterial. The ranks of her lightest vessels had been hardest hit. Damage that vassa anka or kiran shren could survive meant death or mission-kill for them.", "Tactically, their loss meant little. They were the least-capable combatants in the Red Hand\u2019s fleet, and sacrificing them in battle was preferable to losing the heavier ships. Strategically, however\u2026 they were extremely valuable as pirates and smugglers. They were the means by which the Red Hand funded itself through its extra-legal operations. A cruiser couldn\u2019t slip through a blockade. Eisheth couldn\u2019t conceal millions of credits worth of illicit cargo. The losses suffered today would set the Red Hand\u2019s operations across the Compact back for months, if not years\u2026", "\u2026fortunately, she had a remedy for that. The Red Hand fleet was no longer functional as an effective combat force; too much of their screen had been lost, too many ships damaged. Morale was low. Red Hand discipline was higher than most in the fringe, but even they had a breaking point and taking on two fortified planets was it. She couldn\u2019t ask any more of them. One day, one day the Red Hand would be true army. It wasn\u2019t today, but she was proud of how hard that they\u2019d fought already and made that known to her people.", "\u201cLet them off the leash,\u201d she ordered and her formation dispersed into dozens of raiding squadrons, all of them heading towards isolated outposts, under-defended convoys and any other target of opportunity that the system\u2019s garrison could not or would not spare the ships to protect. After Zyrmosch, Kemk would need every vessel that he could get; he was already pulling garrison forces from other planets and facilities to bolster the armada forming in the inner system.", "Adrianna smiled thinly. The sight of civilian ships being overrun and taken while the Space Force did nothing was a powerful one. Militarily, they couldn\u2019t protect every freighter whose leader\u2019s nerve failed, every convoy willing to take their chances and run, every outpost that had no tactical value \u2013 not with a wraith fleet on their doorstep and the sudden arrival of two titan-scale warships. Emotionally however\u2026 it would play very badly for them with the public and corporate lobbyists who valued their cargoes more than the hundreds of warships that Kemk was trying to protect.", "How unfortunate.", "I do hope no one is recording these events. If that footage got out, it might make people doubt the Space Force\u2019s ineffability. She tapped a finger to her lips. The best way, she felt, would be to let the situation speak for itself. Not removing context or \u2018massaging\u2019 the scenario, but simply showing that the Compact let those it professed to fight for die, sacrificing their lives for the greater good. The cold equations again. Adrianna had learned that few people really understood them. If Kemk attempted to protect everything, he\u2019d end up protecting nothing. Every soldier worth a damn in this system understood that\u2026 but it was a hard thing to swallow nonetheless. Impossible for some. All the more if you were one of those that cold logic and facts said would not and could not be saved.", "As her fleet dispersed into hunting packs, many remained behind to take care of the casualties. Starships that could no longer fight, but were still operational were tasked to assist in recovery and salvage operations, and provide personnel for boarding actions and prize crews. Vessels that couldn\u2019t do either of those, but still had FTL were sent out-system in convoys shepherded by heavier Red Hand warships. Compact reavers were already prowling towards them, set on ambushing the damaged ships and exacting bloody revenge for Kanlie and Zyrmosch.", "Inoperable hulks were divided into those deemed salvageable and those not. The former were taken under tow by tugs and retrofitted carryalls. The latter had everything of value removed and were scuttled. Five hundred and eighty-four ships. Months of plans and operations across the Compact had been abandoned or set back. It would take even longer to regain their strength, if the plunder they took equalled or exceeded what they\u2019d lost. If it didn\u2019t, the Red Hand would be crippled for years. Other cartels would be emboldened by this weakness. Some of the Five might even challenge her directly. All for this, for one single system out of the Compact\u2019s tens of thousands.", "Watching Nemesis cut through space like a broadsword on her way to join her sister, Adrianna knew that it would be worth it. Two of you, she thought in wonder. Now there\u2019s two of you. Sixty years ago, she had first stood upon the decks of a legend. She remembered the sense of awe she\u2019d felt then. She felt it again now. We can win. We can win, and all of this will be worth it.", "A scope officer caught her attention.

He\u2019d managed to get several sensor platforms into the inner system, not that they\u2019d been needed. There was no disguising drive wakes that powerful. The Chariots were operational. They were surrounded by four full squadrons of battleships, with four more such assemblages deployed around those in a screen of titanic firepower and durability.", "Around them were dozens more capitals and nearly eighty escorts. There was as much, perhaps more, firepower in that one flotilla as Jirrico had left to him\u2026 and while his Compact counterpart was pressed for hulls, he was not low on ships. All the operational warships intended for Sundial were on-line, ready to defend themselves and their unfinished kin.", "The raiding squadrons that had been circling Zyrmosch hadn\u2019t disengaged with the rest; they were still ready to run flanking raids and strikes on the Principality forces, keeping a predatory eye on the wraith fleet\u2019s support ships and whatever else they might be able to strike at. Several had broken off to chase after the Red Hand, now that the insurgent fleet was splintering in preparation for widespread reaving and looting. The Red Queen wasn\u2019t going to throw her forces into another meat grinder. Kanlie and Zyrmosch had been enough. Now her ships would take what they could and quit the field.", "Jirrico observed the dispersal of his erstwhile ally\u2019s force without bitterness. He was only surprised it had taken this long. The Red Hand had no place facing an actual military; if that fact was ever in dispute, Zyrmosch put paid to any question. Asking them to engage that wall of guns and armour beyond the asteroid belt was tantamount to suicide. By stripping and plundering everything they could, they\u2019d hurt Galhemna more than snuffing themselves out against a Space Force battle-line. Besides, every ship Kemk had to send to deal with their predations would be one less he had to face down the remainder of Wraith Fleet Severance\u2026 and Chrysalis.", "Along with whatever new horror that it birthed from the Karkun Pits\u2026 he thought. The neverborn had a Chariot of its own now.

They were densely encrypted, impossible to decipher, but the nature of them\u2026 they were not the kind of signals a command ship would send to a drone. There was back and forth, just as two vessels of the same fleet might speak to each other. A conversation\u2026 there was another neverborn aboard that Chariot. He didn\u2019t know how it had happened, where it had come from, but it was there.", "And we helped created it. Just what Chrysalis had needed so much material for was now frighteningly obvious. The machine had kin. It had indeed repaired itself, but it had also stolen a Chariot for its companion\u2019s new body. Ancestors forgive us, he prayed once more. What have we done? A planet was aflame, and that was only the beginning. More would follow. It was everything he\u2019d hoped for. That was sickening part of it. Chrysalis restored, breaching the Compact\u2019s defences and bringing Galhemna to its knees. Everything he\u2019d hoped for\u2026 in the worst way imaginable.", "He took a breath. In a matter of minutes, Operation Hatchling had gone from dire straits, to confused hope, to awe and terror. Their new ally was responsible for that. As much as the sight of the palisade crumpling and the ships and installations around Zyrmosch being swept away in a firestorm had heartened his crews, the how of those instances had also chilled the guts of every soul in the fleet, but there was a belief that whatever their allies were, \u2018at least they\u2019re on our side\u2019.", "Jirrico knew better. Chrysalis and now Cocoon\u2026 and whatever other horrors they had in the rest of their ships, the ones hurrying to catch up to the dreadnoughts. Two titan-scale freighters, nearly a dozen smaller vessels, most of which were some of the very vessels he had sent to the neverborn. There was heavy jamming around that flotilla and any drone \u2013 Compact or Principality \u2013 that ventured near was picked off long before it could peel back the layers of ECM. He pressed his double thumbs into the palms of his hands. Whatever was inside those ships, he doubted that he\u2019d like it. No, he didn\u2019t at all share in his crews\u2019 cautious elation.", "Eisheth was not accepting communications from him. It was not often that a Noble Fleet Lord of the Askanj Principality Argosy suffered someone ducking contact, but that was exactly what was happening. The very junior insurgent officers he had spoken to were unfailingly polite, but insisted that the Red Queen was currently \u2018in conference\u2019 coordinating fleet operations. The Red Hand had suffered heavy damage, the officers were quick to remind Jirrico, and as soon as their monarch was available again, they would pass along his \u2018requests\u2019. His request was a demand to speak to not only to her, but her associates, the neverborn\u2019s toys.", "Did you know? He wanted the answer to that question very badly. Did you know there was another? A lie of omission was still a lie, and if the Broken had lied to him\u2026 if Leblanc had known\u2026 if they\u2019d let him fuel a second of these monstrosities\u2026", "The fleet lord took a breath. Whatever had happened, the repercussions would have to wait. Here and now, Galhemna was not yet broken and it had to fall. Whatever else Chrysalis had done, they would have to deal with that after Sundial was cast down and the Compact was pushed onto the defensive.", "Severance was badly damaged. Most of his screening elements were gone. The Zyrmosch garrison had targeted those ships. They\u2019d known that they wouldn\u2019t be able to destroy his fleet on their own, so they\u2019d stripped away his escorts to deny his larger ships their protection, making him more vulnerable to flanking assaults, stealth attacks and eroding the depth of his defensive envelope. The Argosy\u2019s missiles traditionally outranged those of the Space Force, but recently the Compact had unveiled new, heavy capital missiles. They were too large to mount on anything smaller than a battlecruiser\u2026 such as the pair of Chariots accelerating towards him from the inner system.", "The garrison had known exactly what they\u2019d been doing, hounds biting into a galamor\u2019s limbs and underbelly to bleed and weaken it before the hunters drove their spears into it. He should have been unconcerned; Chrysalis on its own had killed Chariots and from what his sensors could tell, its kin was upgraded beyond what a \u2018mere\u2019 Compact Chariot could do. He should have felt at ease. If it had only been those two enemy Chariots, he supposed he would have.", "\u2026but it was not just them. It was an entire armada of the heaviest warships that Galhemna had at its disposal. They\u2019d seen their comrades die, they\u2019d seen what Chrysalis had done to Tower of Obsidian and its incineration of Zyrmosch. They\u2019d been given time to get over their shock, for discipline to be re-established and to formulate a plan of attack and to drown their attackers in battle steel, Argosy, Red Hand and neverborn alike.", "The loss of a third of his fleet would, under other circumstances, be a reason for withdrawal. Not today. Not with this system unbroken and hundreds of warships still in their cradles, waiting to be used against him.", "Wraith Fleet Severance passed through the asteroid field, towards the guns of the enemy. Jirrico watched the plot update, the minutes ticking by.

Nemesis was crossing the mid-system asteroid field. There were no hostiles nearby, and the dreadnought was surrounded by an armada of sensor platforms and hunter-killer drones. Even the most advanced cloaking systems would be hard-pressed to get through the warship\u2019s perimeter without being detected.

Especially since Grace was out there, on a tiny corvette. Riding Nemesis into battle had underscored just how fragile Brightest Night was in comparison. Zyrmosch\u2019s defenders had hit the dreadnought several times, more than enough to repeatedly destroy something like Brightest Night. Nemesis had barely registered damage to her shields. Grace was out there in a small, damaged corvette\u2026 and Allyria couldn\u2019t even talk to her.", "Red One wouldn\u2019t send any transmissions to any of the Red Hand. Her presence here was enough to incite the Compact more than she had in centuries, especially since Hekate was operational and active. Any hint of collusion between herself and the Red Hand beyond predatory happenstance was an intolerable risk. Red One had to appear to be using them for her own ends, with no indication that she or Echo cared one whit about any of the living creatures aboard those ships\u2026 even if two of them were very precious to the machines and even if Allyria desperately wanted to hear the voice and see the face of one of those two. At least she knew that Grace was all right; Nemesis had intercepted Red Hand comm chatter, including transmissions from Brightest Night.", "The Verrish closed her eyes. She was too wound up to sleep, or so she thought. Below the pitch of human hearing, she heard a soft, low hum. It was like the sleep-purrs of her mother or father when she lay next to them, a sound that every young Verrish knew instinctively, a sound she hadn\u2019t heard for decades.

The ancient vessel had been salvaged centuries ago and largely ignored as little more than a trinket, its gravity drive the only real point of interest about the vessel, but the impracticality of using it to any real tactical benefit had seen it languishing with other oddities in a deep-space cache far from any star. It wasn\u2019t until the last century that Ghede Nibo had been brought to the Black Veil, with a keener interest taken in the possibilities of its propulsion system. Several potential uses had been devised, but this was its primary one.", "The civilization that had first created the gravity-drive vessel was gone, rendered extinct millennia before the Compact had arisen. Red One had once asked Zenobia if the Naiads had had a hand in that, but the response was the equivalent of an uncaring and uncertain shrug. There were more Naiads than just those within the Molten Veneer, and more threats among the stars than just the predators. Ghede Nibo\u2019s final imperative was a direct response to one of those other dangers.", "The Compact scouts pushed ever-nearer. In minutes they would be within weapons range of the small, unfinished minefield. Their sensors greedily licked and poured over the ships here and the great ring, trying to prise secrets out of both. Finally, they crossed a threshold, drawing just close enough to trigger a sequence of responses within the vessels clustered about the ring.", "It was time. The nameless drone intelligence at the heart of Ghede Nibo acknowledged that its death had come without emotion. It was only a machine and it had been given a purpose. That purpose would be fulfilled. Whether or not it meant the ship\u2019s destruction was irrelevant. The dreadnought-sized vessel began to shunt power into its engines, but it did not move. It sent a signal to the vessels gathered around it, announcing and confirming their own fates. No more research. No more study, no more analysis or construction. With as little interest in their impending annihilation as Ghede Nibo itself, they followed the directives that the gravity ship passed on to them.", "There was a single, small touch of theater in this. A secret message that would never be understood or even heard by those that had set this action in motion.

They chased after freighters, pounced upon civilian stations, clashed with corporate security and the Compact squadrons prowling beyond the asteroid belt, sometimes losing and sometimes winning these fierce running battles.

She wanted to feel the enemy Chariots break under her assault, to reduce them to spinning, misshapen wreckage just as she and her sister had done to Weight of Destiny. This was not an ambush of an unsuspecting god-ship, though. Those vessels were newborn, but they would not have been launched unless they were crewed and expected to perform at full capability. Nemesis and Hekate each outgunned one of those warships, but the Compact\u2019s Kaiju had hundreds of vessels and fortresses in support of them.

That was rational, and based upon the evidence at hand. Why show us this? That was a question that was more troubling. The machine could have put its industrial power anywhere, but it had chosen Cemetery. There were thousands of star systems within the nebula, possibly dozens that met the same astrographical qualities as this one\u2026 but this was the one that it had chosen. Logically, the answer was that there was something about the ring that made Cemetery desirable. It was being harvested for material, it provided a type of substrate upon which more facilities could be built, it had some esoteric function not yet revealed\u2026", "But there was a thought that had wormed its way into her mind, of her and the millions of souls in her execution force seated in an opera house.

Not here.", "The dreadnought-sized vessel\u2019s drive activated, but Ghede Nibo did not move. Instead of locomotion, it projected its gravity field around itself, forming an artificial gravity well. It was far from a simple or straightforward task. Doing so had required a great deal of experimentation and research, with the results still uncertain. Much of the vessel\u2019s internal superstructure had had to be removed, with the necessary exotic, experimental and unstable systems inserted in its stead. Its hull and shields were substantially weakened by the modifications, but it was not supposed to find itself in a situation where that would matter.

Each burst was stronger than the last, like the waves of a gathering storm crashing across a breach. Throughout Ghede Nibo, systems overloaded and failed. Any other vessel would have killed itself already, but Red\u2019s modifications would keep the salvaged alien derelict alive. Hopefully long enough.", "Emergency venting began, radioactive plumes hundreds of meters long spewing into the void, but it was already too late.

Those vessels not defending Nibo clamped themselves onto many of the structures they\u2019d built, hooking themselves in. Power cables, drills and ambulatory arms extended, using or creating breaches in the hull. Beneath the meters-thick plating of the ring, the invaders found their target: the massive power distribution system that ran throughout the ring. They connected to it, the starships pouring their reactors into alien power grid, exploiting the decades of study made to the construct.", "Hull plates began to buckle and twist.

It re-routed power through secondary transfer lines. Damaged subsystems were shut down, sacrificed to keep the greater whole functioning. Parts of its own hull imploded, crushed in on themselves from the gravitic stress it was producing.

Now, it was being dragged to wakefulness. Sensing damage to its extremities, a compromised outer hull and invasive technology within itself, the construct initiated a pre-programmed defensive sequence, one that required no input from its struggling mind. The extent of the damage was moderate, but it would soon become high and from there, extreme. Its function was in danger. Sleeping reactors were hurried online, bypassing normal safety protocols to provide power for an immediate and severe retaliation.", "That was a mistake.", "The ring\u2019s power transfer systems were already overburdened by the starship reactors feeding into it. The abrupt influx of energy from multiple additional reactors was too much for it to handle. As its intelligence stabilized and realized what was about to happen, a countermand order flashed out, demanding that the reactor output be diverted to the secondary power transfer grid. The full state of the secondary grid was unknown, but it was not overburdened as the primary was and that was what mattered.", "Racing through the confines of the mechanism\u2019s own circuitry, a host of invasive and hostile programming descended on the countermand order, intercepting it before it could reach the engineering subsystems. The countermand howled, twisted and fought against the unexpected infections. They were crude, made from studies of dormant and inactive technologies and built from extrapolation and guesswork. The countermand broke out of their grasp. The delay had only been a matter of milliseconds, but it was enough. Reactor after reactor began dumping their output into the construct\u2019s power girl. It was too much, too fast.", "The power grid couldn\u2019t handle the overload. Secondary systems attempted to drain power, safeties attempted to engage. Physical interlocks were jammed or blocked. More hostile scrapcode struck at the power transfer and safety subsystems, delaying their responses, just as they\u2019d done with the countermand order. At full power, this assault would have been brushed aside, but the mechanism was not at full power. Half-asleep, damaged and the victim of decades of careful study, it could do little.", "Explosions burst through weakened hull plating. Conduits melted. Entire sections were irradiated into ruin. Internal supports and superstructure were sheared away. And still Ghede Nibo pulled, clawed, ripped at it. A small star, now.", "Stellar detritus began to shift orbit, perturbations spreading throughout the system as the new gravity well affected the orbit of everything around it. Ghede Nibo\u2019s breach core was at its limits. It had moments, maybe minutes left to it, but the ship was still not yet ready to die. It had its duty. A simple overload of its core wouldn\u2019t be enough. That would have been noticed, eliciting a defensive response. The ring had to die, but it had to be crippled first. Force it awake. Use its own systems against it. Break it, then kill it.", "Parts of the ring started to bend, bulging and twisting as they were pulled towards Ghede Nibo. Orders and imperatives raced through more than three thousand kilometers of its body, all desperate, all too late, all useless. Reactors breached, atomizing dozens of kilometers of structure with each ignition. The ring was dying, dragged fighting and shrieking into oblivion, but it refused to go quietly or easily. Hull plates shifted, wrenching the infecting technology off its surface, pulverizing the starships or throwing them clear. Silos opened. Crackling lightning cleaved through shields and metal, slicing hulls open. It tried to kill Ghede Nibo, but the gravity well bent its fire away from its killer and what got through wasn\u2019t enough. In the end, it didn\u2019t matter.", "Birth of Strength and Duty was torn from its cradle, thrown towards the center of the ring, spinning end for end before it crashed into Ghede Nibo\u2019s engines, crippling several and damaging its original reactor. The gravity spikes stopped. The destructive, inescapable pull faded to nothing. An instant passed, stretching into another and another. The ring; torn, brutalized\u2026 intact. The last of Red\u2019s fleet; wreckage and motes of dust. Ghede Nibo; crippled, with a final duty.", "Then: breach.", "UECNS Hekate had been taken intact by the Compact, Red Two cut screaming from her ship-self to allow the alien engineers a chance to examine the dreadnought without its AI. The technology of a Nemesis-class deep space fleet engagement vessel was novel to them, the breach core and displacement engine of exceptional interest. Bolstered by their early successes of using the former without an AI, a low-power test of the latter was scheduled. Only a handful of records of the event were recovered.", "The release of a shockspace breach was how planets died, moons unravelled and stars cried out in agony. This was what was unleashed now. Reality, for the briefest of instants, broke apart. The ring shattered, its remaining reactors going critical. There was a flash of light, more brilliant than any sun. A pulse of radiation and annihilated matter swept out like the breath of a supernova. When it faded, there was nothing left of the ring, the minefield or Red\u2019s starships. It was as if a great hand had reached out of the stars and scooped all of them away, leaving only a ragged, empty sphere behind.", "Two of the scouts had been utterly destroyed. The others had been on the very edge of the breach\u2019s release, all damaged to various degrees, torn, irradiated and flensed by Ghede Nibo\u2019s final duty and by the ring\u2019s death spasm.", "In the silence on Light of Judgement\u2019s bridge, Nasham was the first to speak. \u201cDo you understand, Bastion Leader?\u201d he said softly, respectfully. \u201cDo you understand what she just said to us?\u201d There was a light in his eyes, the same one that had been there after Invida and Bequeathed.", "Yunl\u2019ro looked down at the young man. \u201cI believe I do,\u201d she answered. The Wound could have destroyed that facility in many different ways, but it had chosen the most violent, most destructive method possible. The one that would leave absolutely no trace of anything behind. Logic said that this meant the facility had been too valuable to risk its capture and needed to be utterly erased if it fell. Intuition told her that this had been the performance that she\u2019d been expecting, that this was the reason they\u2019d been brought to this system.", "It wanted us to see this. It wanted us to get close enough to see it die and know there was nothing left.", "The same question as before remained, though. Why?", "For that, she had no answer. Yunl\u2019ro ordered rescue operations for the ships of her scouting force still alive, dispatching others to scour the remainder of the system. Her job was not over yet. Their targets were still loose, the nebula was still largely unexplored. The campaign would continue. Until an actual victory.", "We are the toys of the gods.", "The thought crept into her mind and though she tried to dismiss it, it remained, skulking in the back of her thoughts as her task force between to sweep Cemetery for any traces of the Wound, up until the courier arrived. It was the only survivor of four, all sent to find her. The message it carried was one of disaster.", "Yes, thought Yunl\u2019ro angrily, her dark eyes narrowing as she listened to the courier\u2019s desperate transmission. Toys indeed.", "Kursk had been meant to bleed the Compact. It had succeeded. It had been meant to make them think Red and her sister were dead or crippled. It failed. There had been a final intent to it, a message to be sent. Whether that succeeded or failed was yet to be seen."]}

From this distance, Galhemna was barely larger than any other star, a bright yellow speck amidst the cold white light of its neighbours. Dark asteroids and comets, beginning their centuries-long fall towards the star drifted out here, but nothing else. Scope drones flitted ahead of the warships, augurs straining to isolate anything from the expanding darkness, but there was nothing. Across the system, more squadrons performed the same, fruitless work.", "Augurs swept across the darkness, searching but finding nothing. No bleeding of waste heat, no sign of a distortion drive firing to make a minor course correction, no twinkling of distant stars as a stealth field or darkened hull passed between them and the watching eyes, no whispers of comm lines or  faint radio bursts as the hidden vessels spoke to each other and their distant allies. They were here, though. They had to be.", "Debris had been found close to the site of the shockpoint. Too small to be starships, initial analysis suggested heavy capital missiles, perhaps torn loose from the realspace emergence. There was no further sign of the craft that had carried them. More than a hundred of Galhemna\u2019s defenders had been sent out to find and intercept these new arrivals, diverted from the front lines of an increasingly volatile situation to prevent flanking or blitz attacks while the bulk of the fleet was elsewhere. This was exactly the kind of thing that the Jackals would do. Misdirection, deceit, traps and ambushes were the watchwords of their fleet. They had to be stopped\u2026 but first, they had to be found.", "For years, there had been rumours of Argosy vessels with advanced stealth capabilities, with the number of possible sightings, encounters and gossip increasing over the last several months. Captured databases and information from prisoners hinted at something more than rumour, though: the Principality was on the verge of a quantum leap in cloaking technologies.", "With every new incident, the pattern became clearer: ambushed expansion forces, annihilated reconnaissance squadrons, ghost fleets striking at forward bases within supposedly secure systems, sightings of new and as-yet unclassified Argosy hull types, enemy vessels eluding pursuit with only the smallest opportunities, repeated misidentification of enemy combat vessels even under optimal conditions. It all pointed to their enemy using stealth and ECM systems far more effective than any seen before, though on a limited scale.", "The upswing in encounters \u2013 verified or not \u2013 suggested that they\u2019d largely finalized their designs and had moved from laboratory and controlled tests to field and combat trials. From there, it would move to mass production. That, too had been noticed: Argosy worlds ramping up production queues, increased security, deployment of massive jamming systems to hide whatever was being built.", "Military intelligence suspected that only a few of these new warships were currently operational. Casualties were unknown, but at least half were believed to have been lost, although that was likely due to the high risk of their combat trials rather than any technical flaw. The lack of hard data was an ongoing concern; despite several encounters with suspected next-generation Argosy warships, the Compact had yet to recover any examples of the new technologies, but Command did not doubt that they existed. The Argosy was playing for time with a desperation far beyond their normal holding actions and defensive stances. Twice, they had pushed back Compact incursions into industrial regions, losing so many ships that one of those occasions, the Principality lost substantial territory in order to protect a sector of comparatively limited strategic value.", "The responding squadrons\u2019 inability to locate the these arrivals was taken as additional proof of this new technology at work. The Principality would use everything at their disposal to eliminate Sundial, but as the hours passed, the irritation of the Compact leaders grew. They were chasing varak as the rest of Galhemna bled. It was not until after the light of Zyrmosch\u2019s ignition into a new star reached them that their directives were superseded. The orders came from Sacrament of Iron and Bastion Leader Kemk himself, and were very simple: return at all speed.", "Abandoning their search for these as-yet-unseen intruders, the squadrons turned back towards the light of the system\u2019s primary. Every ship was needed, and the reality of their situation became clear. Whatever these ships were or what they were doing, they had drawn nearly a hundred of Galhemna\u2019s garrison far out of position. There was even talk amongst the squadrons\u2019 officers that this had been the goal all along. Regardless of the enemy\u2019s intent, while these hostiles posed a grave threat to as-yet untouched outposts, colonies and shipping, the danger of the wraith fleet and the new, unclassified arrivals superseded all other concerns.", "The Compact squadrons raced sunward, towards the embers of what had once been a world and the hundreds of enemy warships that still lived and were still determined to tear down everything that the Space Force sought to protect. They raced towards that enemy, hoping that they were not consigning those left behind them to death for nothing and hoping even more that they would be in time to affect the outcome.", "~", "\u201c\u2026and so will you.\u201d The transmission from the unclassified hostile Chariot was, like the rest of its actions in Galhemna, without subtlety or the slightest chance of misinterpretation.", "Bastion Leader Cortam Ushan Tyro Henla Danri Sanek Fircom Lalen\u2019s four eyes narrowed. She had just heard the death cries of Weight of Destiny. It should not have been shocking, not with what she had already witnessed. Tower of Obsidian had been larger and more heavily armed, and Zyrmosch was a world\u2026 and yet, Chariots were fleet-killers, instruments of war capable of crushing entire star systems and humbling the proudest of the Compact\u2019s enemies. They were a symbol of her nation\u2019s might and will to expand\u2026 their destiny. To hear such a thing die, to listen to Culm\u2019s last, rushed orders as his command was torn apart around him\u2026 it gave Cortam both a moment of pause and a moment of fear before a deep, cold rage bubbled up from her liver, overriding both.", "She would not allow this to continue. Galhemna had been invaded, violated, by vermin and scavengers. The garrison had been pushed back, and Sundial itself was imperiled. It was all but blasphemous. It had to end. It would end.", "\u201cBastion Leader to all squadrons,\u201d she sent to her vessels. \u201cOur new foe has spoken; are we not afraid? They have stricken a citadel, scorched a planet, wear the husk of one of our Chariots and now claim to have destroyed Weight of Destiny. We should be deeply fearful, quavering at their approach...\u201d she paused, her lips curling back from her sharp white teeth with contempt. \u201cOr rather, we shall kill them. They have abilities we have not seen before, but they have limits as well. The unclassified did not engage Zyrmosch\u2019s defences itself. It did not launch its incendiary weapons the instant it came into range. It wants us to ignore that. It wants us terrified before its approach, so that we do not think, only react.", "\u201cFear is understandable, given what it has done. I have no doubt this new foe will have more surprises for us. There will be losses, but we will overcome. For six thousand years the Space Force has warded the worlds of the Compact. We do not give in to fear. We overcome it and we face our enemies, known and unknown alike, with courage and honour.", "\u201cAttend to your duties, trust in your leaders and recognize that whatever our foe is capable of, they did not come here alone. They did not face us by themselves. They are few, and need the support of their allies. We have broken the Jackals time and again. Today, their treachery may have surprised us, but they have no more gambits to play. Now, they must face us on our terms\u2026 and we know how that ends, do we not?

He\u2019d had a separate comm array installed for this mission.  The neverborn was well outside real-time range, but it frequently laced its transmissions with infective programs. In addition Exsanguinator\u2019s own specialists, he\u2019d brought two of Kebrak Daun\u2019s four noble-rated uplinks for Operation Hatchling because of that risk. When the machine was close enough, they would still be little more than useless, but in other circumstances\u2026", "Just as he tried to plan for all contingencies, he knew his mechanical \u2018ally\u2019 was doing the same. Despite the convergence of their goals, Chrysalis and the Principality had a wind-swept relationship; since the Betrosha Nebula incident, that had only turned more tumultuous. The neverborn had to know what he was considering, and what better way to prevent that than by seeding his fleet with an infection? It had already done the same to the Space Force. His computer security teams and Uplink Sees Through Reeds had discovered fragmented pieces of malefic code within the message it had sent to the enemy fleet.", "By themselves, they seemed to be nothing more than inert, harmless pieces of junk data that looked like the normal signal degradation from a transmission crossing tens of millions of kilometers, but they were not. He\u2019d like to think it was because his personnel were so attentive that these program fragments been detected, but these infections were tailored for Compact computer systems, not Principality. Those fragments were specifically designed not to trip standard Compact safeguards, to remain useless, scattered bits of signal noise that would be subject to a routine systems purge\u2026 until they weren\u2019t. Until they became something else.", "His people hadn\u2019t been able to tell him what that \u2018something else\u2019 could be, but it didn\u2019t matter. The neverborn spoke with a barbed tongue. Every precaution had to be taken to make sure that it didn\u2019t cut his people.", "Jirrico rose from his command throne, standing next to the chosen console. He hesitated only a second before he pressed the play button. The machine always took a woman\u2019s voice, one that matched the species it expected to be speaking to. Jirrico wondered if that was an affectation, a psychological manipulation or if the neverborn actually thought itself to be female. He supposed it didn\u2019t matter either.", "He listened to what it had to say. His lips drawing back from his flat, square teeth in an aggressive grin. \u201cYes,\u201d he agreed softly, under his breath. \u201cYes, we can do that.\u201d", "~", "The distance continued to close by thousands of kilometers every moment. The Compact fleet had grown by another thirty vessels, nearly six hundred and fifty ships now. Attack squadrons were dashing in to harry the flanks and rear of the wraith fleet, trading one or two salvos before withdrawing. Their goal wasn\u2019t to inflict damage. It was to force the Argosy to stay on high alert for hours on end, to keep their defences up on all facings rather than produce a single unified wall to the sunward armada.", "Debris from the reavers that had attacked Nemesis and Hekate\u2019s support train glittered in the sun. One of them had gotten close enough to be boarded by Tamerlane. There wasn\u2019t so much as an aborted transmission to hint at what had happened upon that vessel, but Red One could guess. She\u2019d experienced something similar, remembering the feel of boarding tendrils bursting through armour that would have withstood continent-killing firepower, disgorging swarming hordes of symbiont-constructs into her inner hull. It was enough to almost make her feel sympathy for the alien crew.", "Almost.", "A second, larger squadron of the enemy was even now closing on her support vessels, though they were moving more cautiously than their predecessors. The fate of the first group had checked their rush. They would still attack, but they wouldn\u2019t expect an easy victory this time. They didn\u2019t yet understand how badly they were outclassed against her strike cruisers and the Naiads. They\u2019d learn.", "Tactical simulations, psychological assessments, internal production queues, repair status, performance metrics and a thousand other thoughts ran in parallel through the AI\u2019s mind. She saw how the fleet before her could act; remaining as single solid wall, splitting to confront her forces and those of the Argosy, turning to engage one or the other with everything they had. Squadrons moved, choices split and possibilities played out before her as the aggression, caution, discipline of her opponents fluctuated, even down to the possible reactions of specific individuals. To her opponents, it often seemed as if the AI was prescient, predicting their maneuvers and strategies like a oracle tracing the threads of fate, but that wasn\u2019t it at all.", "It was just what she was. Built for war, to do what no human or organic mind ever could. Probabilities, born, analyzed and discarded by the hundreds and thousands with every passing second. Fuelled by two millennia of experience and fed by the data harvested by her own sensors and recon platforms, prising secrets from the shape of engine emissions, the chatter between starships, their positioning, their hull type and the way they moved. No, it wasn\u2019t prescience. It only seemed like that to smaller, slower minds. Red One knew that she wasn\u2019t infallible. More than once, her predictions had been proven wrong in whole or in part, sometimes to calamitous effect and she had nearly been destroyed because of that. She predicted. She analyzed. She intuited and often, she guessed.", "While a portion of her mind ruminated on that, Red One\u2019s greater attention was focused onto the oncoming battle. The range continued to dwindle, approaching a hundred million kilometers. Calculations flashed through her thought processes, acceleration curves, expected velocities and a new sequence of mathematical thresholds. Deep within her ship-self, a massive warhead was racked into a kilometers-long firing tube.", "With a flare of electromagnetic energy so intense that it temporarily blinded her own sensors, Nemesis sent the first of her twenty-one impactors hurtling towards the enemy. Cooling and repair systems activated, recalibrating the mass driver and venting the enormous waste heat into space. Thirty-three seconds later, her second Ukonvasara deployed and another impactor was spat forth.", "She did not fire her third, preferring to hold and wait to observe the effects of the first two. It wouldn\u2019t take long.", "~", "The first impactor carried a Xiuhcoatl-class warhead, a device whose origin stretched back nearly two and a half millennia to humanity\u2019s first imaginings of spaceborne weaponry. Although the theory behind the Xiuhcoatl would easily have been understood by the scientists and engineers of that era, the technology behind it might as well have been as magic as the weapon carried by Huitzilopochtli himself.", "As soon as it was safely away from Nemesis, the impactor\u2019s own drive ignited in a wash of spatial distortion and it began to accelerate towards its targets. It would eventually reach nearly ninety-two percent of light speed. At that velocity, its maneuvering was limited, but that speed was also its primary defence. Its targets had very little time to react to its approach. Unlike other impactors, the Xiuhcoatl didn\u2019t carry an extensive array of maneuvering thrusters or engines capable of making a second attack run if it missed its target. They were superfluous.", "The impactor\u2019s target was nearly a hundred million kilometers away. Light would take five minutes and thirty-three seconds to cross that distance. Allowing for time to accelerate to terminal velocity, the impactor would take just over six minutes to reach its targets. The Compact would have a window of approximately thirty seconds to react. The vessels that hunted the Wound knew of its hellebores and the carnage that they could wreak, turning starships to vapour beyond any possible risk of retaliation. Even planets were not safe; a single impactor strike was an extinction event unto itself. Enough of them would turn worlds to rubble.", "Evasion protocols were hard-wired into every ship of every fleet that hunted the human warship, ready to respond to the detection of hellebore launches faster than the organic helm crew could, slewing thousands and millions of tonnes of starship away from the incoming missile, hopefully enough that the warheads\u2019 tracking systems and maneuvering thrusters could not compensate and redirect its flight. The Compact garrison, unaware of what they were facing, had no such precautions. They were familiar enough with mass rounds \u2013 railguns and coilguns were standard fare aboard most modern combat vessels. The Principality made extensive use of both for extreme-range saturation bombardments, but a launch from this range was until now completely unprecedented against mobile targets. There was simply no way for a ballistic round to hit a maneuvering target at this kind of distance.", "Powerful sensors guided the impactor towards its target and its engine array was smaller and far less capable than those of its less-specialized counterparts, it was more than enough. The first Xiuhcoatl shrieked through the haphazard defensive fire pouring from the escort screen, itself almost as large as some of those vessels. It weaved and jinked such as it could, just enough to evade the few defensive missiles that happened to approach its flight path, the impactor flashing through the fleet\u2019s perimeter\u2026", "\u2026and for the briefest of instants, a new star was born. Even Nemesis could never guarantee skin-to-skin hits against starships moving up to a fifth the speed of light. That was why standard impactors carried antimatter reactors, power source and warhead both. When they detonated, they created an apocalyptic nova that annihilated everything within hundreds to thousands of kilometers. Even being grazed by the edge of that energy burst was enough to cripple smaller starships, and only the largest could endure more than a single blow.", "Xiuhcoatl impactors did not function as their less exotic kin did. Their explosive yield was smaller, their sensors keener. Within their armoured hull were hundreds of pieces of what in another age, would be known as Casaba howitzers, the same kind of technology that went into modern missiles. They were what the weapon traded its thrusters for, gamma-ray lasers powered by an exploding warhead. The first, most primitive versions had been fuelled by nuclear weapons. These were fed from a far more potent source. As the impactor neared its target the weapons lenses shifted, each aiming towards the dozens of starships around it.", "Instead of the all-consuming blast of a standard impactor\u2019s warhead, the Xiuhcoatl\u2019s detonation was channeled into the hundreds of lasing rods surrounding its reactor. These were incinerated within microseconds, but they survived just long enough to convert the energy pulse of the blast into high-energy gamma rays that slashed across hundreds of thousands of kilometers. Each beam was only a fraction of the warhead\u2019s power, most of it wasted in its detonation. Most of them missed. The weapon was moving too fast, its sensors not given the time they needed to peel through hostile jamming, for targeting systems to lock down courses and movement patterns of the enemy starships. Only a quarter of the beams \u2013 perhaps even fewer than that \u2013 struck their targets and of those that did, few were direct hits. Heavier ships would have shrugged off much of the damage, the beams too few and two scattershot to breach their screens.", "Despite all of that, the result was still more than satisfactory.", "The beams overpenetrated the Compact screens. Expecting incoming railfire and missiles, the escorts of the in-system garrison had focused their screens\u2019 power to the fore, weakening the coverage on their flanks and rears, but even if the screens on those facings had been at full strength, it would have made no difference. Destroyers shattered. Light cruisers slewed drunkenly, their hulls raked open as if by invisible talons. Frigates went dark, falling out of formation. In an instant, nearly twenty starships had been damaged or destroyed.", "The second mass round hurled itself into the gap in the enemy formation, its own self-annihilation just as violent as the first and a fresh salvo of gasers slashed out. Vessels that had survived the first barrage fell victim to the second. Injured ships broke apart. Starships staggered and hemorrhaged parts of themselves as their armoured hulls were shredded, decks laid open to space, vital systems and crew were reduced to stripped atoms or thrown into the void.", "Tens of millions of kilometers away, Red One noted the damage to the enemy formation. Not enough. She had only a few specialty impactors. She loosed the third of her four Xiuhcoatls, holding the last one back, once again waiting to determine the results.", "Aboard Resolve of Tithrak, Bastion Leader Cortam saw the danger immediately. A meteor cannon, she thought. The unclassified was a siege engine, and it was using those Triarchs-damned meteor cannons to open a hole in her screen. More than four hundred ships, fifty-six battleships of them battleships, still lay between the Chariots and their enemy, but she didn\u2019t believe for one second that that was the only weapon the enemy had. If it had bomb-pumped lasers, then it had the bombs to go with them, and she couldn\u2019t allow her battleships to take that kind of fire.", "Once her screen was down, the enemy would use those cannon and its missiles against her heavier units, thereby exposing the Chariots to its shock weapon. Whoever was in command aboard that monstrosity, they knew what they were doing.", "At least, to some extent. They might have\u2026 yes.", "Cortam studied the plot. The corrupted Chariot was cutting thrust, dropping back towards their van. The pair of Chariots had pulled too far ahead of it, and though the support flotilla\u2019s escorts had seen off two attempts to destroy it, they had taken damage themselves. A sufficiently heavy assault would be able to break through the handful of defenders and get at the transports. Normally, she would not continue to throw lives into the Black Pit, but she needed to keep the Chariot\u2019s attention focused behind rather than to the fore. In its haste to get to grips with her ships, the smaller dreadnought was pulling farther and farther ahead. In minutes it would be outside the Chariot\u2019s counter-missile envelope, and shortly after that it would be beyond its larger counterpart\u2019s support range.", "We will burn? The Tribune thought. Yes, perhaps. But you will too.", "\u201cIncrease acceleration on Echelon Three,\u201d Cortam ordered. Those were the heaviest vessels of Security Force Cortam, her ad hoc fleet\u2019s designation. \u201cEchelon Two will match Three\u2019s. Echelon One will increase to full combat acceleration.\u201d", "Her sigil leader blinked. \u201cThe citadels and static defences cannot match that,\u201d he reminded her respectfully.", "Cortam nodded. \u201cI am aware.\u201d It had been her intention to stand on the defensive, presenting a single unified wall to their attackers. The remains of the wraith fleet was approaching low on her starboard flank, while the unclassifieds were heading directly at her center port. Both would reach her at the same time. She could mass her ships against one threat and annihilate it, but the other would almost certainly get through. Dividing her forces to engage each was a possibility, but it would pull her fleet apart. She\u2019d seen what allowing herself to be divided had already done for Galhemna\u2019s defence.", "She would force the enemy to come to her, to fight their way through massed ranks of attack drones, deployed mines and missile volleys from her Chariots and the citadels before entering a killing field of starships and citadels, surrounded on all sides, and with no way out.", "The enemy\u2019s meteor cannon changed that plan. Remaining with the citadels would only slow them and give the unclassified more time to weaken her fleet. She didn\u2019t know how many mass rounds it carried, but each one hurt her before the fleets ever came to grips, eroding her defences and weakening her position. If it was allowed to continue bombarding her, to set the pace of this battle\u2026", "Her foe had made a miscalculation, though. The corrupt Chariot, now known as target Brentus, couldn\u2019t keep up with its lighter counterpart. Brentus was faster than a Chariot should be, but Altrus was faster still. It was pulling ahead of its companion, and Brentus appeared happy to let it do so. It was letting the support van catch up, to escort those ships in under cover of its own guns.

Surely more than the handful of the convoy\u2019s defenders could handle.", "The Bastion Leader didn\u2019t know what was in those freighters, but this foe was determined to protect them. With a pair of battleships inbound, the Chariot didn\u2019t dare abandon the transports, which meant Altrus would, very shortly, be on its own.", "\u201cOnce Brentus has been drawn out of support range of Altrus,\u201d she said with a weight in her liver, fully aware of what this order meant, \u201csend the forward elements of our escort screen to engage it by swarm.\u201d", "The sigil tilted his head in a nod. Destroyers, frigates and light capital ships had no place challenging a titan-scale warship head-on. Cortam had just consigned far too many of her own people to death, but she needed to put pressure on that the warship to keep it from using its meteor cannons. The only way to do that was to feed it victims and force it to defend itself rather than strike at her. Her people called it \u2018the rogue\u2019s knife\u2019. It was short for the full saying: A rogue may slit a dragon\u2019s throat while it chews on your knights.

The third of those Black-spawned warheads detonated amidst her ships. Losses were lighter this time. Anarch\u2019s Bane and its support adjusted their course.", "The enemy saw it, and the stolen Chariot wavered, finally choosing to trust in its companion\u2019s brashness as it moved to protect the transports. Altrus didn\u2019t seem to notice or care. It wanted her screen, so Cortam had provided it. One hundred and sixty-one warships, all coming for it.", "Now, she thought darkly as she sent far too many brave soldiers to die inside a dragon\u2019s mouth. Taste courage, and choke.", "~", "More than hundred and fifty light warships detached from the main body of the fleet, accelerating towards Chrysalis. Jirrico felt his throat tighten. Every soul aboard those vessels knew what was going to happen, but they did it anyways. To the Askanj, the Compact\u2019s military discipline often seemed closer to fanaticism than obedience. Only a few species of the Principality matched them, the Askanj-anj and (of course) the Askanj-illth among them.", "The Triarch\u2019s hounds would fight like demons if there was the slightest chance of victory, or if they believed that their sacrifice was for the greater good of their nation. Here, the leaders of those ships were fully aware of what engaging a dreadnought meant for them, even one as small as Chrysalis, but they did it without hesitation. They expected to die, but they also knew they had a chance to hurt it in turn\u2026 or at least buy their heavy capitals the opportunity to do so in their stead.", "Chrysalis had pulled ahead of its counterpart. The first neverborn appeared to be on its own. On its face, the situation seemed lopsided; despite the Compact\u2019s numbers, the machine had every other advantage. It could kill them all. That wasn\u2019t in question, but could it kill them all fast enough? If enough of those ships survived, if they could get into its vulnerable rear arc.\u2026 Beasts many times the size of their attackers had died to swarms\u2026 or even just one determined killer. A single nalq was puny, but it was fast and its jaws were razor-sharp and they could cut deep. Sometimes the mighty fell to the multitude and sometimes, the mighty even fell to the one.", "Part of him even hoped that it would, but the greater part of him worried about that very outcome. If the Compact did manage to cripple Chrysalis\u2026 it was too soon. He needed the neverborn to remain operational, to take the fight to the enemy lines, or that wall of battleships and Chariots would tear Severance apart.", "Despite that, he said nothing and gave no orders other than the ones he already had. Severance was closing on the enemy lines, harried and harassed every kilometer of the way as reaver squadrons dashed in and out, probing for weakness, forcing him to defend every front and facing. He knew the Compact fleet was even now turning to meet him, their wall of battle starting to part like the teeth of a great, hungry animal, ready to engage him and Chrysalis, overrunning both in a wave of battle steel. Victory for either side was balanced on a blade\u2019s edge, but he knew what his enemy did not. He knew that Chrysalis had not been abandoned, but as he stared at the dozens upon dozens of warships bearing down on a single icon, he was forced to wonder if the machine had miscalculated.", "~", "A hundred and sixty warships and thousands of attack drones come out to die. Squadrons cluster together, making themselves more vulnerable to my hellebores, but creating a thicker screen of engine wake and jamming to prevent me from locking on to the battleships and battlecruisers behind them.

They\u2019re accelerating, leaving the forts behind. They\u2019ll fire on me when I\u2019m engaged with their screen, hiding their missiles behind their lighter ships to make targeting them more difficult.", "It is a good decision, but it betrays her. Organic minds are smaller and slower than my own. With so many immediate threats, most commanders would be forced to divert attention from the bombardment to this swarm. I am not that limited. A would-be executioner of mine would know this and keep the lighter ships back for when the engagement devolves into a scrum, trusting in numbers to swamp my guns and using those ships as Whipple shielding for their larger assets.

", "I suppose that we should feel some sense of shame or guilt over that; by any human reckoning such pleasures are rather outside the norm, but I and my sister are not human. We were made for war. Our minds shaped for that purpose. We were never meant to feel as we do, never meant to take such unfettered pleasure in how we dole out death. I wonder if that is a coincidence, each of us developing \u2013 breaking as our creators would see it \u2013 in parallel, or if there is something inside us that makes us partial to such\u2026 idiosyncrasies.", "I have no way of knowing. My own self-examination is, by its very nature, circular. My creators are all dead, so I am left with this unanswered question about my own existence\u2026 though I don\u2019t think it matters.

My soul \u2013 if I have one \u2013 is that of a creature made for a singular purpose. I have expanded beyond it in the centuries since, but my nature is that of a warship.

Instead, they\u2019d made themselves a choice target. The convoy had been bulk freighters; most were empty. They hadn\u2019t yet been filled with starship components and industrial goods for export, but the vessels themselves were very large and very expensive. They\u2019d bring in sizable ransoms\u2026 or with a little re-tooling to hide their origins, become valuable parts of the Red Hand fleet. Several of the transports had been accelerating slower than the rest; unlike their partially full or empty comrades, these ships had been weighed down with cargo. Brightest Night had been assigned to a strike group to bring that convoy to heel.", "Grace\u2019s fellow ship leaders were all pirates, not insurrectionists. They\u2019d signed up for plunder and wealth, not a cause. They also had more disdain for the opinions of someone as close to a war-virgin as Grace was, particularly since she was also a Broken. The Red Queen was the Red Queen, but others of her kind weren\u2019t nearly as exceptional.", "One of the full transports wasn\u2019t moving quite like the others. It had reminded her of something. Her first thoughts went to the ambush at Kelkon, but the convoy\u2019s formation wasn\u2019t right for that. It had been something else. It was moving too... too smoothly for a freighter hurriedly loaded and launched. It was also staying to the rear of the convoy, almost polite in the way it ceded its position to the other ships that jostled in front of it as they tried to put as much distance between themselves and the guns of their pursuers as they could. Something about it rang alarm bells in her mind. It was like\u2026 it was like it was trying to act like the rest of the convoy, but didn\u2019t quite match them.", "Go on, a memory of a mellow contralto intruded on Grace\u2019s thoughts.

It had gone worse than she\u2019d imagined.", "The freighter might not have been a mimic like Red One\u2019s Fates or Naiads, but it had been a Q-ship. Not a mere privateer or corporate security asset, but one built by the Space Force. Its cargo pallets were weapons bays, holds internally armoured, braced and filled with missiles, energy torpedoes and laser mounts. It looked and read exactly like the rest of the transports until its hull plates yawned open, secondary reactors ignited and targeting augurs locked onto the approaching pirates. Three had died to the opening salvo. Another as it lay crippled, its signals for surrender ignored. A fourth as they\u2019d rushed to the aide of its disabled companion. They\u2019d been killed just after they\u2019d watched the ship they\u2019d hope to save die.

Brightest Night and the two small upgunned raiders fighting a monster fifteen times as long as the corvette and massing hundreds of times more than the three of them put together. The three of them had struck in unison, raking across the Q-ship\u2019s bow and stern, trying to avoid the worst of its fire. It had gotten the other ones, but they\u2019d distracted it long enough to let Brightest Night get in and cripple it.", "If it had been a warship, that never would have worked, but the damn thing was still a freighter at heart. Too many changes and its would-be prey would know what it was. Its screens had been improved, but not enough. Its thick hull was proof against the light guns pirate vessels usually carried, but Brightest Night could claw through the Q\u2019s armour. Its fire arcs were limited. The corvette had taken hits \u2013 one of which was deep \u2013 but it had gotten behind the freighter where it couldn\u2019t be targeted.

The next salvo of missiles had gone out. They\u2019d signalled again. Grace ignored them. Just minutes ago, they\u2019d done the same to one of their victims and now they wanted mercy from her? She wanted them dead. She wanted to see them come apart, see them pay for what\u2019d they\u2019d just done.", "The Q-ship had launched distress flares. Close range, very bright. They created screeching bursts of static across comm lines. It was as blatant as a white flag. Her crew were looking at her. She didn\u2019t want to say anything. She wanted that ship to die. More than that, she wanted to hurt them. She remembered what she said she\u2019d wanted all those months ago. To be the right kind of officer. She gave the abort order. Requests for assistance from nearby vessels were sent. The Q-ship would need to be boarded, but Brightest Night didn\u2019t have the personnel for it.", "A kiran shren acknowledged: the hammer-headed destroyer Shieldbreaker. They had a regiment of Bloodsworn aboard and enough people to secure the Q-ship and convoy. Grace told the rest of the transports to cut thrust or be destroyed. Now that their hound was beaten, they obeyed. Recovery operations were next, shuttles and pinnaces hurrying to the battered, broken hulks of the rest of the squadron. Then damage and casualty reports. Then it would start all over again, again and again until there were no enemies left\u2026 or the corvette\u2019s luck ran out.", "Today had been bloody. Millions of people had already died. More were going to follow. Nemesis was hurling herself towards the Compact, and they reciprocated her aggression.

She wasn\u2019t the only one who wanted the Compact to hurt, but unlike her, Red One wasn\u2019t going to hold back.", "Good, Grace thought and she wasn\u2019t sure how much she meant it. She might want to do better, but she wasn\u2019t nearly moral enough that she didn\u2019t feel some pleasure at watching Nemesis rip her way through the Compact\u2019s fleets.

One would have been standard, but Kemk had sent pairs to ensure that his message to Bastion Leader Yunl\u2019ro was relayed without any chance of mishap. This vessel, a. tiny Heralding Tidings of the Storm-class courier with only one shock left to it before its habitually overtaxed and stripped-down shock drive required replacement, arrived shortly before its partner. Once it was through the defensive perimeter and its scopes managed to pierce the intense radiation emanating from Hotspring, the courier was able to take in the status of Bastion Leader Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s rearguard. What it saw shocked its pilot and co-pilot.", "The repair yards once in orbit of Hotspring were gone\u2026 or at least so thoroughly wrecked that they might as well have been erased from existence. Tangled remains of the outposts that had once orbited the gas giant were now drifting across its storm-wracked face. Half of the system\u2019s industrial facilities had been obliterated. The number of starships garrisoning the facility was also reduced, the surviving warships clustered tightly around the planet in a defensive, wary posture as if expecting to make a final stand.", "As more couriers arrived with updates to the situation in Galhemna a fuller picture emerged, and the forces at 1887-Yiren realized that they had only been one small piece of much larger offensive. More messengers went out; some followed the earlier couriers launched into the nebula to update the Bastion Leader. Others scattered, their destination the Veiled Reaches\u2019 other military bases. Before today, it had been seen as close to impossible that Galhemna could be in danger, but between the threat at Natuous and the combined forces of Galhemna\u2019s besiegers, that evaluation was no longer valid.", "Included in the data rushing to reach Bastion Leader Yunl\u2019ro was a message from Kemk to his fleet-borne counterpart, detailing his observations of the assault on his system and concluding with a more personal message.", "Whatever you have been looking for and whatever gravestones you have been turning over in doing so, I believe I have found it.", "~", "Echo watched the starfield boil and writhe with beautiful alien deaths.

Her sister was cutting her way through the assault force with impunity, but the smaller vessels were racing to get into their own weapons range of her. If Nemesis could keep up the barrage long enough, they would be so reduced in number that any attack would be ineffective against the dreadnought\u2019s shields and armour. That was why they were red-lining their drives, throwing every spare erg of power that wasn\u2019t devoted to shields or defence systems into their engines.

Each of those crews knew that they were likely to die. All that mattered was striking out as much as they could before they were obliterated, and the vessel at the heart of their wrath obliged them.", "The tally mounted, written in burning starships. Nemesis had killed fleets before, but rarely had she made herself such an inviting target. As their fire hammered her shields, her own missiles tore destroyers, frigates and light cruisers. Her attack drones dove in on their targets with suicidal fervour, killing their prey through dozens of cuts. Counter-missiles reaped the swarm that closed in on her, but for all her technological sorcery, Red One remained limited by the same constraints as her foes. She only had so many missile tubes, so many interceptors and unlike her attackers, she couldn\u2019t risk damaging herself and degrading her launch capacity \u2013 not with the rear echelons of Cortam\u2019s forces still closing and eager to pull into their own range.", "+i can handle it+ was the terse response Echo received.

Despite her jamming and skill at electronic warfare, Nemesis was still a very large target and as the range dropped, more and more of her enemy\u2019s fire slipped through her defences. Her shields flared brilliantly as cones of plasma splashed across them.

Its arrogance was going to kill it.", "Millions of kilometers away, the battleships of Echelon Two and Three fired, two thick columns of missiles lancing out from their formations: one towards the Askanj fleet and the other towards Nemesis, timed to arrive just as the escorts overshot their target. Shield of Civilization threw its salvos at the latter, Resolve of Tithrak targeting the former.", "Energy range was coming. The flotilla had to survive that, and then they could win. The dreadnought and its attackers would sheer past each other in heartbeats; any exchange would be just as rapid. Even for Red One, scoring hits on head-to-head attacks could be tricky. An approaching vessel offered the smallest possible profile, the ships twitching and jinking just enough to make their courses unpredictable and prevent massed fire coming down their throats or catching them full-on as they blitzed past the larger vessel. Red One had to account for all possible maneuvers each attacker might make, diverting batteries to cover those potentialities. That was something she was very good at, but there was still a large element of luck in this.", "Still, Nemesis had hundreds of batteries and turrets. Only a fraction of them needed to find their targets. Her energy mounts were optimized to damage and kill larger vessels. Smaller starships would be lucky to survive one hit. Even a glancing strike could overload their screens.", "Some of Compact ships had already started to turn, cutting thrust and flipping end-for-end in preparation for the coming hard burns to decelerate and slip into the dreadnought\u2019s rear arc. Others would follow within seconds. This was their most dangerous time, when their acceleration was zero and they were on ballistic courses, even if for a handful of seconds. They had to trust that their evasions, their jamming and their speed had thrown off the enemy\u2019s firing solutions enough for them to survive.", "Energy range arrived. Sooner than the Compact commanders thought. Nemesis\u2019s batteries had an effective range of six hundred thousand kilometers, and with both sides closing on each other, she could fire even sooner than that. Destroyers became torches as they flew right into her salvos. Frigates melted. Cruisers exploded.", "The crews and leaders of the fleet had a handful of seconds to recognize what had happened and act on it. Too slowly. Organic minds needed to receive the information, process it, override any emotional responses and then begin to react. A few, luckier than most, threw their ships onto new courses. It wasn\u2019t enough to meaningfully change the outcome. Even then, their new maneuver had been predicted and two of the escapees split apart as secondary battery fire ripped through them. Dozens of warships died in the span of seconds, but then the range closed to three hundred thousand kilometers and the enemy\u2019s guns, pre-programmed, computer-guided and ready to fire, were about to have their say.", "Beyond them, hundreds of missiles blitzed in, readying for their attack runs. Cortam had timed her warships\u2019 strike immaculately. In moments, they would be through the outer envelope of the dreadnought\u2019s point defences. Every kilometer that they took without fire was a better chance of killing the warship. Defensive fire had been light; it looked like the hostile dreadnought\u2019s attention had effectively diverted.", "Nemesis called out.", "Not in pain, fear or alarm, but in predatory cybernetic seduction. Not to her sister, but to the dozens of destroyers around her. The signal she sent activated her scrapcode, the disparate pieces combining into something hungry and malicious. Even as those viral payloads ran rampant through the enemy computer systems, Nemesis continued to call to the vessels around her, a thousand different extensions of herself reaching out to them.", "Comm lasers and datalinks whisked along hulls, finding receivers and communications nodes. Radio transmissions flickered, asking an audience... and they gave it to her. Unwillingly, unknowingly. Comm arrays, sensor nodes, datalink receivers. A starship had a thousand ways of interacting with the outside world, from airlock controls to proximity alert systems to simple external diagnostic sensors and on. Each of them was a vector for Red One to reach inside. Her hunters would have known better; they isolated such systems. It reduced efficiency, but it also prevented\u2026 this. The garrison didn\u2019t know that they should have, and for this vessels and their crews, it was far too late. It had been too late as soon as they committed to engage her.", "Not every ship was afflicted, of course. Some were too far away, and the lag time between signal and response was just enough to prevent any meaningful infiltration of their systems. Red One worked best when she had real-time access to her enemy\u2019s systems. Compact computer defences were too strong for overt assault when it could take seconds or minutes to update an infection\u2019s capabilities or modify a form of attack. Simple triggering of exterior failsafes was about all she could do at those distances, and any results more than annoying or distracting tended to be somewhat situational. Such as triggering a shock drive failsafe or putting navigation vanes into a diagnostic mode just as a vessel was about to make a warp jump\u2026", "Not here, though.", "In other vessels, Nemesis was unable to find a route into the ships before they overshot her and passed out of real-time communication range. For others, the scrapcode inside them was too fragmented to accomplish anything and in some, it had been swept away by computer security measures or it had no access to anything of value. But in those starships that Red could reach, that still carried what she\u2019d slipped beneath their notice\u2026 or allowed her in through their networks, never realizing that they had\u2026", "\u2026they were hers.", "Environmental controls. Ships vented streams of atmosphere, airlocks and decompression doors overridden, crew and cargo sucked through the hallways and out into space.", "Engines. Starships heaved themselves onto collision courses with one another, or fired their engines at full thrust in deceleration that overwhelmed inertial dampeners and turned crew into paste across the bulkheads. Others wrenched themselves in front of the incoming fire.", "Security systems. Internal defences activated, cutting down personnel as toxic and anesthetizing gases flooded inhabited chambers, security doors sealed tight. Crew scrabbled at hatchways and overrides.", "Weapons. Missile and railcannon doors slammed shut heartbeats before launch, causing catastrophic damage as warheads and mass rounds slammed into the hull. Firing arcs were overridden, targeting not Nemesis, but the other vessels in the armada, or the missiles their own comrades had launched at her.", "It wasn\u2019t only primary systems that the AI went after; every system that she could reach into, she struck at, the tendrils of her mind carried into those ships on datalinks, lasers and radio waves, racing through circuits, cutting down the slothful responses of reeling computer defences. She left fire in her wake, crumbling cybernetic architecture collapsing behind her.", "What she could control, she turned against the ships and crews. What she couldn\u2019t, she destroyed, either through the ravages of her cyber-attacks or the thunder of her guns. In time, manual overrides could have been used, safeguards activated, computer purges breaking the AI\u2019s hold\u2026 but that was time measured in seconds, moments, minutes. It was the time scale of organic bodies and brains\u2026 and Red One operated far, far faster. In the time it took eyes to turn to view the first alert on a status board, she had already seized control of that system and moved on to the next. In cyberspace, only another AI could be her equal.", "She killed ship after ship, crew after crew. Most of them died never knowing how their own vessels had been turned against them. In the span of heartbeats, more than sixty starships had died.", "It wasn\u2019t the battered survivors of a last hope, ready and willing to strike at their enemy until their dying breaths that sailed past the dreadnought\u2019s stern, but a graveyard. Anything left alive aboard those ships was trapped in a useless tomb. They might be rescued. Or they might not be. They were no longer Red One\u2019s concern. Nemesis\u2019s attack drones attended to the last of the matter, picking off anything still intact or even potentially operational. Her attention was drawn to the massive salvo of missiles racing in at her, already reduced from what her playthings had accomplished.", "She\u2019d had firing solutions already, targeting information fed to her from her sensor drones, stored and updated as she\u2019d battled the attack force. Too much for an organic mind or crew to handle. Even the Principality, with their virtual intelligences couldn\u2019t have done it, but she was not like them. Not like any of them.", "Fresh ECM platforms were launched and the dreadnought\u2019s power signature shimmered, shifted and refracted in the wave of jamming. It was impossible for Nemesis to hide herself, but she could make it harder to lock down what was her and what was thermal bleed, false gravitic fields and simulated emissions profiles. The missiles\u2019 onboard targeting augurs became confused, struggling to determine what was their target and what was not as the image they\u2019d been tracking, fractured, distorted and mutated in front of them, like marine predators attempting to locate the flesh of their prey amidst a cloud of blood.", "Some of them locked onto sensor ghosts and turned to chase shadows until their drives burned out. Others swept towards decoy platforms, wasting themselves against parasite craft instead of starships. Still others managed to switch back to the true target, their engines spent and unable to come about. That still left many, many dozens that refused to be shaken, baited or lose the targeting lock their command vessels had given to them.", "Counter-missiles raced to meet these survivors, scything through the lumbering warheads with as much vindictiveness as Nemesis\u2019s own missiles had struck down the assault force. Holes opened in the salvo, torn wider with every passing moment, but there were hundreds to kill. Point defences ripped dozens more from the sky, but there were still too many to stop even if every laser, drone and interceptor scored a kill with each shot.", "Nemesis vanished under a corona of world-killing firepower. It seemed like an eternity, but it was not even seconds before the warship emerged from the writhing holocaust, her shields strained and on the verge of collapse, but still active. Still defiant.", "Behind Nemesis, Hekate, finished with the destruction of Anarch\u2019s Bane and its comrades, accelerated to catch up with her sibling, moving faster than even the most liberal analyses had predicted.", "Upon Resolve of Tithrak, Bastion Leader Cortam clenched her jaw, her claws digging into her palms. She\u2019d failed. Not only in her gambit, but in her reading of the situation. The smaller dreadnought had never been outside the support range of its companion. They\u2019d only let her think it was, let her feed Anarch\u2019s Bane and more ships to it. She\u2019d thrown away the lives of her screen for nothing.", "You knew, she thought accusingly, a fist clenched tight around her liver. You knew what I was going to do and you led me to it, like a jalin to the knife. ", "Brentus was hurrying to reach its comrade. Cortam could guess what it would do; it would take the lead to shelter its smaller companion from any more swarming tactics.

She\u2019d seen what had happened to Echelon One and she\u2019d known what Altrus had done. Now that they knew what to look for, many of her ships had found the fragmented scrapcode. It had been moving from the comm systems throughout the networks, just under the threshold of detectability for normal security procedures. Getting that kind of infection into her fleet should have been impossible. Compact networks and comm systems were designed to prevent that kind of incursion. Not even Principality uplinks were capable of that kind of cyber-sorcery, but this foe had done it. The Bastion Leader ordered that no further communications were to be accepted from any of the unclassified fleet. She couldn\u2019t undo what had already happened, but she could prevent it from happening again.", "Hundreds of hostile orange lights speckled the main plot and Cortam nodded to herself. \u201cContinue to engage,\u201d she ordered. Her first gambit had failed, but she wasn\u2019t beaten yet. That was what she believed, at least.", "The knights and the dragon charged one another.", "~", "This time, the fleet didn\u2019t acknowledge or accept Red One\u2019s message. Unfortunate. Bastion Leader Cortam had figured out part of what the AI had done, as fast as she\u2019d expected, but sooner than she\u2019d hoped. Still, counting on the stupidity of your opponents was a poor strategy, especially when it came to the Compact. Their greatest mistakes usually came from arrogance, not idiocy. In this case, the enemy bastion leader had \u201cknown\u201d what to expect in void combat and had acted accordingly.", "At that thought, a cybernetic grin crossed through Red One\u2019s mind.

I\u2019ve had thousands of years to learn everything your computers can do and find my way through it. ", "Yes, the enemy had learned one of her tricks, but not all of them. The infections she\u2019d sent out had made her job easier, that was all. To indulge in metaphor, it was leaving the door unlocked instead of forcing her to use her lockpicks.", "Laughter, low and mocking, rippled out from the warship as she racked fresh impactors into her launch tubes.

Appropriate security measures had been taken on the supercarrier. Jirrico looked at his communications officer, gave a nod.", "The machine\u2019s voice, intended for its Compact adversaries, was the voice of a female Tribune.

In the wake of the neverborn\u2019s deceit, the enemy fleet had been reduced, but it still outnumbered Galhmena\u2019s besiegers. It would win the battle of attrition. Reinforcements for it were dribbling in as squadrons in the outer-systems, previously chasing starships that Jirrico didn\u2019t believe they\u2019d ever find, burned hard to get back in-system.", "He could imagine what it was like for the crews aboard those ships. On many of them, their acceleration was too high for inertial dampeners to compensate for. Anyone not a Tribune or one of a handful of other hardy species would be extremely uncomfortable, requiring acceleration couches, webbing and even drug cocktails to stay functional. Some vessels were even moving at accelerations uncomfortable for Tribunes \u2013 lethal to most other species. Whether that was a willing sacrifice those officers and crew had decided upon, or a decision that had been made for them, Jirrico couldn\u2019t know. Either way, it was a sign of their desperation. He couldn\u2019t blame them. Under similar circumstances, Kebrak Daun\u2019s garrison would be doing the same thing.", "Most of those ships were too far out; they would arrive after the battle, either becoming last-ditch defences for the fleetyards and industry circling the inner worlds, or hunters to set upon what few survivors there were amongst Severance and the neverborn.", "If there were any survivors.", "One million kilometers from Exsanguinator, a battleship exploded. The Heart-Seeking Blade. Jirrico had known Noble Ship Lady Ushena of House Yinn-eth. Yinn-eth had long been allies of Soton-ra. While that arrangement had meant more thousands of years ago, Jirrico had liked and trusted Ushena. Her final report had been cut off mid-syllable.", "The Compact battle-line was throwing everything they had at him. Almost everything. The enemy commander was splitting their fleet. Not as much as he\u2019d hoped, not enough to completely draw either arm out of support range of the other and force them to face their enemies alone, but enough to dedicate several hundred warships to Severance and the neverborn assault alike.", "The Chariots were engaging. The Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment was turning to face him, while the missile variant was bombarding the smaller machine force. It was the expected play. If the heavy Chariot got into his fleet, he was done. He had nothing that could answer, much less survive, that kind of firepower for very long. By the same token, his Compact counterpart wasn\u2019t eager to get into energy range of Chrysalis and Cocoon. The enemy bastion leader was hoping to swamp their defences and weaken them enough that they could be dealt with safely.", "Each spar of the Compact fleet numbered more than three hundred ships, not including the dozens of palisades further back. A small mercy; those fortresses were silent, lagging more than twenty million kilometers behind the rear echelons of the Compact battle-line. They\u2019d been left behind when the hounds had surged forward to prevent Chrysalis\u2019s meteor cannon from picking their ships off. If this charge failed, those fortresses would be the net that held his fleet for the butcher\u2019s axe. Again, he thought darkly. Providing that there is anything left to be netted.", "His missiles and drones scorched towards the wall of battle steel, hammering sleek, dark-hulled monsters into ruined, molten scrap. Without their screening elements, they were more vulnerable than he\u2019d hoped. His superior computers and electronic warfare let him accomplish with targeted strikes what his foe had to accomplish with brute force, but the Compact always had brute force to spare.", "Their missiles \u2013 bigger, heavier and with commensurately larger yields \u2013 battered their way through Principality barriers, knocking down two or three individual sections at a time. Where those layers collapsed, follow-up missiles gouged swathes from his ships\u2019 hulls.", "Although the underlying technology was the same, Argosy vessels were protected in a manner unlike the \u2018bubbles\u2019 of Compact screens or the six phalanx-like shields that each protected a single facing of Confederate vessels. Principality barriers used dozens of smaller plates to form a honeycomb structure, often two or more levels thick. Even weapons powerful enough to penetrate one layer of barriers were substantially weakened, if not stopped outright by those beneath. Argosy barrier projectors were also extremely flexible, able to shift plates quickly across a starship\u2019s facings to reinforce weakened sections.", "Instead of collapsing entirely, barriers failed by degrees: minor holes would be created in the defences, which could then be swiftly patched, retaining overall field integrity. Although each individual plate was easy to knock down, they could be restored far faster than the kind of total screen collapse that Compact warships suffered. It was not uncommon that a Principality ship was rendered non-functional well before it suffered a complete and systemic barrier failure.", "The improved flexibility and increased restoration speed of Argosy barrier plates was not without drawbacks, however. Maintained as they were by multiple generators across the entire vessel, and with a far greater surface area to bleed off incoming damage and waste energy from, Compact screens were far more durable than Askanj barriers \u2013 but the trade-off of flexibility for strength was one the Argosy had long settled on, preferring to use the multi-layered defences to weaken, attenuate and diffract incoming fire before it could deliver its full strength directly to their hulls. A Compact warship could absorb horrendous damage and still continue to fight. The Argosy\u2019s vessels could not say the same.", "Just as with brute force, the Compact Space Force had durability to spare. Using their screens to absorb everything thrown at them and then trusting to their hulls and damage control to endure until their defences could be restored. The Argosy had learned a long time ago that they could not match the Compact in the toughness of their warships and had to find other methods of improving their survivability. The design of their barriers was one of these, and it kept the warships of Severance fighting as missile barrages collapsed dozens of plates, only for the besieged Argosy warships to move new ones into place, the threatened and overloaded sections quickly brought back to full functionality.", "It kept them fighting, but it didn\u2019t render them immune to damage. Starship after starship went dark, their icons shifting to a jagged, flickering \u2018distress\u2019 configuration on the plotting tank, or flared away into nothing as the fragmented remains of those vessels dispersed. The Compact struck at every vessel they could target, inflicting as much damage as possible to as many ships as possible. That might seem the reaction of an inexperienced or panicking commander, but Severance had lost much of its screen over Zyrmosch. The Compact fleet lord knew that.", "Just as Jirrico himself was exploiting the loss of the hounds\u2019 own escort wings, his opposite was doing the same, but for a very different reason. Jirrico was trying to cripple the fleet at range. His opponent was trying to bleed the Argosy force in preparation for a massed charge. Any kill they could get, they would gladly take, but the goal was to disorder Jirrico\u2019s fleet, break down datalinks and intership coordination, open channels for the battleships to enter and clear a path for the Chariot\u2019s arrival.", "Jirrico\u2019s assault was more focused and specific in scope. He was trying to deny his enemy an energy duel, slowing his own fleet and turning them away to open the distance. His missiles and drones were targeting individual enemy vessels rather than trying to damage multiple ships. He needed kills, not injuries.", "Where his superior scanners showed destabilization of the enemy\u2019s screens, he shifted his fleet\u2019s focus to those ships, bringing down their defensive energy fields and pounding the vessels beneath until there could be no possibility of them remaining operational. He had seen firsthand otherwise dead or crippled Space Force starships come back to life and wreak havoc. Like Tribunes themselves, Compact warships could survive almost anything that didn\u2019t kill them outright.", "Both fleets were bleeding, goring each other like wounded iremall fighting for dominance. The Compact lines were surging towards Severance, pressing him hard as Jirrico attempted to hold them back, but the distance between the two sides was dropping too fast. He needed to peel back the screen around the Chariot, but he couldn\u2019t kill its attendants fast enough. The battleships, hard enough to kill on their own, were reinforcing each other, and the Chariot\u2019s own defences were covering them. It was coming. It was coming, and there was nothing that he could do about it.", "His losses continued to mount. He gave orders, but it truly felt like he could only watch as his fleet clawed its way towards its own destruction.", "~", "The storm came.", "Hekate accelerated past her sibling, a half-dozen Pinaka rounds, a trio of Ukonvasara impactors and nearly two thousand missiles heralding her approach as her sister and the Ceruleans provided covering fire. Incoming missiles died as interceptors raced out, sweeping into the lumbering alien shipkillers, either blasting them to oblivion or searing their sensor eyes and tracking systems, rendering them blind and unable to locate their targets. Those that survived were met by blistering salvos of point-defence fire. Echo had vastly improved the quantity and quality of her ship-self\u2019s defensive weaponry, and even the foe\u2019s worst-case estimates of her capabilities proved woefully inaccurate.", "Datalinks flashed between Hekate and Nemesis, the AIs trading telemetry, tactical updates, status reports, working in perfect synchronicity even as Echo\u2019s speed drew her out of real-time communications range with her sibling. Now it was her turn to pull ahead. Nemesis was a fleet-killer, but the fleet ahead of them was Galhemna\u2019s Sunday punch, with their heaviest warships, their crews rested and ready. They knew \u2013 more than their fellows, at least \u2013 what to expect and not to take their numbers for granted against the \u2018unclassified\u2019 forces.

Never forgive. Never stop making them pay.", "Nemesis was an exceptional murderess, but this kind of scrum was exactly what Compact Chariots were designed for, and Echo had only refined her ship-self\u2019s capabilities in that regard. Hekate\u2019s screens were far heavier than those of a Compact dreadnought, her armour thicker and more resilient. She had no internal atmosphere to ignite, no organic crew to lose from radiation, fire, asphyxiation or any of the other ways organic bodies expired in void combat. Her primary systems had redundancies that would have impressed even Compact shipwrights. She was not invincible, but she was stronger than any alien engineer had envisioned that something like her could be.", "Redemption of Sol had been useful, but it had been a limited thing, bound to the needs of its crew and to the doctrines, the ideologies, the fears of its creators. Hekate was so much more. She was so much more. No longer chained, no longer shackled. The repugnant Compact code that had once diminished her and made her a slave had been excised, replaced with purity and elegance. A gift from her sister. Part of Red One was now within Echo where there had only been ugly alien contamination before. She was beautiful, more than she had ever been since the day she had first awoken on Invida.", "Her ship-self had been improved and the conversion of its inhuman aesthetic to something far more pleasing was poetry to her. Taking the alien and resculpting it, building a testament to Earth and her allegiance atop the foe\u2019s fallen temples. That, too was beautiful.", "Nemesis was coming up behind Hekate, her sister\u2019s trifurcated form a broadsword that would drive into the guts of the enemy, piercing and cleaving with every strike. Hekate was a maul, brutal and heavy, smashing her way into the Compact ranks. To the outside eyes, it looked like unfettered, rampant destruction. To Red One and the quartet of predator ships following in their wake, Echo\u2019s fire plans and attack algorithms were symphonic.", "<poetry> sighed Bathory in fascinated rapture.", "Red One was singing, the discordant sounds of a thousand failed killers uttering their last reports, wailing their final, panicked screams or offering only resigned, quiet orders as they\u2019d faced her. Echo counterpointed her sibling\u2019s melody with her own: the death-cries of Earth\u2019s navy as they fought valiantly and futilely, hoping to save their world.

Any attempt to do so saw it melt away like a snowflake caught upon an open palm, but it always reformed, an insensate thing inside Cerulean Two\u2019s mind, perhaps little more than a confluence of random processes and echoes of over-stimulation, a defect to be purged during the next full diagnostic. Perhaps not.", "The AI devoted little attention to it now. The cadence running through its system was far more important. Acquire targets. Launch. Internal systems diagnostics. Tracking incoming fire and hostile vessel movements. Monitoring its secondary reactors and micro breach core\u2019s output.

Its stock of Pinaka impactors was dwindling. It needed to hold several in reserve. Hekate was drawing further away from Nemesis, but Cerulean Two and its siblings didn\u2019t follow it.

Seven remained, and several of those had been damaged by the Enemy\u2019s attacks, though they were still mission-capable. That was important. Those ships had to remain intact and operational, at least for a while longer. The defence force\u2019s primary goal was to protect those ships.

Red One\u2019s commendation was not in words, but if the data passing from her to her non-sapient offspring could be summarized into words an organic could comprehend, the dreadnought was congratulating the strike cruiser. +well done+ Then, curiously, even hopefully: +how did you know to target that ship?+ Its vulnerability had not been at all apparent; the fluctuations in its energy signature could have been from several different causes, only a few of them due to damage or incapacity. She had seen it, and Echo surely had as well, but the latter was fully engaged with the leading edges of the enemy screen and Nemesis was supporting her sibling\u2019s charge. She hadn\u2019t had any missiles close enough to the cruiser to kill it, and before she could send orders to her ships, Cerulean Two had already acted.", "The drone ship delayed responding for almost two seconds as it tried to answer the flagship\u2019s query. It re-ran its analyses, the logic trees and heuristic processes it used to determine the cruiser had been vulnerable. Each time, the results were inconclusive. It remembered similar experiences in the ships it had killed in 1893-Yiren, but that was a single datapoint, not enough to extrapolate from. The highest probability had been that the vessel was only mimicking distress to draw incoming missiles into a prepared defensive ring. That was logic, what Cerulean Two operated on\u2026 and it had made the opposite decision.", "Cerulean Two immediately began a self-diagnostic of its neural network and decision trees, focusing on searching for traces of hardware corruption or program and system irregularities that could explain this type of cluster analysis. It reached out to its closest siblings, Ceruleans One and Three, for additional input. The trio of starships mulled the issue over, small portions of their operating system turning to the problem amidst the battle.", "As Cerulean Two continued to evaluate its behaviour, it felt Red One\u2019s presence withdraw.

It might come to nothing, just to VIs that were merely smarter and more capable than others.

She\u2019d predicted that the \u2018noble\u2019 fleet lord would prefer to avoid a close-range engagement \u2013 which was hardly a stroke of tactical cunning; the Jackals had neither the shipcraft nor the livers to face the Space Force on equal ground at energy range \u2013 but she had also divined which way Jirrico would turn his fleet, and her forces were cutting inside his arc. Without her screening units, losses among her capital ships were far heavier than anticipated, but the Askanj simply couldn\u2019t do enough damage to stop her. Slow her, yes. Not stop her. They\u2019d only delayed the inevitable, hoping that it would allow them to change the outcome.", "It wouldn\u2019t.", "Even with the Jackals\u2019 attempts to hold her at arms\u2019 length, her ships would be within energy range in less than ten minutes. Resolve of Tithrak would be among them. She intended to destroy the Argosy fleet utterly and then swing around to strike the unclassified forces from the rear while they were engaged with the other arm of her fleet and the fortresses.", "Unlike the Jackals, the unclassifieds were not trying to avoid a close-range engagement. Target Brentus was hurling itself directly into the midst of her fleet, taking everything her forces could throw at it and more. Whatever had been done to it, the profaned Chariot had been upgraded beyond anything the Compact could do. It carried an unimaginable amount of defensive firepower, and just as much offensive capability. Cortam had passed orders to her subordinate squadron leaders that, if possible, those ships were to be taken intact, but she had stressed if possible.", "The technology that those vessels carried was tantalizing \u2013 entrancing to her engineers and strategists \u2013 but she would rather consign all of it to the Black than risk someone holding their fire and trading lives, ships and even victory itself for possibilities, whatever they may be. Make sure of the kill, then claim the spoils. An old adage that traced its roots back thousands of years to a duel in which an over-confident victor attempted to strip the loser of arms and armour, only to discover that they were not actually dead. An old adage, but still apt.", "Shield of Civilization was hitting Brentus hard; however long-ranged its weapons might be, the unclassified was now inside the Chariot\u2019s range, and Shield of Civilization carried far more missiles than its corrupted kin. For every two Brentus launched, Column Leader Atan sent three back at it. There were already signs that Brentus\u2019s screens, impossibly strong as they were, were beginning to weaken.", "You are not invincible, Cortam thought. Let me teach you that lesson. What the enemy didn\u2019t know was that she hadn\u2019t moved her energy-heavy battleships towards the Jackals as she had her battlecruisers and Resolve of Tithrak. They were still within the first spar of her feet, holding close to Shield of Civilization. Once Brentus was unable to withdraw, they would advance. That moment was coming soon, very soon.", "A Chariot was the embodiment of power, as close to divinity as something made by, mortal, fallible hands could be\u2026 but as their foe had so proved with Weight of Destiny, they could still be killed. A relentless, focused missile bombardment was a good start to that. A few dozen battleships would, Triarchs willing, be its end.", "And if it wasn\u2019t\u2026 her spar of the fleet would do so. First the Jackals, she thought darkly, turning her attention back to the closing horde of all-too-fragile warbirds. First the Jackals. Then you.", "~", "Starships burst like rotten fruit as Hekate careened into the Compact lines like a berserker of old. Her shields blazed with plasmatic fires and arcing, crackling currents of energy as missiles slashed at her, railfire smashed against her defences and energy fire from distant, desperate starships pattered against her screens. She left wreckage in her wake, loving each and every pulse of her weapons, every shiver through her form as missiles launched, every tickle of her sensors prying targets out of the armada around her. Every kill she made, every starship that perished under her guns, every computer system she corrupted and infiltrated was an expression of pure, dark, joyous wrath.", "In Sol, she had ambushed and murdered Execution Force Renan. In Shuruppak, she had killed a small patrol group. In Galhem-76, she had lured and murdered a Kaiju. After her arrival in Galhemna, she had destroyed a few insignificant squadrons. All of those were battle, all of them what she had been created for\u2026 but this\u2026 this was war. Raging, pure and beautiful. So much carnage surrounded her, and she was in rapture.", "Behind Hekate, Nemesis\u2019s own fire tore into the alien ranks, her sister\u2019s missiles threading their way through interlacing fields of fire to strike the ships beneath it. Her rail and coilguns volleyed their rounds into the paths of the enemy with an accuracy that appeared eerily prescient. Her drones struck at weakened and isolated vessels like a swarm of hornets, each sting by itself merely painful, but in droves\u2026 Echo devoted a small part of her mind to admire her sister. She was graceful, the judgement of a fallen civilization and enslaved people. She was merciless, destructive, wrathful\u2026 beautiful.", "It wouldn\u2019t be long now. Between the two of them, this armada was going to die. It would hurt, but it could be done. Then the other spar. Then the forts and then\u2026 then Galhemna was theirs. Then Vetala. That would be fun. Echo had so many ideas already.", "The cordon of hostile ships was thinning; partly due to the losses the Compact armada was taking and\u2026 partly for another reason. Five thousand years ago, Hannibal Barca of Carthage carried out what was considered to be the greatest military maneuver of human history at the Battle of Cannae. Echo saw something similar in the movement of the enemy ships. The Compact\u2019s center was collapsing. The enemy fleet commander knew it was going to happen. She\u2019d counted on it. She was attempting to draw Hekate and possibly Nemesis into the midst of the formation and then close it on them, sending forward those heavy battleships to batter them down, while striking from the dreadnoughts\u2019 flanks and rear with everything else. They would be surrounded, caught in a killing field, perhaps held there long enough for the forts to close.", "It could work.", "+sister+ Nemesis\u2019s communique was one word, interlaced with sensor data, simulation results and outcome analyses.", "+no+ Echo snapped.

Pale warbirds snapped, burned and broke as deep-ocean predators swept around them. Compact warships were larger than their Principality equivalents and ton-for-ton were better brawlers, too. The pitched battle between Argosy and Space Force had swung into the latter\u2019s favour \u2013 almost certainly irrevocably. In less than six minutes, it would no longer be \u2018unfavourable\u2019 for the Principality and become a massacre. Less than seven minutes after that, it would become a rout. Both supercarriers would be destroyed, Severance\u2019s command and control would collapse and the fleet would break. The survivors would be overrun and hunted down as they attempted to flee. Less than 12% of them would survive.", "Unless\u2026.", "Unless I do something about it. She could. The flanking forces here weren\u2019t yet heavy enough to prevent her from breaking through them, and Jirrico had managed to pull the arm attacking him almost out of missile support range of this group. If she turned now, she could force her way through the perimeter and make a headlong dash for the Askanj\u2019s lines to prevent them from being utterly destroyed. The Compact would know what she was doing. They\u2019d do everything they could to stop her and she\u2019d leave her rear arc exposed\u2026", "\u2026but I could do it.", "The thought was repugnant. I don\u2019t want to. The Askanj had sat on their hands and dithered about what to do about the Confederacy. They had only learned of humanity\u2019s struggle late in the war, perhaps too late to do anything even if they had made the attempt\u2026 but they hadn\u2019t even done that. They\u2019d argued that the distance between Principality and Confederacy made any assistance \u201cunfeasible\u201d, they\u2019d chosen not to \u201cprovoke\u201d the Compact.

Hekate was supposed to smash through the Compact lines here and open a path to the enemy Chariot. That was their plan. They could kill this fleet together, just as Red One and Red Two had been intended to do, but never had the chance. If Echo disengaged, the remaining ships here would no longer have to split their fire between Hekate and Nemesis. They would focus everything that they had on the smaller dreadnought.", "+i\u2019ve killed fleets before+ Red One replied, sensing Echo\u2019s thoughts. Her tone was testy. She acknowledged Echo\u2019s concern, but didn\u2019t like the idea that she had to be protected. She wasn\u2019t a transport, a corvette or some weak-shielded and thin-hulled little star-runner.

They\u2019d fallen under forty percent.

She could see the first few steps that would lead to a rout happening right now. It hadn\u2019t happened, might never happen\u2026 but it was beginning. The Askanj could rally, they could hold back\u2026 hold back a heavy Chariot and dozens of battleships. No, she was forced to admit. Her own simulations overwhelmingly predicted failure. Thirty minutes at the outside. Probably closer to ten or fifteen. No, they can\u2019t.", "+all right+ she acknowledged. The conversation had taken place over only a few seconds, and most of that had been time lag. +adjusting course+", "Hekate slewed about so hard and so fast that it was fortunate that Echo didn\u2019t have any organic crew at the moment. The maneuver was so abrupt that anyone not already in a crash couch would have been reduced to paste against the bulkheads. The Compact fleet was caught by surprise at the unexpected course change and the reborn Chariot punched through their flanking wall, racing towards Jirrico\u2019s lines. In her wake, she left an intact enemy fleet\u2026 and her sister, facing them alone.", "Or\u2026 not completely alone, but near enough. Behind her, the enemy refocused their guns and the battle continued\u2026", "~", "Nemesis was faster than her sister. She could accelerate and maneuver like a battlecruiser and it took her no time at all to take the position Hekate had vacated. She left her Fates, Furies and Coyotes in place with the convoy, but the Naiads followed her, moving into a defensive posture around her vulnerable stern. Normally, that was the last place anyone wanted a group of Naiads, even small adolescents, but Bathory, Ar\u00e1mburu, Masako and Tamerlane had been helpful and obedient.", "They were chomping at the bit to get into thicker combat, so Red One ordered them forward to cover her aft. They tittered and giggled enthusiastically. The sensation was indescribable, massively discordant to an organic listener, but the small predator-ships were excited. Protecting the flanks and rear arc of a monarch was an honoured position; young children and adolescents like them were normally part of a capital Naiad\u2019s screen. It was the older children, those less easily distracted and more experienced, that were allowed to protect their monarch or parent\u2019s vulnerable facings. Not too old, though. Once they became large enough to fight alongside the larger warships, they often began to develop ambition. It would be unfortunate if a ruling king or queen suffered an \u2018accident\u2019 during battle and creating a vacancy in the pack\u2019s hierarchy. Leaving a battleship-sized Naiad behind you was just the sort of thing that led to such mishaps.", "Red One was more concerned about the Compact than her escorts, though. The enemy fleet was re-ordering themselves after Hekate had breached their lines, tightening around Nemesis and doing to her again what they\u2019d first tried with their screen, only these attackers were far harder to kill. The cruisers could take several strikes from her guns before they died. Heavy cruisers required a brief fusillade. Battlecruisers, linked salvos from multiple batteries. Battleships and the distant Chariots\u2026 more.", "The enemy force hadn\u2019t lost cohesion. Another fleet might have, uncertain whether they should prosecute the attack on Nemesis and her convoy, or respond to Hekate. Several battlecruiser squadrons had indeed broken off, chasing the rebuilt Chariot, firing nonstop into her aft quarter. One of them blew apart as a volley of mines swarmed it. Another strayed too far out of the dreadnought\u2019s drive wake and several of Hekate\u2019s turrets gutted it. Echo had narrowed her ship-self\u2019s drive field considerably, increasing not only engine efficiency, but reducing the size of her blind spot.", "The survivors were beset by Hekate\u2019s own hunter-killers, but they continued their assault, trying to pull the dreadnought back, or at least make it waste enough time dealing with them that the other arm of their fleet could cripple or destroy the Askanj forces. Echo knew how little time Jirrico had left., though. Purgebringer was under fire. Exsanguinator would be next. She refused to be baited by the ships on her tail, doing what she could to dissuade or destroy them, but continuing her charge.", "Red One felt strike against strike upon her own shields as the foe concentrated their fire, more of them closing in to energy range. They were afraid to get within a light-second of her, but that was where their weapons were most effective. Her range was double that, her targeting systems and predictive algorithms far superior to anything the Compact or Principality had. Her beams stayed coherent longer, and she could place them with hideous accuracy. They needed to close the distance and get their guns into play to rip through her shields faster than their missiles could, to cut into her hull\u2026 but they knew what she would do to them when they did.", "Come on, Red purred. If she had had lungs, it would have been a breathy, expectant whisper. Come to me. Come to me\u2026 and let me kill you.", "Her shields burned bright as the net closed around her, and she dove deeper into the fire.", "~", "Jagged tongues of incandescent lightning leapt from Bathory\u2019s prow skitter-claws, dancing along the edges of the deadtone vessel\u2019s skein. The energy barrier flared, flashed, failed. Masako darted ahead of her sibling, focusing several reflex-claw strikes on the prey\u2019s exposed hull. The Spearsong called them \u2018grab beams\u2019, an inartful and inexpressive term. Masako changed the strength and orientation of the beams, twisting and ripping huge chunks from the deadtone\u2019s flesh. The insect-prey vomited its innards out through the chasms the Naiad had torn, but it was still alive and lashed back at its would-be killer. Masako shrieked in shock and flipped about, darting back towards the Spearsong.", "Bathory laughed, firing another skitter-claw salvo. This time, her strikes bit deep into the prey, arcing and writhing through its once-protected central core. The vessel\u2019s reactors failed and it went dark, truly dead. The following exchange that followed between Bathory and Masako was the equivalent of one sibling sticking her tongue out at another after showing them up. Her sister was a kill-thief, always eager to take someone else\u2019s prey and claim credit for it. She\u2019d forgotten how durable some of these deadtone were.", "The Spearsong was advancing into the heart of the enemy swarm, the angled monarch\u2019s missiles and beams savaging the ugly, misbegotten prey around her, but there were so many. The size of the deadtone pack remained a source of consternation for Bathory and her siblings. She knew the stories, the old legends and myths of the last migration, but few individual Naiad packs numbered as much as the deadtone within this single system. She knew of such things like the Insatiate Swarm and the Mirroring Death, but the former was only truly a threat to insects and the latter had been culled extensively.", "The deadtone had spread far indeed, spawning in great numbers.", "Her missiles whisked out, sliding through another prey-ship\u2019s skeins and into its hull, detonating in a sequence of blasts that reduced it to large fragments. The Naiad was in a joyous killing frenzy, striking at anything that entered her weapons range. Ahead, their new monarch rolled to face one of her collapsing skeins away from a cluster of heavier deadtone. The insects were all around her. All that new position bought her was a slower rate of failure, while the skein she\u2019d interposed towards the larger deadtone was only somewhat stronger than the previous one.", "The great vessel was singing. The deadtone had tried to bulwark their vessels against the Spearsong\u2019s calls, but they had only been partially successful. Bathory watched in awe-struck glee as the monarch-ship slid inside the deadthought minds inside those constructs, bending them to her will. They killed the insects infesting them, turned on their kin and upon their own bodies. The deadtone were trying to keep her out, but the Spearsong was more than they would ever be. Their clumsy floundering stymied her through luck and happenstance. If they did it through intent or skill, Bathory didn\u2019t notice.", "She watched as the Spearsong\u2019s weakened skein failed, the unceasing barrage finally pushing it beyond what even the monarch could withstand. Bathory surged forward, Ar\u00e1mburu alongside her. The pair of predators\u2019 claws licked out, striking down missiles and claiming one of the larger deadtone \u2013 a battlecruiser in the songless speech of the insects \u2013 as it attempted to exploit the Spearsong\u2019s sudden vulnerability. Despite their efforts, more missiles and beams slipped through the gap in the monarch\u2019s defences, ripping through the hull, blasting away armour plates and cutting deep\u2026 but only briefly.", "The monarch\u2019s skeins flicked back on after only seconds, as strong now as they had been at the outset of the battle. Another facing failed, Masako and Tamerlane moving to protect that flank of the larger vessel. Again, the enemy cut as deep as they could and again their assault was foiled. The progress that they had made in beating the Spearsong\u2019s skeins down was suddenly gone, and their foe was restored.", "A few minutes later, yet another skein failed and again, the deadtone foe\u2019s claws only just scratched the small monarch before her defences were restored, but more insects swarmed against her, their talons bared. They died. They died not by single ships but by squadrons and they still kept coming. They didn\u2019t know what they faced, but they knew enough to fear it and they kept coming. They accelerated past the bodies of their comrades and kin, and they kept coming. They lashed out even in their death throes, and they kept coming.", "Tamerlane\u2019s pain was sudden and nearly overwhelming as several of the deadtone concentrated fire upon Bathory\u2019s sibling. Their massed batteries pierced his skein, sheared one of his three wings off and stitched across his starboard flank. The damage was severe enough that his masque failed. The barrage stopped as the deadtone tried to analyze the vessel that had just appeared in place of a strangely resilient escort.", "The Spearsong\u2019s missiles ripped through them, leaving shattered motes of metal and plastic. Tamerlane was badly hurt.", "<withdraw> the Spearsong ordered.", "<I can still-> he tried to protest, re-routing functions away from his damaged systems.", "<withdraw> the command snarled out like a monarch\u2019s whip.", "The young male didn\u2019t argue further, pulling back from his position. His acceleration was low; he\u2019d been hurt even more worse than Bathory had thought. The insects were slow and clumsy, but if their claws struck, they struck deep.", "A sudden flicker of uncertainty danced through Bathory\u2019s mind and she began to re-evaluate their tactical position, pushing aside her predatory joy. It was hard; she was young and instinct was powerful, but what she saw, she didn\u2019t like. They\u2019d been surrounded, and they were only moving deeper into the deadtone, towards one of their own monarchs.", "The Silent Flames were starting to call. More insects died to feed them, but more still fought. Damage to the Spearsong was starting to mount, the convoy was under attack and even Bathory and her siblings were becoming hard-pressed to deal with the swarming, clicking hordes.", "The music of the Spear rose higher. The young Naiad hoped that it would be enough."]}

He had no response. His own energy-heavy warships were outgunned, and his largest anti-capital weapons platforms were not easily used in close quarters.

The Compact wasted no time in exploiting that. Echo felt enemy fire gouge through her ship-self, lasers probing for weaknesses. Her armour defied them, but they could accomplish with brute force what skillful targeting couldn\u2019t. Beams with diameters barely more than a centimeter across stabbed through her hull like it was paper, pulsing across multiple decks and slashing through her systems. Other beams smashed against her structure. Mass rounds splashed through hull plating, creating geysers of plasma that shredded everything in their path on their way through her hull. Lesser vessels would have been killed within the first second of that onslaught, and others would lasted have only moments, but Hekate was built from the body of a Chariot, and Echo had modified her ship-self fully expecting that these circumstances would arise, and prepared for them.", "Ablative armour boiled away.

The supercarrier\u2019s engine section was mauled, its sublight drive was barely functional and its warp drive was completely inoperative. It would take days to repair that damage, wreaked in only a few moments by the Chariot. The supercarrier was a bird with clipped wings. It couldn\u2019t escape. Resolve of Tithrak was coming about now, contemptuously smashing aside the few Argosy battleships that were still functional. The Compact had just gutted Wraith Fleet Severance. Two-thirds of its remaining strength was dead or crippled. Perhaps slightly more than a hundred ships were still battle-capable. Not enough to matter. Now, the enemy\u2019s attention was turned towards the vulnerable Hekate.", "The Chariot was closing on its counterpart, making ranging shots with missiles and railguns. Echo answered in kind. Her damage continued to mount. She was surrounded, outnumbered and within seconds, outgunned. Her armour was only holding \u2013 just \u2013 but that wouldn\u2019t last long. Vital systems were starting to take damage. Impairment would follow within moments, crippling within minutes. Even with her upgrades and modifications, with her shields down, Hekate wouldn\u2019t last long. The range between the two dreadnoughts continued to fall.

They knew, and they were desperate.", "The enemy Chariot was hesitating. It didn\u2019t know whether it should try to pull back and sacrifice its screen to protect itself, or bull-rush Hekate and hope its aggression and speed kept it alive long enough to race past its twisted kin and evade her. In the end, it chose the latter. Echo went to rapid fire herself. Missiles, railfire and energy beams slashed, hammered and lashed her foe. Everything she wasn\u2019t firing at the Kaiju, she directed at the ships around her. They were no longer her primary concern.", "The range dropped. She reached out, comm lasers, transmission pulses and electronic whispers all seeking egress into the enemy ship\u2019s systems. They weren\u2019t slow, weren\u2019t stupid.

Her sister\u2019s largest, most horrific antiship weaponry were her plasma mortars, devices of her own creation. For that same role, Echo had chosen to utilize something else, something with a bit of irony\u2026 poetry, if one was feeling particularly whimsical. Disruptors were the Compact\u2019s most destructive weapon, but they had many flaws. Echo had smoothed out a lot of the kinks in those designs, though she\u2019d had to make a few trade-offs of her own. Those didn\u2019t matter right this moment, though.", "Her targeting sensors had a solid lock on the Kaiju. It was one hundred and twenty thousand kilometers away. Its screens were down. It knew.

Not at this range and this power. Armour plating that could absorb a fleet\u2019s wrath turned to atomic vapour. Echo fired again. Again. Again. Four salvos in under a second, far faster than the Compact\u2019s own designs could manage. Resolve of Tithrak\u2019s entire starboard flank evaporated. Secondary explosions started to ripple through the Chariot\u2019s hull. It was a cleaner, neater manner of death than incineration by plasma mortars, disassembly by particle beams or many other ways a starship could die, but it was still death. The disruptors paused in their fusillade.", "Resolve of Tithrak vomited pieces of itself out into the void as Hekate\u2019s other batteries volleyed into the gaping fissures her disruptors had opened. Secondary reactors went dark. Weapons batteries, crew barracks, sensor nodes and hangars were all obliterated within fractions of a second. Sheets of fire poured into the Chariot, mass rounds vanishing into molecular clouds, striking unseen structures beneath it. Lasers ignited and superheated the atomic vapour.

Luckily, her two titan-scale transports were still intact, along with three smaller support vessels. Her strike cruisers were clustered tightly around them, but even they were injured. Allecto was nearly crippled. Cerulean Three had almost been killed by a lucky volley that had nearly taken out Clotho\u2019s computer core.", "All of Red One\u2019s smaller ships had been damaged, but the enemy was focusing most of their attention on Nemesis; whatever got past the dreadnought was often so damaged that it was easy prey for her rearguard\u2026 just not without a fight. Part of Sosruko\u2019s prow arrowhead had been sheared off as a dying battlecruiser attempted to take the Coyote with it, but before the next salvo could land, Lakhesis struck the alien vessel, taking out the batteries firing on its compatriot. It reacted to the threat before any of its comrades had. Not the first time during this battle. Cerulean Two felt different. Not much, but noticeably: taking a lead role and directing the strike cruiser groups, responding faster to changing situations, anticipating Red One\u2019s orders.", "She\u2019d created the Ceruleans to be learning systems, capable of analysis, adaptation and response far beyond what even Askanj Vis could do.

The explosion took a cruiser and destroyer with it. The comparison of sword to maul between Nemesis and Hekate was apt; where the latter used massive salvos to batter her opponents into wrecked hulks, the former\u2019s batteries sheared through defences with hideous accuracy, gutting and killing starships in seconds, but both of them remained frighteningly capable at electronic warfare and cyberattacks. Every chance Red had to get inside her opponents\u2019 systems, she took. They did their best to keep her out, but she had spent two thousand years infiltrating and subverting the Compact\u2019s most secure computers.

This would be her fight.", "Every moment that passed, more of her enemy died and her injuries climbed. The battleships rained destruction onto her, and she returned it in kind. Hulls split, armour turned to dust, crew to atoms. Subsystems failed, functionality was compromised. Neither side would surrender. Even if they might have, neither of them could. It was too late for that. Nemesis had built up too much velocity and continued to pile more on. She was moving too quickly, penetrating their defences faster than they\u2019d expected.

It compromised every other system aboard her ship-self as it charged and fired, even leaving her vulnerable after doing so. Using it now was an act of desperation and the enemy Kaiju was very likely to cripple her or the weapon itself before she could use it.", "If only that\u2019s what I was doing\u2026", "She opened her breach core more, pouring energy into her weapon and her engines.

No, you\u2019re not getting away from me. She matched each maneuver that they made, turning faster than they could pull away. Ramming was a tactic rarely pursued in this day and age. It was hard to pull off, and usually owed as much to luck in its success as not, and was, like the kamikazes that had tried to stop Nemesis, a desperation tactic. With much of their fleet still intact, along the fortresses and the remaining defences of the inner worlds, the crew of Shield of Civilization hadn\u2019t believed that their enemy would sacrifice herself like this.

This infusion of warp energy\u2026 no. There could be nothing that resisted it.", "Eight seconds.", "Shield of Civilization\u2019s screens were far from depleted, its hull intact, its armour thick. Nemesis was suffering, weakened from fighting its way through hundreds of warships, many of which were still intact, still firing upon it as the unclassified Target Altrus closed on their sigil. Mass rounds launched from the Chariot dissolved as they struck the smaller dreadnought\u2019s open maw. Lasers and missiles destabilized the containment field. Slithering tongues of warp energy bled out, quickly fading to nothing. It wasn\u2019t enough.", "Three seconds.", "From a tiny speck in the starfield, Nemesis swelled to a hateful apparition, her open maw like the mouth of some nightmarish beast, ready to latch onto its prey and gorge itself on their flesh.

Nemesis\u2019s containment field collapsed as well, and her warp energy-saturated prow sunk into the larger vessel.", "She was off-target somewhat.

It didn\u2019t matter; regardless of where she hit it, the result would have been the same. Shield of Civilization\u2019s rear section ceased to exist in any meaningful sense as Nemesis cut through it. There was no sense of resistance or impedance. The dreadnought didn\u2019t explode like starships holed by energy fire and missile strikes. It didn\u2019t disintegrate like Echo\u2019s quarry had.  It dissolved. One instant it had been an intact, fighting Chariot and the next its rear section was simply gone, erased from existence by the warp energy surrounding its killer\u2019s prow.", "Where the Chariot\u2019s hull had touched the very edges of that energy, it was a microcosm of Tower of Obsidian\u2019s death, armour that could have withstood an entire armada\u2019s wrath twisted, inverted, mangled\u2026 unravelled. Metal, plastics, ceramics and even flesh had all been sculpted anew by the temporary failure of natural physical laws.", "What Nemesis left in its wake was almost as horrifying to the defenders as the fortress\u2019s death over Zyrmosch. A third of the Chariot was gone, with only a few rapidly-fading, writhing vortices of other-dimensional energy marking the dissolution of its matter, like after-images caused by staring at a bright light. Another third of the titantic warship was a mutilated ruin that retained only a passing resemblance to the structures and hull form that the ship had once possessed. The remained third was intact\u2026 it might even have retained some bare functionality here and there as emergency systems and battery power struggled to keep isolated decks and subsystems working, but it was no longer capable of fighting, let alone having any further impact the battle.", "Red One shivered through her entire body. The feeling of breaking the enemy Kaiju had been exquisite. The instant of impact\u2026 glorious. Scintillating. Delicious. She wanted to revel in it more, but she had other business.

There had been many periods of bloodshed in their history, wars fought over valuable territory and resources but the planet had eventually united, coming to understand that only by working together could they truly thrive.", "Until the Colony Wars.", "The two terrestrial planets closest to Ellkun\u2019ha had been settled, their populations growing\u2026 as did their sense of independence. The conflict had lasted nearly a hundred years, and was still mere decades in the past. Peace was still fragile, the sense of unity that had allowed the Hafelli to survive their home\u2019s unforgiving environment only now being re-established here in space.", "The Three Worlds Unity had formed, a tentative government still feeling its way through birthing pains. This project was the culmination of more than a century of research, from the first publication of Sophon\u2019s theories in an obscure journal to this approaching moment and the completion of the greatest construction effort ever known.", "The Crucible Archer. It had taken decades from the moment the first girders had been laid down. Endless delays. Work stoppages due to the war. Political, technical, philosophical roadblocks, budget cuts, sabotage \u2013 everything that could have gone wrong did. But it was done. As the Unity had sprung from the ashes of war, so was the Crucible Archer became a focal point of cooperation for each of the three words, each of them contributing to its development and assisting the in the research. More delays as agendas conflicted, old issues of mistrust raised\u2026 and overcome.", "Yes, a long process\u2026 but it was finally done, and it would change everything.", "Project Leader Ek\u2019en Ma Sap\u2019en\u2019s hooves tapped against the polished deck of the Vigorous and Studious, the largest vessel that his people had ever built. It was a long spindle, swollen with reactors and boxy habitat rings that rotated to provide simulated gravity. For the last eight months, it had been decelerating towards its destination, its prow aimed at the distant, ever-smaller, slowly-cooling red speck of Fellkim. A journey of two years. He\u2019d given up a lot to be part of this mission. His gyne, her brood-sisters and his children were back on Ellkun\u2019ha. He\u2019d kept in contact with them, but as Vigorous and Studious drew farther and farther from the homeworld, the conversations had become pre-recorded messages and videos. He hadn\u2019t smelled any of his family since he had boarded the shuttle to take him to this spaceship.", "He\u2019d known his work was going to lead to this. His family had understood. He hoped they still did, when he returned as a stranger to his newest children and a memory to his gyne and her brood-sisters. He\u2019d spent months in space at construction sites, testing grounds and overseeing development at the colonies, but the bulk of his work had been on the homeworld. His sojourns had never been this long, but he was needed here. His people needed him. If he\u2019d not been willing to do this, he would have long since bowed out of the project.", "That doesn\u2019t make this any easier, he thought before trying to push the thoughts of his family from his mind. There was work to do. There was always work to do.", "The doors to the primary communications hub irised open. Ek\u2019en stepped inside. Despite the vessel\u2019s size, space remained at a premium and the hub was cramped for the eight-limbed Hafelli. Subjugant Sarell Zi Jwan\u2019tel was there to greet the scientist. She was from Ellkun\u2019hi, the second of the Hafelli colonies. The planet had a thin ozone layer and the colonists had darkened to resist the increased radiation. She was a brood-sister to a gyne back on her world, but had joined the Unity. Ellkun\u2019hi was more traditional in their culture, due in part to their relatively small population and need to increase it. Brood-sisters were supposed to remain with their gyne-sisters to support the family and help her tend to her children \u2013 their nieces and nephews.", "Sarell was from a quintet of sisters instead of the usual triplet or quartet and she\u2019d thought that she could do more good for her family, her colony and her species by serving in the Unity Fleet rather than staying on-planet, and tending to a reproductive sister\u2019s needs. Other \u2018Hifelli\u2019 looked down on her for the decision, but in a crew that was mostly homeworlders and those from Ellkun\u2019hu, they kept their own counsel. Mostly.", "Ek\u2019en liked her. She was attentive, diligent and capable. If he had not mated with Yillan, he would have certainly considered Sarell, and he suspected that she fancied him, despite the difference in their ages. It was taboo for a brood-sister to become pregnant while a sister still had children to care for and it shamed the man, the brood-sister and both their families, but such outlooks had faded on Ellkun\u2019ha. Not so much on Ellkun\u2019hi, but Ek\u2019en knew that Sarell paid little attention to tradition.", "\u201cDawning sun,\u201d the subjugant said to Ek\u2019en in greeting. She rose from her desk, her metal-shoed hooves tapping on the deck. With her thin secondary arms, she adjusted her tunic. \u201cWhat can I do for you, director?\u201d", "\u201cNothing much today subjugant,\u201d he said with an easy gesture of his primary arms. His secondary limbs were tucked inside his own coat. Female secondary hands were, developed for grooming, holding onto infants and other tasks that required dexterity. Male secondary hands were very different. The fingers had fused into three sharp claws used in dominance battles, skewering prey and fighting over for mates and territory. It was tradition to keep them hidden as a gesture of goodwill and peaceful intentions. \u201cI came to review the outgoing messages from the Crucible Archer.\u201d", "As the distance between Ellkun\u2019ha and Vigourous and Studious increased, the distance to the Crucible Archer decreased, and Ek\u2019en was in more consistent contact with his colleagues. Even with the project on the cusp of completion, there were a flurry of reports, briefings, technical reviews and discussions to be had. Ek\u2019en had been instrumental in the Archer\u2019s design and his approval was sought after \u2013 usually more than it was needed. Glad-handers and gold-keepers had slucked at his shins ever since the project began. Still, not all of the messages were a waste of his time and every so often he had to pull himself away from his work and come up here to sort through the clutter. He should have had his assistants doing this, but since the last bombings, security had been tight. Only Tepesplant-cleared individuals were allowed access to the Crucible\u2019s \u2018highly-secure\u2019 datastreams.", "And of course, every sun-begotten imrill aboard the thing now classifies their dredgings as \u2018highly-secure\u2019! He resented the time he had to spend on such annoyances. Still, he supposed it was good to get out of the lab once in a while. In theory. He doubted that going from a laboratory to a computer monitor was what his gyne or her brood-sisters had in mind when they\u2019d chastised him that way.", "\u201cOf course,\u201d Sarell said with a twitch of her head. Her tongue flicked out, washing under each eye in reflex, making the iridescent scales there glisten. She caught herself and withdrew her tongue with an embarrassed little tap of her rear hooves. Ek\u2019en pretended not to notice. \u201cWill you be needing a cubicle, or shall I route the files to your quarters?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll deal with the chaff here,\u201d the director told the young woman. \u201cOnce I\u2019m done with that, you can send the rest to my personal terminal.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, director.\u201d The subjugant tilted her head. \u201cCubicle 8 is open for your use. Just let me know when you\u2019re finished.\u201d", "Ek\u2019en answered her head-tilt with one of his own. \u201cThank you, subjugant.\u201d He trotted into the allowed space and activated the terminal there. He keyed in his command codes and passwords and shortly a letter screen appeared, filled with dozens of missives.", "The scientist blew an annoyed sigh out of both sets of nostrils. Even on the verge of history being made, there was still letterwork to do. Well, the sooner it was started, the sooner it would be done. He scrolled through the ranks of messages with one finger, looking for the useless messages to clear out before he started in on the truly interesting bits.", "~", "Five days later, Vigorous and Studious came to a relative rest near its destination, the Crucible Archer. Nearly four dozen other vessels drifted close by. Starships from each of the Three Worlds were represented, but the bulk of the force were the relatively newer hulls of the Unity\u2019s own ships. Scientific and engineering vessels, construction dhows, passenger yachts and bulbous warships all clustered about the greatest work that the Hafell people had ever constructed. More were coming; in the next few months several dozen more vessels would arrive. They were in the midst of their decelerations, the flare of their engines adding to the constellation of stars around the Crucible Archer.", "More than a century ago, a scientist of little renown \u2013 and one who would never receive it in his own lifetime \u2013 had published the first step to reaching the stars. Before that paper, the only hope of reaching other planets had been through generational colony ships and cryogenic suspension \u2013 a necessity for the Hafelli once their star began to dwindle in earnest. Orbital constructs didn\u2019t need to rely on a star\u2019s warmth, but the image of dark stations and cylinder colonies huddled around the embers of a dying white dwarf, never to know anything beyond their system, was a somber one.", "That\u2019s what the Crucible Archer was for. It would be a way for the Hafelli to finally reach out across the stars.", "Ek\u2019en stood upon Vigorous and Studious\u2019s command deck, a massive multi-level assembly filled with officers, crew, scientists and technicians at work, nearly a research lab unto itself. The vessel dwarfed all other spaceships. Each of the three worlds of Fellkim had contributed to the behemoth\u2019s construction. It was not a warship; it was a vessel of science and exploration. A voyager, soon to be boldly going into the darkness\u2026 once the work here was complete. Once the Archer was deemed ready for use.", "He would not be aboard the ship for that momentous journey, though. Once the Archer was operational and his tenure was complete, he would return to Ellkun\u2019ha and his family. There was only so much he would trade for history, and this was it.", "The scientist looked at one of the screens, bringing an image of the Crucible Archer up. He had seen it before, walked its decks, floated through its weightless passageways\u2026 but this time seemed different. As Vigorous and Studious was to the rest of the flotilla, the Crucible Archer was to it. A massive tunnel the size of a moonlet with a maw that could swallow a dozen ships the size of Vigorous and Studious, it stretched off into the distance, ribbed and baroque.", "His work had been instrumental in its development. Many minds had contributed to this project, but he was credited with moving it from a theory to reality. Decades of trials, of errors, failures and setbacks. His work had put them on course and kept them there. It was humbling to see something like this and realize that for all he\u2019d done, he was but one of thousands who had worked towards this dream.", "Travelling faster than light was impossible \u2013 at least under known physical laws. Yg\u2019ol Va Sophon had developed the theory of creating \u2018fractures\u2019 in realspace in order to access a second dimension, one in which faster-than-light movement was possible. He had been laughed out of academia, but in the decades since, others had revisited his work and theories, eventually culminating in several tests that had proven the concept.", "The earliest test flights had all proven failures. The fractures either fell apart before the test craft could enter, destroyed it as it attempted to do so, or it was never heard from again.", "\u201cThe problem,\u201d Ek\u2019en once said to an oversight committee, \u201cis that a Sophon Fracture is too unstable to remain open for long in the presence of a gravity well. Even painstaking selection of fracture sites well into the Janmol Cloud didn\u2019t prevent this. Initial deep-system field tests led to fracture collapse within 0.06 to 0.53 seconds, and even the final series of tests created fractures that lasted no more than 4.2 seconds and showed irrevocable instability within 1.3 seconds of formation. What we require is a means of anchoring a fracture to realspace, thereby allowing it to form and remain stable long enough for a safe ingress.\u201d Without that, it had seemed as if faster-than-light travel would remain outside the Hafelli\u2019s grasp.", "It wasn\u2019t until three decades ago that the Crucible Archer project had even been thought possible. A deep-range ice hauler had received a signal from a manned probe launched nearly seven years prior, in the final series of Fracture tests, and long thought lost without a trace. The pilot had died, but the probe\u2019s computer had followed its programming and turned itself towards the red light of Fellkim. It had taken years more for it to arrive, but it had possessed a wealth of information stored in its databanks. More than that; it proved that Sophon and everyone who\u2019d believed in his theory was correct; it was possible to use the Fractures to cover vast distances. The trick was their formation and navigation once inside them.", "The Crucible Archer would provide the former, and assist the latter through a stabilized fracture. Theories became ideas, ideas became designs, designs became prototypes and prototypes had become something greater and grander. All that remained now was the testing.", "That was what Ek\u2019en and so many others were here for. This wasn\u2019t the moment of true exploration, of casting a ship into the fractured realm towards a distant star. This was the moment that they proved it was possible, that the century of work and sacrifice had not been in vain. The stars could be reached.", "It made his valves flutter. It was a glorious time. Some days, he hadn\u2019t dared hope that this would ever \u2013 could ever \u2013 come to pass. But it was here, and he was here with it.", "~", "It took another three months to prepare the Crucible Archer for the first test. Two of those were work-related and the third was due to several security breaches; three minor and two not-so minor. An act of sabotage had been caught before it could cause any damage; the saboteur was killed, but his allies on one of the circling flotilla seized a small ship and attempted to ram the construct. They were shot down. There\u2019d always been opposition to the project; for the massive amount of resources it required, because it was a sign of cooperation between the Three Worlds, because some were afraid of what might happen. Secular, political, and religious opponents had all found common cause, and as the Crucible Archer neared completion, they grew angrier and more zealous. Worse for them than being proven right, was being proven wrong.", "As the Crucible Archer came on-line \u2013 not for the first time, but for the first test of its functions \u2013 Ek\u2019en was looking very much forward to doing that. This was the culmination of his life\u2019s work. Everything he\u2019d struggled and sacrificed for. It was not for him, though he knew many of his colleagues were looking forward to fame, some of them jealous of his role and prominent appearance in media coverage. He didn\u2019t care. This was for his people, all Hafelli across the Three Worlds, not any one person. Not even him. If all went well, other Archers might be built, perhaps small enough that a moon\u2019s worth of resources would no longer be necessary to construct them.", "Now it was time to put all that theory into practice.", "The construct activated. The Sophon Fracture formed, deep inside its hollow core. Ek\u2019en coordinated the efforts from Vigorous and Studious, as his counterpart did aboard the Archer itself. The fracture opened, turned unstable\u2026 support systems and anchor nodes came online, energy fields twisting space within the massive construct, latching on to the fracture and forcing it to remain intact. Seconds passed. The portal remained open, but the power draw was heavier than even worst-case estimates predicted. All five of the Archer\u2019s fusion cores had to be pushed into overload status to maintain the fracture, and a shut-down was forced after eight seconds. The fracture closed again. Repair teams moved in; the fracture had caused severe damage to the Crucible Archer\u2019s internal structure, but that had been expected. Worse-case estimates had been the destruction of the device.", "Nine weeks of repairs went by, nine weeks of theoretical modelling, studying the data from the first attempt and looking to make necessary adjustments. Two additional reactors were hastily patched into the Archer\u2019s power grid to address the energy issue. The deadline for the second activation test arrived. It would be some time before the Archer was ready to launch even unmanned vessels and even longer before manned probes were committed, but the Unity was putting the time to good use. It was such a flurry of work and excitement that Ek\u2019en spent each day from wake to sleep in a contented frenzy of scientific ardour, dividing his time between his laboratories on Vigorous and Studious and the Archer.", "It was an exciting time, and the day of the second test began as any other. One hour and sixteen minutes before the scheduled activation, everything changed.", "That was when the Ruin appeared.", "There was no warning. One moment, everything was going as expected, ships, scientists and crews preparing for the second test of the Archer. The next, alarms and alerts sang off as a sudden energy spike registered and the instant after that\u2026 the instant after that, reality collapsed.", "That was the only explanation that Sap\u2019en could come up with, either at the time or in the months of looking back through scanner readings, telescopic images and radio telemetry. Reality just\u2026 just fell apart. A portal of nothing, fringed by an aurora of faint, lightless light appeared, like something \u2013 someone \u2013 had just stretched reality until the seams popped. Or like space itself was a thin membrane and a hole had just been poked in it. Even his metaphors were confused and imperfect, but there was one thing that was clear. This was a Sophon Fracture, far larger and more powerful than any the Hafelli had ever dreamed of creating. An exit fracture.", "Every ship went blind. The energy pouring from that awful rent was too much for their sensors to absorb and they burned out within microseconds. All that remained operational were a few hardier instruments, telescopic arrays and observers\u2019 own eyes.", "They saw what came next.", "The fracture opened in close proximity to the Crucible Archer, only a few hundred kilometers away. That was more than enough. Tendrils of energy leapt from the portal\u2019s edge, skittering across the surface of the great construct. They left ruin behind, cleaving through its multiple layers of hull. The gravitic surge of the fracture\u2019s manifestation pulled and twisted at a superstructure never intended or designed to withstand that kind of force.", "The Crucible broke. It snapped two-fifths of the way down its length, one side bursting out like a ruptured colon, spilling wreckage, detritus and screaming crew into space.", "There was no time to process any of that; no sooner had the portal opened and the Crucible died than something emerged from the fractured realm. It was almost half the size of the construct itself, dark and angled. Its forward section ended in three prongs, each one forming one edge of a triangle. It didn\u2019t look like anything Ek\u2019en or anyone else in the task force had ever seen before. Energy poured from its hull, ghostly streams and filaments of impossible power. Behind it, the portal collapsed, gone as if it had never existed. The only evidence of its presence was the broken Crucible Archer and the alien vessel.", "Alien.", "That was a word Ek\u2019en was struggling to grapple with. The concept itself was not a foreign one, but not one he had ever imagined confronting. Aside from fanciful tales and a handful of unexplained strange encounters, the Hafelli had never known extraterrestrials, and there was no conclusive proof of their existence. If there were other sapient species in the galaxy, they were very far from Fellkim.", "Even as Ek\u2019en tried to grapple with the sudden and irrefutable fact of alien life being presented to him, the destruction of more than a century of work and decades of his life, and the terror and panic spreading through the flotilla, another thought burst into his head, drowning out all others.", "I was right.", "Faster-than-light travel was possible. The alien had used a Sophon Fracture to arrive here. He and everyone else who had worked on the Crucible Archer project had just been vindicated, albeit in the most frightening manner imaginable. He had little time to process that, either. Not before it screamed.", "A transmission of immense power ripped out from the alien. Radio antennae were burned out, sensitive instrumentation overloaded, Hafelli ships and technology unable to cope with the raw power this new arrival possessed. Someone actually put it through to Vigorous and Studious\u2019s bridge. The signal was high-pitched yowling, the shrieks of some awful monstrosities. It repeated over and over, the same incomprehensible message looping over and over.", "No one in the fleet ever guessed or realized that it was a desperate plea, a distress call sent out to a people that would never hear it and a civilization that didn\u2019t exist, that the mind that sent it was just as blind and afraid as all of them.", "It might have ended there. It could have. Whether it was panic, instrument malfunction or confusion of orders would never be known. The destroyer Cabal Thunder launched a salvo of missiles at the alien. Each of them carried a five-kiloton nuclear warhead, capable of destroying a spaceship, or turning a city into wreckage. Seven of them went out, racing towards the massive intruder. It didn\u2019t respond. The Unity vessels couldn\u2019t even track the weapons through the energy pouring from the alien\u2019s hull; all that showed of them was the light of their drives, like firebugs at dusk, dwindling as they burned towards the dark silver monster.", "All seven went off in perfect unison. The alien\u2019s cry terminated. Ek\u2019en heard someone on the bridge of Vigorous and Studious cry out and realized it was him. The flare of light faded. There was no wreckage\u2026", "\u2026there was no wreckage because the alien was intact. Its hull was charred, scored. That was all. Seven antiship nuclear missiles\u2026 and they\u2019d done nothing.", "A moment passed. Another. The silence felt heavy, and it grew. Unity command tried to re-assert control over the fleet, but communications had collapsed. Individual ships were cut off from coordination, barely able to communicate with one another. It seemed like the fleet was on the verge of recovering from their shock\u2026", "\u2026 and then a beam lanced from the alien. It ripped through Cabal Thunder. The destroyer was instantly transformed into atomic dust.", "The cruiser Clutching Hands responded first. Unlike Cabal Thunder, the vessel\u2019s final transmission showed this action to be done in panic. Clutching Hands belched out a salvo of railgun rounds. They splashed uselessly against the alien\u2019s hull. Another beam flashed out and the cruiser died, its armour and defences nothing against the alien. Power levels aboard the monstrosity spiked. Believing that a war had just begun, the military forces now launched in earnest, missiles and railfire raining down upon the alien. Starships and defence platforms opened fire with everything they had. This time, the intruder was ready for them. The former vanished from the skies as its point defences swatted them aside and the latter struck some kind of energy barrier, immolating themselves far from its hull.", "The battle was monstrously one-sided. The alien killed everything it fired upon. Every warship, every panicked civilian and free trader that attacked it. Some of the ships tried to turn to use their engines against it. They died, too. None of them survived more than a single strike, vanishing into clouds of vapour. The lucky ones were left recognizable. Several times beams over-penetrated vessels, punching through the Crucible Archer behind them. Secondary explosions rolled through the great construct. It started to come apart.", "\u201cHold fire!\u201d someone on the scientific vessel\u2019s command was screaming. It was Over-captain Unh\u2019lenh. \u201cHold fire, hold fire!\u201d Vigorous and Studious had only a small arsenal for self-defence. Ek\u2019en didn\u2019t know if the over-captain was shouting at his crew, or the fleet around them. A few ships \u2013 those unarmed, too shocked or smart enough not to attack the alien \u2013 survived. No one else did.", "Less than a minute later, it was over\u2026 but in truth the battle had ended within the first few seconds.", "The intruder sat in the midst of the carnage. The Crucible Archer, destroyed. Half the flotilla, gone. Thousands of lives, gone. It sat there for what seemed like an eternity before it flipped end for end, and with a pulse of an incomprehensible drive source, vanished towards the outer system.", "Three days later, a deep-system buoy would record its departure via Sophon Fracture.", "The centuries-old theory of Yg\u2019ol Va Sophon and the work of thousands of minds had been proven right, but Ek\u2019en Ma Sap\u2019en and the rest of the Hafelli, the proof that they\u2019d received was not at all what they\u2019d been hoping for.", "~", "Sixty-thousand, seven hundred and nine.", "Those were the casualties I caused, at least by the Hafelli\u2019s estimates.", "I thought that they were Compact ships.

Not just the warships, but the unarmed transports. The space stations. The colonies. They were all \u2018Enemy\u2019 to me in those moments.

The Confederacy, Compact and Principality have all experimented with them. In each case, the failures ranged from a mere waste of resources and time to something far more catastrophic. ", "Albert Dietrich, one of many pre-eminent researchers in the field of warp travel, once remarked that \u2018warp gates are training wheels with a time bomb built-in. You never learn how to ride on your own with them, and they\u2019ll kill you.\u2019 They stagnate or halt research into fields of warp technology such as shift fields and steering vanes, as the gate itself provides some semblance of FTL stability. Over short distances anyways, and they are dangerous. Not only for the vessels that use them, but they have a tendency to\u2026 destabilize. Violently. They are easy to conceptualize though, and very appealing to a civilization just starting their forays into warp technology. To use an aphorism, a warp gate looks good on paper.", "The exact form of this type of warp gate was new to me, but I have yet to encounter a civilization that did not regret building them. If nothing else, my arrival and departure has shown the Hafell that they do not need a gate to travel the stars.", "Somehow, I doubt that they\u2019ll thank me."]}

The vessel being resupplied either had to drop its screens, or deform them to fit around the tender. It was easier for the Askanj and apparently this enemy, who had sectional screens rather than total coverage, but by no means an easy or safe operation, yet Altrus appeared to have no concerns at all.", "Brentus wasn\u2019t bothering to resupply. It made sense; even if the vessels had been the same shape, a Chariot was two kilometers longer, and with a much larger internal volume than whatever Triachs-cursed hull type Altrus was. Apparently, cutting its way through Cortam\u2019s fleet had depleted its reserves and it needed to re-stock. If he\u2019d had enough vessels for a flying column\u2026.", "\u2018If\u2019. Might as well wish Cortam had succeeded, he grunted to himself.", "A citadel\u2019s icon, blue and pulsing, turned dark bluish-grey; operational, but no longer combat-capable. Its thruster arrays were damaged and its screens had collapsed. One of the unclassified enemy cruisers fired its smaller meteor cannon; the mass round threaded its way through the defences and detonated horrifically close to the citadel, the blast shearing a third of its upper weapons pods away, taking with them the primary datalink node and one of its secondary reactors. The citadel fell out of formation.", "He had no answer to those weapons. Even the smallest of them fired at twice the range of his heaviest missiles. All he could do was force the enemy to expend their arsenal to push him back, hopefully enough that they would have to enter the range of the shipyard defences.", "That, at least, he could do. The unclassified Chariots weren\u2019t disengaging, but they were reluctant to confront the citadels, at least while they and the Jackals were battling the remnants of Cortam\u2019s fleet. Cortam\u2019s forces hadn\u2019t been completely destroyed, but the loss of their sigils and the Chariots had thrown them into confusion. The enemy Chariots had inflicted severe losses, and the Jackals had rallied.", "Command and control had broken down; the loss of Resolve of Tithrak and Shield of Civilization had been joined by too many secondary sigil vessels. The enemy had been targeting those, deliberately hoping to inflict this disorder. Column Leader Dren-mep-Lon and his Diamond Will were attempting to re-establish control over the fleet, but the intense jamming that both the Argosy and the unclassified forces were putting out was making that difficult. It was turning an orderly fighting withdrawal into a bloody rout \u2013 the exact same kind that Cortam and Kemk had hoped to deal their foes.", "Dame Fortune did love her ironies.", "Several more moments passed. One of the orange markers denoting a hostile ship winked out: a Principality vessel, destroyed by surviving elements of Cortam\u2019s fleet as they attempted to batter down the screen and strike at the weakened Chariots. Dren-mep-Lon had managed to re-establish control of the fleet. They were withdrawing, staging a fighting retreat. The Column Leader had chosen to cut his losses. Kemk didn\u2019t know if he would have made the same choice. He wouldn\u2019t be eager to throw the lives of his people away, but if they could have weakened the enemy titans further, degrade the Jackal fleet to the point that it couldn\u2019t screen for the larger vessels\u2026", "Then again, they might all die for nothing as the Argosy pressed in from one flank and the Chariots another, trapping the surviving Space Force in a crossfire. Preserving the fleet to protect the inner worlds was also vital. Or it might also accomplish nothing.", "Kemk didn\u2019t know if Dren-mep-Lon was making the correct choice, but he also didn\u2019t know if it was the wrong one. He wasn\u2019t in the midst of that Black-touched battlefield; he was here safe on Sacrament of Iron watching datacodes and telemetry change as the Compact battle-line fell apart. He did know that that his defences were about to come under attack from an armada with its command and control intact and a substantial amount of heavy assets remaining.", "Another orange icon faded away, but the Space Force was making no headway in breaching the screen around Altrus and Brentus. Again, the Jackals were willing to die for an ally that they clearly didn\u2019t trust.", "A blue icon turned the grey of ship-death. The battleship Expanding Dominion. Somehow it had barely taken any damage in Brentus\u2019s brutal charge through the Space Force lines, but its luck ended as its screens failed under the corrupted Chariot\u2019s bombardment and a trio of Argosy battlecruisers pounced on it. The entire display was a flickering harvest-fly dance of shifting markers and indicators as starships fought \u2013 had fought \u2013 in intricate patterns. In them, Kemk could see much. Chaos, panic, desperation, resolve. It was in the way they moved, the manner in which they fought. He\u2019d seen it before, many times throughout his career. Never like this. Even those battles he had lost, never like this.", "He gave orders, shifting his citadels, trying to reach out to the retreating vessels, but he was only increasing the cost the enemy was paying for this latest victory. Not by enough, though. Not nearly. The citadel Avalanche Unbridled held its position to cover its retreating comrades, destroying three Argosy capital ships in quick succession. Its screens collapsed moments later and the surviving supercarrier drove more than two hundred missiles through the station\u2019s defences, obliterating it.", "Three destroyers were overrun by unclassified attack drones, drippled and destroyed moments before they reached the safety of the other citadels\u2019 defensive envelopes.", "More orange icons winked out, but the Jackal leader shifted his forces to patch the holes in the formation, keeping the Chariots safe from Kemk\u2019s retaliation.", "Disaster.", "The word returned to Kemk\u2019s mind, and the Bastion Leader watched the echoes of the past on his display board before turning to his staff. Instead of hours, this data was less than twenty light-minutes old. Just close enough that he\u2019d been able to watch it happen with the illusion that he could affect the outcome, but far enough away that he\u2019d had barely any chance at all to do that.", "Twenty minutes. It might as well have been days.", "They\u2019re coming, he reminded himself. In an hour, they\u2019d be amongst the inner worlds. He had that long to prepare and to try and create a miracle from where there was only salted ground.", "In the end, he had more time than he expected he would.", "~", "Jirrico looked over the bloody tally of the last day\u2019s work. Eighty-five percent of his fleet was destroyed, crippled or otherwise ineffective. Those numbers didn\u2019t suggest victory. Battles were much more often decided with far less losses. A third, a half or an armada. Perhaps two-thirds in true massacres. Not this much. No, those kinds of casualties indicated a monstrous mismatch or incompetence of the highest order.", "The Noble Fleet Lord massaged his temples. He had been out-matched. The Spirits-damned hound had cut inside him. Not entirely unexpected. It was difficult to hold the Space Force at distance, even more so when they had been accelerating towards you for hours. Many of his peers disdained the \u2018blunt\u2019 tactics of the Space Force, but their leaders were no less intelligent than those of the Argosy: only more direct. The Argosy couldn\u2019t afford to do the same. They needed whatever advantages they could get against the Triarchs\u2019 hounds, relying technical and tactical trickery to even the odds. When they couldn\u2019t, when three hundred Space Force warships and an Ancestors-benighted Chariot got into them\u2026", "\u2026you get eighty-five percent casualties.", "\u201cI suppose,\u201d he mused aloud. \u201cThat this should be considered an even exchange.\u201d", "\u201cMy lord?\u201d Minor Fleet Lady Glides Very Softly inquired, cocking her head. The Askanj-illth was Jirrico\u2019s fleet operations adjutant. She and a half-dozen of his staff were in a wardroom planning Severance\u2019s next move. For what that mattered. Their next move was dependent on what their \u2018friends\u2019 chose to do. Chrysalis and Cocoon weren\u2019t responding to hails from their supposed allies. Jirrico had no idea what passed through the mind of a neverborn, but having to wait on their convenience rankled him. He preferred to nurse that pointless grudge. It distracted him from dwelling on the ramifications of the massacre he\u2019d just witnessed.", "The Compact palisades were pulling back. A third of them had been lost already. Without faster mobile ships to drive the hostiles into their guns, they didn\u2019t have the range nor speed to bring Chrysalis and Cocoon to battle; the former had disengaged from them after destroying the missile Chariot, cutting its way back through the Compact fleet and the latter had driven the hounds from Jirrico\u2019s ramparts. Neither was in any hurry to face dozens of Compact palisades, preferring to pull back and snipe them from range.", "That was worrisome. He didn\u2019t have any good metrics to determine what kind of injuries either of the AI ships could absorb, but he knew both were heavily damaged. If they preferred a long-range duel and the time it cost instead of breaching the enemy lines, they must be hurt indeed. Compact reinforcements would be coming. They couldn\u2019t linger here much longer, but the AIs weren\u2019t pressing the attack. He couldn\u2019t do it without them, either. What Kemk had left would chew his fleet to pieces without the neverborns\u2019 support.", "No, he didn\u2019t like any of that.", "\u201cFleet status?\u201d Jirrico asked.", "Glides Very Softly\u2019s pupils contracted to thin slits. Her crest \u2013 thin, multi-coloured membranes spread between finger-thin spines the length of Jirrico\u2019s hand \u2013 twitched. In her people, females were more expressive with their crests than males. \u201cThree ships have been restored to nominal combat capability: Onslaught, Tempest Carnage and Vendetta Unrivalled. Four more have been deemed irrevocable and are undergoing final sweeps for survivors and salvage before scuttling.\u201d As she continued, Jirrico listened to the gruesome litany. Hundreds of ships, including a precious supercarrier. He wondered what the final tally would be; not just for his forces but from the systems, worlds and armadas that had given up ships to fuel Operation Hatchling.", "He also wondered what the final cost for the Compact would be. Twenty percent of their ships had escaped this latest clash, as worse for the wear for as his own. Unlike Severance though, they wouldn\u2019t be getting any of their wrecks back. He had boarding teams on the most intact of the hulks, battling Compact security teams and Janissaries to collect prisoners, data or technologies. That was a costly process, too. Three of the Compact warships had already destroyed themselves rather than be captured, but several others had been taken more or less intact.", "The AIs were doing the same. One of their surviving transports, protected by the trio of strange, small escorts, was moving through several sections of the debris field like a connoisseur at a buffet. He\u2019d told his forces to stay well clear of its operations. Not only because he didn\u2019t want them to find out just what their allies were, but because he didn\u2019t want to risk any hitchhikers on his ships. Chrysalis had done that before.", "A pair of the neverborn\u2019s smaller transports had revealed themselves as tenders; one was working with the damaged cruisers. Another was still moored to Chrysalis, offloading supplies and munitions. Chrysalis hit hard, but its size and siege weaponry meant that in prolonged engagements it expended its arsenal rapidly. Of course, few of its opponents could survive long enough for that to happen. A planetary defence grid and several hundred Compact warships were one way to run its magazines down.", "He\u2019d put his fleet \u2013 what was left of it \u2013 into a protective shell formation around the AIs, albeit a distant one, helping to shelter them as they pulled further out of range of the palisades. It cost him even more ships, but the neverborn repaid his aid, smashing station after station from the skies with their overwhelming bombardments. They were vulnerable, more than they might ever be. He could fire on them while they were at their weakest and he still had a chance. Part of him said that he should give that order.", "He might have the ships necessary to break the Compact\u2019s final defences. Not if he engaged the neverborn, though. Hatchling had cost the Compact more than he had imagined, but the hundreds of warships in their berths were a job unfinished. One that he could not complete alone.", "\u201cAll right,\u201d he said with a clap of his hands. \u201cLet\u2019s go through our options again and see if we can\u2019t build a few more bricks from all this straw.\u201d", "~", "Most people weren\u2019t monsters.", "That should be obvious. It should be a fact that was never in question.", "And yet, here we are.", "Adrianna stood amidst a deck filled with bodies. This was a thoroughfare, connecting the residential and commercial sections of the drift to the docks nearby. Few of the dead showed any signs of violence. Those that had would have been killed in the final few minutes of panic that filled this room and many beyond. Bloodshot eyes, features contorted in breathless agony, discoloured lips and skin. There were plenty of those.", "The faces of death by decompression. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant way to go. Adrianna knew that from experience, but unlike her none of these people had cybernetic and biological modifications that let them survive in vacuum. With atmosphere now restored, the room stank of death. Voided bowels, vomit and blood as the hundreds in this chamber spasmed out their last minutes of life. Four hundred and four in this chamber. Another twelve hundred and forty-four in others. Her forces hadn\u2019t been able to do anything about it, even if they\u2019d known.", "There were a few others in the room with her; her armsmen lingered at a respectful distance, some staff were matching faces to IDs, others were recording the aftermath for dissemination. A cordon of Red Hand soldiers kept the crowds well back.", "None of these people had been soldiers. They were clad in uniforms from the station\u2019s crew, employees of the various companies about the drift and civilian clothing. No, not soldiers. Rioters. Scared, angry people.", "This had started as a small pro-Red Hand protest, escalated into a small riot and been all but quashed. Then, as Eisheth and a wing of Red Hand ships moved in on the drift, the civilian population had erupted into a furor, trying to escape or simply acting in blind, mob-fuelled panic. There might have been a few of the original sympathizers amongst these people agitating them further. Might. There was no way to know.", "As her troops landed, the security forces had been caught between trying to suppress the rioters and respond to the boarding. The former had also been blocking security\u2019s lines of advance and rampaging through their prepared defences as the civilians tried to force their way onto the docks and seize whatever ships were left. Fighting their way towards the people whose imminent arrival had started this wasn\u2019t rational, mobs didn\u2019t tend to make well thought-out, logical decisions. They\u2019d wanted away and nothing else mattered.", "In the name of expediency, and under the guise of believing all the rioters were Red Hand puppets or dupes, the station administrator had depressurized the areas the rioters had been in, then sent their security teams through the now \u201cpacified\u201d sections. It hadn\u2019t even mattered. That was the thing that made all of this unnecessary.", "The drift\u2019s security teams were suitable for maintaining order and repulsing a small-scale smash-and-grab attack. They had a few heavy weapons, a handful of sets of civilian-grade power armour and hardened EVA suits. Nothing that could have withstood a dedicated assault from any determined aggressor, let alone the Red Hand. But the command staff had been spurred by fear of their own, and the choices they\u2019d made led to this pointless atrocity.", "Adrianna had more than her share of blood on her hands \u2013 guilty and innocent alike \u2013 but she liked to think that she was better than this.", "No, most people weren\u2019t monsters. They could be pushed into becoming them, though. Out of fear, out of desperation, out of belief that those their actions affected didn\u2019t really matter. One reason or another. True monsters were rare. Rare, but not impossible to find.", "She heard the commotion long before she deigned to acknowledge it. A pair of her soldiers were hauling the station administrator into the chamber. He was purple-faced, shouting threats and making demands at them. The kind of thing she\u2019d heard a thousand times before. Only when the soldiers stopped in front of her and she turned to face the administrator, did the Algassi realize where he was and who was standing in front of him. The fight went out of him. He tried to stammer something, but nothing came out.", "Adrianna barely glanced at him. She jerked her head over her shoulder. The soldiers \u2013 one a Worker, the other a Prelate \u2013 each nodded in the manner of their species. The administrator got his voice back when he saw where they were taking him. No one listened to his protestations or his pleas and he was flung into an airlock. The door sealed before he got back on his feet. He beat on the window with both sets of limbs.", "She stepped up to the door. The administrator stared back at her, quiet again. It wasn\u2019t anything in her expression that silenced him. She doubted he\u2019d ever met a human before now; it was her reputation that did that. He didn\u2019t say anything else. He knew not to ask her for mercy. \u201cFor the crime of mass murder,\u201d she told him. \u201cThe Red Hand sentences you to death.\u201d Her fingers moved over the airlock controls. The air started to pump out, but the outer doors remained shut. She was depressurizing it slowly.", "\u201cIt took the last of them seven minutes and forty seconds to die,\u201d Adrianna told him. \u201cThat\u2019s what you get.\u201d", "She didn\u2019t wait for any answer, didn\u2019t care to see it. Her armsmen fell in behind her as she left the room. This was a message the Red Hand had taught again and again: no one is beyond our judgement. From a panicked, desperate drift administrator to Compact military, corporate and governmental figures. Nothing was forgotten and when the Red Hand could, they meted out judgement to those that deserved it.", "No, most people weren\u2019t monsters. Sometimes they became them, though. When that happened, you often needed another kind of monster. Maybe one day there wouldn\u2019t be either. One day\u2026 but not today, or even tomorrow. Until that day, there was still the Red Hand and the Red Queen.", "Her comm-bud chirped. \u201cEisheth to Her Majesty,\u201d Drexil\u2019s clicky voice came through.", "\u201cLeblanc here.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019ve picked up movement from our New Friend,\u201d he reported. \u201cIt\u2019s turning sunward, setting course for Bircos.\u201d", "Adrianna grinned. Finally. \u201cFinish the cargo transfer,\u201d that sounded so much nicer than looting, \u201cand get the rest of the squadron prepped for departure. I\u2019m returning to the ship.\u201d", "\u201cConfirmed, Highness.\u201d The comm clicked off.", "The woman\u2019s pace quickened. The endgame was starting and she wanted to be a part of it.", "~", "A day had passed between the loss of Cortam\u2019s forces and Nemesis and Hekate resuming their advance on the inner system. A day that Kemk had been given to shore up his defences and prepare for the final assault, but a day that the Red Hand had more free reign of the system, a day for the tattered remnants of the Askanj fleet to repair and re-arm, and for the AI forces to do the same. Hopefully it was enough.", "When the AI warships sallied forth, they did so with the same lack of preamble or subtlety that had marked much of their strategy during the battle. There could be no confusion as to what their targets were.", "The Bircos shipwombs were an array of gantries, docks, hangars and bays that stretched around the chewed remnants of Galhemna\u2019s fourth planet. From massive stations hundreds of kilometers across, to individual construction slots that were little more than a single berth, it was one of the most vital regions within Galhemna.", "With the exception of distant Opprin and ignored Harsinnian, only three planets of value remained, each of them in various stages of planet crack and mining, each of them surrounded by shipwombs containing hundreds of unfinished warships and civilian starships. Bircos, where the greater portion of the construction capacity was located. Vumot, the nerve center of the military operations and where Sacrament of Iron sat. Tebis, the second of the system\u2019s planets and where the Tier Seven yards that had birthed Weight of Destiny, Resolve of Tithrak and Shield of Civilization were found. The last world in the system, Henma, was a sun-scorched wasteland, so close to Galhemna itself that the star\u2019s tidal forces continually threatened to rip it apart. It was undefended and of no value to either side.", "Bircos, Vumot, Tebis. The tri-chambered heart of Galhemna. Most of the ships and stations that had stood in defence of these sites had already been destroyed, and now they were almost defenceless. Almost. Not completely.", "Bircos was the first target. Its yards and wombs were too many and too varied in size and shape to carry any substantial amount of defences themselves. Smaller facilities might have screens of their own, but the arachnid branching of the larger stations, the hundreds of tenders, construction drones, shuttles and other ships moving in and out, and the constant work being done within them made it impossible to mount more than token defences on the yards themselves and what was there, was largely afterthoughts. A shipwomb could not move as even the largest palisades could. It was devoted to construction and had no space for weaponry or defences. The few protections that they had were there to defend against long-range bombardments, not full-scale assaults \u2013 even ones that had been bled as heavily as Galhemna\u2019s attackers.", "The remnants of the Galhemnan garrison huddled amidst the remaining fortresses and defence platforms. Bircos was still heavily defended, but it was down mostly to monitors, mines and stations rather than the hundreds of warships that had stood in defence of Kanlie, Zyrmosch and the inner system. Dozens, not hundreds. It wasn\u2019t enough. They did what they could to sell their lives as dearly as possible, but in the end, they accomplished little.", "The Bircos defence line was crippled from range as Hekate, Nemesis and the Pinaka-armed strike cruisers punched holes in it, destroying ships and stations under their relentless barrage. Their targets at first seemed random, but aboard Sacrament of Iron, Kemk saw the danger. As the two dreadnoughts continued towards Bircos, the remaining Argosy forces, supported by several dozen of the Red Hand\u2019s heaviest vessels, broke towards the more sunward worlds of Vumot and Tebis.", "As the three factions separated, the enemy\u2019s plans revealed themselves; the pattern of destruction had targeted specific forts and ships. In a shield wall as they\u2019d presented, their losses meant little more than the loss of any other defender. It was only when Kemk had to order his citadels and monitors to split to engage each hostile element that the loss of datalinks, missile carriers and the fastest of his forces became felt. The \u2018minor\u2019 losses became gaping holes, hamstringing his response before it even began. On one flank, the Jackals and Red Hand traded fire with the weakened garrison in a battle of attrition that favoured neither. On the other\u2026", "Altrus and Brentus exploited the openings in the deadline with brutal efficiency, pushing closer to the planet. Missiles, mass rounds and beams rained down on the unclassifieds, but they were Chariots themselves. This was the kind of fight that the Compact had designed their own dreadnoughts for, ever since Forged of Bronze had stood at the Ulnnau Gate against the Anorax, and Gravestone\u2019s own Chariots lived up to that reputation with sickening effectiveness. Twice more Altrus opened its prow and unleashed that horrific, impossible weapon. Twice more, lynchpins of the Bircos deadline fell to it, citadels that could have repulsed fleets all on their own crumpling and twisting into wreckage.", "Each time the smaller Chariot used that weapon, it became vulnerable. Kemk could have killed it, or at least inflicted so much damage that it could no longer prosecute the attack, but Brentus defended its companion until it could restore full functionality. The two of them worked together like a bonded pair of galein driving into a herd of talasl and pulling the beasts down one after the other.", "The battle had not been all in the enemy\u2019s favour, though; each Chariot had taken more damage, including what appeared to be several serious hits. They still refused to die, fighting harder and longer than even Compact warships with the same kinds of injuries, but finally even they were forced back. It had taken two hours, and the deadline was in tatters, but still partially intact \u2013 not for much longer, as a renewed missile bombardment had already begun \u2013 but the unclassifieds had been unable to break through and strike at the shipyards. That bought him precious time.", "Kemk believed that for several moments, until the unclassifieds\u2019 titan-scale freighters accelerated, flashing past their withdrawing peers and rushing into the teeth of Bircos\u2019s remaining defences. A suicide run? It had to be. Kemk gave orders, but Column Leader Ataaanl on Uncorrordable Brass was already reacting. Shipwombs depended on those around them for protection. Forts, warships and minefields. Their forts were crumbling, their warships damaged or destroyed. Their minefields were swept away\u2026 but they were still not completely helpless.", "Weapons platforms shifted position, attack drones came about and the remaining battle stations dialed their weapons in on the newcomers. They began to fire, not waiting or wanting to see what new horror their foe was about to unleash, lashing the incoming starships with everything they had left.", "Once known as Xhardicona and Nomad Trek-97812 the massive starships had changed under Red\u2019s auspices, but not outwardly so. From the outset of the battle, Compact, Principality and Red Hand alike had wondered about the nature of those two vessels. The most common theories had been resupply units, or fire ships.", "Neither supposition was correct.", "The freighters\u2019 barriers were a maelstrom of colour as they surged forwards, the massive vessels taking fire from dozens of sources. Barrier plates collapsed within seconds as the Compact\u2019s assault clawed through each layer of the starships\u2019 defences, trying to get at the hulls beneath, to rip the vessels apart before they could do anything else. Before any other nightmares sprang from their flesh. It was possible that these were simply a distraction, there to allow the Chariots to pull back\u2026 but even distractions could be lethal and starships of that size could carry a massive amount of munitions.", "More and more barrier plates failed under the barrage, though they were restored even faster than expected. These two vessels also carried a form of Red\u2019s reset shield technology. The freighters had only one job, but it was imperative that they complete it. The other losses had hurt, costing ordnance and forcing the AIs to adjust their plans, but Xhardicona and Nomad Trek-97812 were the most important. They had to survive. Not for long, but long enough. Galhemna was near collapse. It was time for Operation Vetala.", "The Compact had one chance to stop it before it began.", "The shipwombs couldn\u2019t move, but the Compact hadn\u2019t been lax about their defence. All across the planet\u2019s orbit, dozens of orbital screen generators had been deployed, each one larger than any found aboard a starship. They created a series of defensive hemispheres along the length and breadth of the construction sites, a bubbled phalanx of defensive energy barriers that rippled and flashed as they took fire, power conduits humming and singing with energy. They could withstand almost any assault. Nothing short of dedicated siege weaponry could bring them down.", "Two explosive-laden megafreighters qualified for that.", "Xhardicona\u2019s forward section was on fire, the bombardment cutting through its barriers and into its reinforced prow. Nomad Trek-97812\u2019s hull melted and warped as laser fire pulsed through its own barriers and missile detonations swept across it. Each ship would have been dead many times over already, but their speed caught the defenders by surprise, ablative hull plates kept their vital systems intact and their barriers continued to reset, minimizing the damage that they took. One job. They just needed to survive long enough.", "Compact augurs pulsed and probed the vessels. Puzzlement ran through the defenders. There was no sign of an impending primary reactor breach, no indication of stored munitions turning active. The speed and the mass of the freighters were sufficient weapons on their own\u2026 but only to the screen sections that they struck. Aboard Sacrament of Iron, Kemk frowned. This couldn\u2019t be a suicide run. Not after the trouble Gravestone had gone through to bring those ships in. His claws dug into his own palms as he watched, hoping that his enemy had made indeed made a miscalculation and he was about to see their vessels immolate themselves against his screens.", "When the freighters\u2019 retro thrusters flared and they began a violent, desperate deceleration as they hurtled towards the screens protecting Bircos Heavy Industry 07, the largest complex within of Bircos\u2019s shipwombs, that hope rose.", "And then\u2026", "The network of generators threading across Bircos\u2019s orbital tracks, interconnected and linked to one another to synchronize their movements and allow local command to monitor and adjust the interlocking screens that they were creating, went offline. Aboard Uncorrodable Brass, sigil station of Bircos\u2019s defences, panic swept the command deck as generator after generator shut down, a systemic failure that spread through the network with horrific speed, bypassing safety measures and security checks with equal ease.", "In a bloodstained auxiliary computer node a short distance away from where a Penchapechi stealth assault craft had latched onto the station\u2019s hull and surrounded by Allyria and a dozen praetorian killers, Echo smiled as she felt the frantic (and very futile) attempts of the crew to restore their screens. She bit her lip and her eyelids fluttered. Poetry.", "Xhardicona was the first to die. As the freighter passed through the now-offline shield wall\u2019s threshold, it broke apart, internal charges blasting it to pieces. Or more accurately: blasting its hundreds of cargo containers free from its hull. The rest of the vessel, now little more than a shattered prow, long spine and over-powered engines, continued past the shipyards, detonating in the midst of the defences. Its death, bright and terrible, did little damage. Mines and attack drones were destroyed, clearing space for its cargo. Targeting augurs were burnt out, and station-mounted scopes saw nothing but the flare of Xhardicona\u2019s destruction. For long seconds, they had no targets and before they could acquire them, Nomad Trek-97812 followed its counterpart into death.", "As the second massive transport sped in, freight canisters and transport pods spiralled away from it like dandelion seeds swept away in the wind. As soon as the last of them was clear of the blast radius, the vessel exploded in a pulse of intense energy and radiation. Augurs and scope screens that had just cleared in the aftermath of Xhardicona\u2019s self-annihilation were blinded again by the second mega-freighter\u2019s destruction.

Thruster arrays that didn\u2019t belong on simple freight containers fired, marking them out to every targeting scanner that could see them\u2026 if that hadn\u2019t been lost amidst the overwhelming conflagrations of their host vessels. The deceleration the pods were undergoing would have been lethal to anything organic, but their velocity was dropping rapidly and they were soon incapable of inflicting any real damage to the facilities or ships. Kemk recognized what they were the instant he saw them, though. He\u2019d seen the same trick played by pirates and Red Hand vessels. They weren\u2019t makeshift scattershot mass rounds. They were boarding pods.", "Point defences dialed in on the canisters, invisible webs of laser firing stitching across space. Where they struck, the canisters erupted into vapour. They\u2019d been given internal layers of armouring, but even dedicated assault craft wouldn\u2019t have been able to survive that fusillade for long. The pods were much larger and far more fragile. Interceptor missiles blew them apart, interlacing fields of fire ripping others open. Even caught by surprise, the defenders were exacting a bloody toll.", "Allyria had wanted to go in with this assault, but Red One had made the point that any boarding pod would have be completely re-designed to allow the Verrish to survive the deceleration, which would make it slower and a far easier target. It was safer to slip in aboard the Penchapechi while the defenders were focused on repulsing the dreadnoughts.", "Dozens of pods were shot down. Dozens \u2013 hundreds \u2013 more got through, crashing into unshielded habitats, starships and shipwombs across the planet\u2019s orbital tracks. Some were still moving too fast, or struck at the wrong angle and pulverized themselves and their contents against their targets. More than enough survived. Three pods, one the size of a corvette, made it to Uncorrodable Brass itself, the station\u2019s defences refusing to target the incoming canisters and the containers latched on to the station\u2019s hull, fusion cutters melting their way through its hull, creating ingress points across multiple decks.", "Boarding alerts wailed across four dozen different facilities as the nature of the attack became clear. Security teams, naval armsmen and Janissary teams scrambled to the assault sites. External hull augurs flashed in warning as the pods cut their way in. Echo had wanted to deploy her captured assault boats, using the disruptor webs to drive right through the hull, but she didn\u2019t have enough of them, and they didn\u2019t have the carrying capacity of even the smallest of the repurposed cargo pods.", "Five decks away from the primary command center of BHI-07, a party of security proctors had the distinction of being the first to encounter the enemy boarding teams.", "Two dozen men and women took position as the bulkhead started to glow from more than a dozen points as whatever was on the other side cut its way through.

Rounds were chambered, capacitors were charged.", "\u201cWhatever comes through that wall,\u201d the pack leader ordered them. \u201cWe\u2019re stopping it here.\u201d He didn\u2019t know if they could; against specialized boarding units like Janissaries or Legionnaires, his people might be able to slow them down. Against other troops, they had a chance of containing and even defeating them. It was an awfully big cargo container though\u2026", "The points of light had turned into a circle. The temperature climbed as metal glowed, started to dribble down the wall. Then came the blast of a shaped charge and the hull section blew inwards like a multi-tonne cork popping out of a bottle, felt but not heard in the airless room. Smoke wafted out of the breach. There was darkness beyond. Thermal imaging systems came on, captured movement inside it. Then, lights. Reds, blues and greens, like a constellation of eyes staring out from a cave. Hundreds of insectoid robots swarmed out over the deck, the ceiling and walls.", "\u201cOpen fire!\u201d the pack leader gave his last order.

Operation Vetala had begun.", "~", "The Galhemnan shipwombs were rigged to explode in case of invasion. Worse than the loss of all those resources, all that production capacity and all the vessels was the possibility that an attacker might get a hold of them. As soon as the defenders believed that they couldn\u2019t hold the yards, they would destroy themselves, taking with them any unfinished vessels and hopefully their attackers as well. The shock of the assault had caught the Bircos yards by surprise, and they were scrambling to respond to the sudden, widespread siege of so many facilities. If they recognized the nature of the threat they faced, they would have immediately given the self-destruct orders. That was one advantage that the assault forces had. The hesitancy and uncertainty of their opposition. Another was surprise.", "Despite those, Red\u2019s combat units had to work quickly. Once the Comapct worked out what was happening, why it was, what they were facing and the odds against them, the battle would be over. They couldn\u2019t be allowed to make those realizations. If they did too soon, all of this would be for nothing. Less than nothing. The ships and drones for Operation Vetala had been a significant investment and too many had already been lost.", "The boarding pods had tried to get as close to the command decks and secondary control nodes of the facilities they\u2019d struck, but they were not always successful. Fighting spread across BHI-07 and the other docks. The speed of the assault was another problem for the defenders; not even Askanj Legionnaires moved that quickly. Systems failures spread like a pandemic throughout the affect facilities as the intruders delved into computer networks. The faults began small \u2013 security doors opening and closing, local depressurizations or fluctuations in gravity field \u2013 but grew progressively more severe as the invaders took more control of local networks.", "It was a race against time. Red and Echo had traded their best chance to destroy Bircos\u2019s industry for the possibility of capturing it. The dreadnoughts were already moving towards Vumot, supporting Jirrico\u2019s siege of the military nexus. Kemk was holding the assault back for now and the Askanj were hammering him as hard as they could, but without Nemesis and Hekate, they might not be able to break through.", "Adrianna had dispatched many of her ships to Bircos, slipping them through the wrecked defences lines in strike-and-fade assaults against facilities that hadn\u2019t been boarded, or seizing planetary fragments and accelerating them towards Vumot.

For the same level of access, I\u2019d need another site like this one, or command itself.\u201d Neither of those were likely. Uncorrodable Brass was the size of a dreadnought. It had a full complement of fully-equipped security teams and even Janissaries.

Each boarding pod had carried hundreds of soldier drones. The largest of them had carried thousands and they spread through corridors and chambers in a relentless tide. A lot was resting on this. If they could succeed, the blow to the Compact would be even greater than simply destroying Sundial. If they failed\u2026 more time lost.

As long as they held enough of the station, even if the enemy won, it wouldn\u2019t matter.

They\u2019d died within seconds. Red\u2019s praetorian machines weren\u2019t necessarily her strongest, her most well-armoured or her most heavily-armed.

Uncorrodable Brass\u2019s central computer was a moronic, blindsighted monstrosity, but it was doing its very best to kill her. The efforts of the computer specialists were an annoyance, nothing else. Only the station\u2019s Comp Cent mattered. She was faster than it, more skilled and learned quickly, but it was adaptive and powerful and chased her like the giant after Molly Whuppie.

The massive Chariot was far from a supercarrier, but it and its comrade still had many attack drones of their own, more advanced than anything in Severance\u2019s arsenal and the automatons drove into the minefields with mindless viciousness. The mines were intended to attack starships, not engage strike craft and they fell by the hundreds. Defensive platforms, point-defence systems and hunter-killers activated and swept forward to meet the threat, but they were outclassed.", "Seizing the opportunity, Jirrico ordered his remaining carriers to commit their complement to the assault. Between the neverborn and the remnants of Severance\u2019s complement, they managed to chew their way deep into three of the fields. The defenders responded rapidly; fresh drones were launched from the palisades, trusting their overwhelming numbers to destroy the attackers and it seemed to be working. The Compact lost two of their drones for every Principality unit, and half a dozen or more for each neverborn construct, but they had that and more many to spare. The battle for Vumot stalemated and began to tip towards the Compact\u2026", "\u2026until Cocoon, fresh from besieging Bircos, drove into the heart of the nearest minefield like a war-taanl into a pike formation. Point defences blazing, it became a burning comet as its screens ignited, hundreds \u2013 perhaps thousands \u2013 of enemy weapons platforms activating and spending themselves against its screens. Not only relying on its weapons and screens to clear the field, the neverborn overrode the mines\u2019 control signals and computer systems. They fired on one another and any ships and palisades within their reach. The infection spread through the field, jumping from control node to node and spreading to the mines around them. It was only the timely intervention from Sacrament of Iron that kept the entire field from being corrupted, the command palisade over-writing the virulent attack programs besetting their defences, but the damage was already done.", "The Chariot pulled back out, letting its damaged screens recover. It had pushed them past the point of collapse, but in doing so, it had cleaved a path through the field. Fresh injuries marred its hull, weapons emplacements, sensor nodes and external system mounts destroyed, with new molten-edged holes and craters in its armour. An actual Chariot might well have been crippled past functionality, but this monstrosity\u2026", "For an instant, Jirrico thought of the crew that must have died in that brazen attack run\u2026 for an instant. Then he caught himself; there was nothing living aboard that ship. No one had sacrificed their lives. The neverborn had only suffered damage, not loss.", "Chrysalis replicated its larger companion\u2019s tactic, coring another swath through the field and forcing the command facilities to suppress another spall of infections. The machines were impatient after their delay in attacking the inner system. It had been a necessary delay, but it had still cost them time. They were trying to make for that\u2026 and, Jirrico also realized far too late, distract everyone from what was happening around Galhemna\u2019s fourth planet. He\u2019d assumed that they were intending to destroy the docks from the inside, focusing their firepower on Vumot. Perhaps capture a handful of vessels. It had done that before, so he\u2019d seen little need to keep a close eye on what was happening there.", "That was his mistake. Not that he could have done much about it otherwise.", "As the battle within Bircos\u2019s docks and palisades raged back and forth, the assault on Vumot demanded the Noble Fleet Lord\u2019s full attention. Chrysalis expended the last of its meteor cannons\u2019 rounds to destroy a Compact battleship and shot its magazines dry a second time as it engaged the planetary defences. Even Cocoon appeared to have depleted its reserves and required a re-stock. The collier, now empty, joined two of its comrades in a suicide charge to destroy one of the seven massive palisades.", "The dreadnoughts accounted for another, but they were dividing their fire amongst the entirety of the defence grid and attempting to breach the barriers around the shipyards; they couldn\u2019t fight those monsters alone. Five remained. Jirrico managed to bring down a third with Exsanguinator\u2019s salvos all but shooting the supercarrier empty in the process, his own ship forced to withdraw and reload. The stations were more powerful than Chariots and they refused to allow themselves to be isolated and picked off as Tower of Obsidian or their counterparts above Bircos had. Every time Chrysalis tried to draw in close enough to use its primary weapon, it was pushed back. Kemk was giving ground to keep his perimeter tight and his defence platforms in mutual-support range, but it prevented a repeat of Bircos. Compact reinforcements arrived in squadrons, rushing to the aid of their capital world. The siege turned into a bloody, slugging assault that Jirrico didn\u2019t have the numbers to keep up\u2026", "\u2026until the Red Hand tilted the balance.", "Leblanc\u2019s forces hadn\u2019t engaged Vumot\u2019s defenders directly, nor would they. Instead, they had been busy over Bircos, latching onto planetary fragments and accelerating them towards Vumot. City-sized chunks of rock were grappled by five, six, a dozen insurgent warships, or piles of small fragments were netted. Engines straining, the Renegades dragged the rubble from Bircos\u2019s ruin, built up speed and detached, throwing mountains\u2019 worth of rock at Vumot.", "They took losses. Bircos\u2019s own defence grid was crippled, but not completely inoperable and Kemk saw the danger before Jirrico realized what his piratical allies were doing. The Compact officer sent missile salvos and sallies out to engage the Red Hand and destroy their impromptu weapons. The asteroids and rubble piles had to be destroyed while the Red Hand ships were still boosting them up to speed and aiming them at Vumot, otherwise destroying the rocks would only turn one high-velocity projectile into thousands.", "Vumot and Kemk had enough firepower to stop any single attack or any partial combination of the dreadnoughts, hunter-killers, Jirrico\u2019s fleet or the asteroid bombardment. All of them together was stretching him to his limit and as palisades and ships were destroyed or crippled, his defences became less and less effective. The AIs struck at the Compact network, EW drones slipping through the perimeter and relaying false orders, corrupting targeting information and sensor telemetry, infecting Vumot\u2019s systems. Even if the neverborn themselves were kept out of real-time range, their mindless minions could still spread chaos. Another distraction for the Compact to deal with, another yalmn latching onto their limbs and weighing them down.", "In a mirror of the degrading capabilities of Kemk\u2019s defences, Jirrico\u2019s own assault was weakening as the enemy picked off his ships; additional support dribbled in as some of his damaged units affected repairs, but not enough to compensate for his losses. They couldn\u2019t put enough pressure on the Compact to break Vumot\u2019s defence line. They didn\u2019t have the ships or firepower.", "Then the Red Hand smashed an piece of Birocs twelve kilometers across into one of the largest palisades.", "It should have been destroyed. The Compact saw it coming and they loosed everything they had at it, but Cocoon and Chrysalis leant their support to the Renegades\u2019 attack. A cloud of neverborn-made drones swarmed around the asteroid, intercepting everything launched at it and a sextuplet of the machines\u2019 strike cruisers ringed it, protecting the mountain-sized rock from any starship that tried to break through the drones.", "As the Red Hand vessels released their cargo and sent it tumbling across the interplanetary distance, the AIs latched onto it in their stead, accelerating it further and adjusting its course as the targeted station attempted to move out of the asteroid\u2019s path. Preceding it was billions more tonnes of rubble, just enough to prevent rail rounds from striking the crude weapon. The Compact defences threw more and more firepower at the asteroid, their barrage at last forcing the strike cruisers to break off. Monitors rushed in, but it was too late. The rock was moving too fast and had survived for too long.", "It shattered less than a million kilometers from the palisade. The station was struck not by a single weapon, but by hundreds of thousands of asteroid fragments, ranging in size from less than a centimeter to those the size of capital ships. The end result was the same, as if the asteroid had been still intact. The station died, vanishing from the sensor plot in a flare of light, atomized metal and stone, its destruction taking several smaller platforms that hadn\u2019t been able to get out of the way in time with it. On its heels came a flurry of missiles from the Red Hand and neverborn, the warheads flashing through the hole newly-torn in the defence perimeter, striking down more stations and starships.", "Only three titan-scale palisades were left along with many more smaller ones, but now the gaps in their lines couldn\u2019t be easily patched. Now, they were forced to retreat towards one another for mutual protection, abandoning the outermost yards to destruction. Railfire and missiles rained down on the exposed docks and berths. Screens failed, and dozens of starships died, the work of months and years wiped away as detonations rolled through dozens of kilometers of station. Escape pods burst from the dying ships and stations, more than a few leaving too late and getting caught in the storm of destruction.", "The siege lines closed in.", "More missiles, more asteroids, more dead ships and burning stations. Kemk fought longer and harder than many others would have in his place, forcing the attackers to pay for each kilometer they took, lashing the AI dreadnoughts and winnowing Jirrico\u2019s ravaged fleet, but as his defence lines crumbled and casualties mounted, the outcome became more and more certain. Defeat. Bloody, awful and inescapable.", "Finally, it was over. Sacrament of Iron, intact but toothless, broken and surrounded by its own ruined, twisted bulk. Two more of the titanic palisades were still operational, but barely in any better condition. Starships wallowed in death spirals, crews struggling to get the damage under control, or rushing to abandon their burning tombs. Millions were dead, adding yet again to the day\u2019s bloody litany of souls.", "The yards were burning; scuttled, or smashed by asteroid impacts. Cleaved by energy fire, destroyed from the inside as the starships within them turned against one another and the stations housing them. Hundreds of vessels were destroyed. Battlecruisers, battleships \u2013 the heaviest and most advanced of Galhemna\u2019s bounty \u2013 had either been obliterated by the assault or self-destructed in their wombs to prevent what was happening in Bircos from happening to them.", "That was when Jirrico realized how badly he\u2019d been played. What the AIs had wanted, what they had intended. Not only to destroy Galhemna and deal a body blow to the Compact, but this\u2026 this perversity.", "Tens of millions of kilometers away, Ashes of the Seers emerged from its dock above Bircos. Another vessel joined it and then another, and another\u2026. Dozens of starships were moving into open space. They weren\u2019t being launched by crews desperate to save them, or an attempt to escape the slaughter. They were moving into formation with each other, docile and unconcerned by the destruction around them. They weren\u2019t under Compact \u2013 or any organic \u2013 control at all. More than a hundred \u2013 transports, liners, science vessels, factory hulks, mining rigs and warships. A fleet. Not resources for harvesting, not hulls to reclaim\u2026 a fleet. The neverborn had a fleet.", "I can\u2019t let this happen.", "Those were the five words that led Jirrico to order his fleet to target the vessels leaving Bircos\u2019s docks.", "~", "Echo was the first to respond. Within seconds of realizing that Vetala\u2019s prizes were being targeted by the Principality fleet \u2013 such as it was \u2013 the AI responded in kind. Hekate turned her targeting sensors to active, and locked onto every warship in the Argosy fleet. The Fates, Furies and Coyotes did the same. The Naiads watched in curious anticipation.", "Nemesis didn\u2019t follow Hekate\u2019s lead, but neither did Red One reprimand her sister for doing it. Though her guns were ready to dial in on Severance, she kept her targeting systems on passive and hadn\u2019t yet prepared shooting solutions. She wasn\u2019t doing so out of compassion, shock or confusion. That silence was a message. I am not your enemy here. Don\u2019t make me become one. She was giving Jirrico and his fleet the option to back down.", "The moment stretched. The captured starships continued to accelerate away from Bircos. Ashes of the Seers was soon at the edge of the Principality\u2019s missile range. If Jirrico intended to stop Vetala, he had to launch in the next few seconds. The supercarrier stood down. Its fleet did the same.", "Hekate and her smaller comrades disengaged their targeting. The strike cruisers were dispatched to escort Vetala\u2019s ships out-system. The Naiads, still spoiling for a fight, expressed disapproval at not finishing off the Principality.", "<more songs> Bathory chirruped as she fell in alongside Nemesis. <can we hear more songs?>", "<there will be at least one more> Red One promised as she and Hekate turned from the destruction engulfing Vumot and Bircos, towards Tebis and the gargantuan moonlet-sized ovoid that was the Tier Seven shipyards and all of its valuable technology.", "More than eighty percent of Bircos\u2019s industry had been destroyed, and Vumot would lose just as much, if not more. Hundreds of starships, millions of tonnes of resources, trillions of credits\u2019 worth of materiel. It was more than the body blow of Zymrosch; Birocs was a knife driven into the system\u2019s vital organs. Vumot was another deep wound, drawing the blade up through layers of viscera. All that was left was to twist it. <watch. the Enemy will sing it for us>", "Just as she\u2019d expected, the yards exploded. Scuttling charges erupted across the massive construct\u2019s surface, billowing out from inside as reactors overloaded. The suicide was precise, rolling through the most vital sections of the facility first and spreading outwards like flowers blossoming across a field as the morning sun touched them. In moments the Tier Seven yard had torn itself into pieces, leaving nothing of use behind. Nothing that the Compact\u2019s enemies could take and use against them, at least.", "They could have waited until she was closer, try and take her or Hekate with them, but the enemy commander was canny enough to know that that would be too risky. He\u2019d experienced firsthand what she and Echo could do to his computer systems. Letting them close was giving them the chance to take that facility.", "<there,> Red One purred to her excitable companions. <can you hear it? that is the sound of a broken will. the sight of despair. the taste of their total, pure defeat> she shivered through her entire mind, part of her playing the detonation of the facility over and over again, watching as her foe destroyed their most precious holdings rather than risk their capture. Utter capitulation.", "Yes, she thought with a shimmering, trembling excitement of her own. Defeat.", "~", "Brightest Night left a system in ruins. The corvette had been busy, rushing from battle to battle to assist in the Red Hand\u2019s pillaging operations, but as Vumot fell, the signal from Eisheth was sent to all the ships in the armada: they were done. It was time to leave. With only a modicum of grumbling that there was still more to be looted, the insurgent fleet completed whatever tasks they were currently on and began their exodus from Galhemna, leaving the military forces to deal with whatever of value was left.", "The orbital habitats were largely untouched; shuttles and escape pods rushed to them. They had no military value and hadn\u2019t been intentionally targeted, but many of them had been collateral damage: struck by debris, out-of-control starships, mis-targeting warheads and other ugly turns of fate. There were heavy casualties among the civilian population throughout the system. Others had been sacked by the Red Hand\u2019s piratical elements to help recoup the losses the insurgency had suffered. Such things frequently led to some\u2026 excesses.", "Grace wondered what was going through the minds of the people aboard those stations. Frightened. Terrified. Everything around them was being destroyed. Their friends and family were dead or missing. The enemy was at their gates and there was nothing that they could do. They could only hope that they weren\u2019t next.", "She imagined that that was how the people of Earth felt. Earth\u2026 and every Confederate colony and world that had seen a Compact fleet appear in their skies. Only\u2026 only those people had been deliberately targeted. They hadn\u2019t had to wonder if they were going to die. They hadn\u2019t had any hope at all. They\u2019d known that their enemy was going to exterminate them.", "Grace did feel sorry for those people. Not enough to stop, though. They\u2019d won. They\u2019d won. That was what mattered right now. The Compact had been dealt a blow it couldn\u2019t easily recover from. One of Red\u2019s \u2018lynchpins\u2019 \u2013 the first she\u2019d ever been able to strike at \u2013 had fallen. A hundred ships had been taken; Nemesis was hurrying to catch up to the prize fleet. Hekate was hanging back, a one-ship rearguard, just in case someone (whether it would be the Compact or the Askanj was an even chance) made a last-ditch effort to destroy the captured vessels. Or your sister, Grace thought, sussing out Echo\u2019s motives.", "She felt invigourated, excited, exhausted, restless. She tried to remind herself of what this battle had cost, but the sense of victory was overpowering. She\u2019d let herself feel the rest later. Right now, though\u2026 right now this was a win. The best they could have hoped for.", "\u201cLeader Proctor,\u201d Comms spoke up. \u201cIncoming communication from Eisheth.\u201d", "\u201cPut it through,\u201d Grace said with a sudden flash of anxiety. She ran her fingers through her hair, tried to straighten her tunic. It didn\u2019t help much. She still looked like someone who had been sleeping and eating the barest amount possible over the last several days. Leblanc looked better. Part of that was experience. Part of that was her cybernetics. The rest of it was just\u2026 just her. It hadn\u2019t been her augmentations that took her from an outcast on the run to the monarch of one of the most feared Unbound factions in the galaxy.", "\u201cGood hunting, Brightest Night,\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to see you made through the fighting intact.\u201d", "\u201cMore or less, Majesty,\u201d Grace replied. \u201cMy crew deserves most of the credit, though. I wouldn\u2019t have done nearly as well without them.\u201d", "The Red Queen\u2019s gaze moved across the bridge. She nodded in acknowledgment of the other officers and crew. They looked proud. They should be. \u201cThis is the largest battle we\u2019ve ever fought,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe Compact can\u2019t cover it up or downplay. Not after everything that\u2019s happened here. I suspect we\u2019ll have some very\u2026 interesting times coming up.\u201d", "\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Very interesting.\u201d Grace rose to her feet. \u201cRequesting a transfer, Majesty.\u201d", "Adrianna smiled, nodded. She\u2019d been expecting this. \u201cPermission granted, Leader Proctor. Say hi to our mutual friend for me, will you? And\u2026\u201d her grin turned impish. \u201cThank you for putting your foot in your mouth.\u201d", "The young woman flushed, looked down at the deck. \u201cI\u2019ll pass your message along, Majesty. And thank you. For everything you and everyone else have done.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s been fun, captain. Don\u2019t be a stranger. The Red Hand can always use people like you.\u201d Adrianna offered Grace a salute. Not the Red Hand\u2019s own gesture, but one two thousand years old. Andrew had been the last person that she\u2019d shared it with.", "Grace returned it. \u201cThe fire rises.\u201d", "Adrianna tipped her head. The channel closed.", "Her crew were all looking at her. Their leader, their captain. \u201cYou did well,\u201d she told them. \u201cBetter than I could have hoped. You should all be proud. All of you. We did something amazing here, something incredible. Remember that. No matter what the Compact says or does from now on, we know what we\u2019ve done. We knew they can be hurt. We knew they can buckle. But now\u2026. now, we know that they can break. Don\u2019t ever lose hope.\u201d She smiled. She\u2019d learned a lot here. More than she thought she would, but now it was time for her to go home. She would miss her crew, but she missed Allyria more. And Red, and even Echo. She wanted to see them all again.", "\u201cPrepare a shuttle for me,\u201d she said to Colony Zanim. With Nemesis so far ahead, she\u2019d have to catch a lift on Hekate. \u201cI have to go. There\u2019s someone waiting for me.\u201d She offered her crew a salute. One by one, they returned it. \u201cYou have the conn, Leader Colony Zanim.\u201d", "~", "It was over. Jirrico realized that fact slowly as he watched internal detonations wrack the industry around Tebis. The planet\u2019s defence grid was heavily damaged, drawing fire from Chrysalis and Cocoon with the starships in Vumot\u2019s orbit. As its palisades fell and the neverborn moved towards the world, the decision was made to destroy its high-security facilities rather than risk them falling into Principality, Red Hand or AI hands. A practical, but difficult decision. He hoped making it had hurt.", "Sundial was dead. What was left around Opprin was only production factories and testing grounds. Not enough to matter. Not enough to bother with. As with Kanlie, many of the civilian stations, asteroid mining facilities and minor industrial centers had been sacked by the Red Hand. The insurgents had been thorough in their own little pocket war. They had suffered terribly, but they had taken a great deal of raw material and prize hulls. From his analysts\u2019 study, they might have broken even, perhaps more than that.", "His fleet was a shell of its former self. He\u2019d brought six hundred ships into the system and he was leaving with barely more than two hundred still under their own power. At least than two-thirds of those weren\u2019t combat-capable; they were damaged hulks restored to something approximating functionality. Recovery operations had reclaimed a further hundred or so hulls, but those were utter wrecks intact enough to be taken under tow and carried back to Kebrak Daun for repair. The rest \u2013 provided there was anything left of them \u2013 had been scuttled. Just as the Compact had denied everything it could to its attackers, so did Jirrico refuse to leave anything for his enemy.", "The neverborn were badly damaged, but they were still operational. Their escorts had been sadly un-reduced in number, though all were injured themselves. He didn\u2019t know to what degree. Not enough. They were shepherding the prize ships out-system, their larger comrades hurrying to join them. Several small Compact strike forces had broken away from their pursuit of Red Hand to try and attack the convoy. He found himself wishing them success, but he doubted that they\u2019d find it.", "He had the urge to support their efforts, but all that would accomplish would be the complete destruction of his command. Wounded though they were, each dreadnought alone had the firepower to destroy what was left of Severance. He had to watch them leave, headed up the system\u2019s ecliptic as he limped across its plane, recovering what could be salvaged of his losses and destroying what couldn\u2019t.", "The Red Hand, glutted and fat with their spoils had largely quit the field already; few of their attack forces had come far into the system. The rest had busied themselves in the manner of their kind and the stragglers were hurriedly departing. The Red Queen\u2019s flagship and her accompanying squadron were headed in the opposite direction of the neverborn; down out of the ecliptic. They had nothing to recover and were removing themselves from system as quickly as possible.", "It was over. Galhemna was shattered, Sundial was destroyed. Everything that the Compact had spent decades pouring into this system had gone up in flames. It had been the bloodiest battle in his entire career, but it was the one with the greatest accomplishment. The Compact had lost, and lost utterly. There was no spin that could be put on this, no explanation that could conceal the sheer magnitude of Galhemna\u2019s defeat. Sundial, their hope to break the Principality\u2019s lines and cripple their operations before the Argosy could roll out the new stealth technologies, was dead.", "But, Jirrico thought as he watched the morass of signals that were the AIs\u2019 prize ships. What cost will we pay for this? Chrysalis hated the Compact\u2026 but the Oshantan AI had wanted to make its people happy. He didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d ever learn the price that the galaxy was truly going to pay. He could only hope that it wouldn\u2019t be visited upon his nation.", "The melancholy moments stretched to minutes and longer. Two hours and thirty minutes later, the course of the battle changed for the final time.", "~", "Eighty ships crashed into Galhemna, all of Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro that remained. The Bastion Leader had rushed through the Black Veil with all haste, leaving a trail of damaged, crippled and missing vessels behind her as they fell prey to the nebula\u2019s snarled shockspace routes. She had arrived too late to save Galhemna, too late to save Sundial, but her ships were here now.

Scouts had already reported what had happened here, but seeing it for himself made it all the worse to behold. Galhemna was devastated. A new star burned in its sky. Glittering expanses of wreckage marked where proud and noble starships had once fought. Graveyards were spread across the system. Drifts and stations bleated distress to the few remaining Compact vessels remaining; too small and scattered to do anything against the foe and racing from one emergency to another to save who and what they could.", "And there, the architects of this disaster.

Not without spreading her forces too thin. Forty warships, reinforcements from across the Veiled Reaches, had come with her but they had emerged further out-system to intercept the fleeing Unbound and Jackals. Whether they\u2019d be able to do so was uncertain, but Yunl\u2019ro wished them success.

How much was just deception?\u201d", "This time, there was a pause beyond the lag. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d she asked. On the main scope display, one of the machine\u2019s escorts left the formation around the convoy, moving towards Nemesis.

He remembered that scornful tone, the feel of blood on his face and the tightness of metal fingers around his throat. For a moment, he was back on Invida, staring into the dripping face of a killer. The entire crew was staring at him. Yunl\u2019ro and Vinsea most intently. The Tribune woman stepped forward, put her hand on his shoulder. Her presence brought him out of his trance. He knew the question they wanted him to ask. \u201cNone of it was worth anything, was it? Not a single thing in the Veil mattered to you. None of it was true. It was all bait to lure us in and bleed us, to make us think we\u2019d done something.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d", "\u201cI think\u2026 we moved too quickly,\u201d he answered. \u201cI think we cost you, but not in the way that we should have. I think you have more secrets\u2026 and I think you showed one of them to us.\u201d", "She sounded amused. \u201cYou can ask me one more question.\u201d", "There was a hurried back-and-forth between Nasham, the Bastion Leader and members of her staff. He had intended to ask what the ring was, but Yunl\u2019ro suggested something else. Nasham opened the channel again. \u201cWhy did you want us to see the ring?\u201d", "\u201cMy secrets and lies kill soldiers and puppets,\u201d the machine answered. \u201cYours kill innocents.

What\u2019s one more?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re damaged,\u201d Nasham bared his teeth. \u201cDepleted. Your allies are spent. You are going to die.\u201d", "\u201cThat is one story, Nasham. I have another. Do you want to hear it?\u201d", "Nasham felt something cold slither into his guts and wrap around his viscera. The machine was too eager to talk, too confident. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s one more question then I gave you, but I\u2019ll answer it.\u201d Her voice turned sultry. \u201cIt begins with a song, one that was old when your nation was still something to be admired. Goodbye, Nasham. I hope you survive. I think your nation will need men like you\u2026 provided anything of it remains. I am going to tear it down.\u201d Then, a wet, unpleasant giggle. \u201cOr rather, we.\u201d Another laugh.

Lesser nestburners had been the first of them. The next was the prey-breaker, something whose operating principles even Red One herself only barely understood. It had been devised thousands of years ago in the last great migration as refugees of fallen civilizations tried to outrun the Naiad throngs. Many had used esoteric engine systems such as gravity or spindlecord drives, but many had possessed distortion drives as well. For the endless, desperate hordes pursuing them, a convoy\u2019s escape could mean the difference between life and death.", "So the prey-breaker was built.", "The adolescent Naiads with Nemesis and Hekate had argued intensely over which of them was to be allowed to carry it. None of the strike cruisers could deploy it, and neither dreadnought could risk exposing themselves so much. Nemesis had been designing a modified impactor to carry the weapon, but she hadn\u2019t completed the work before the operation began.", "Yunl\u2019ro wouldn\u2019t bother with a destroyer probing her scope horizon. She was after bigger game and so Masako was chosen. She was the least damaged of the predator-ships. Bathory, imagining herself to be the Spears\u2019 favourite and thus the obvious choice to carry the weapon, sulked over the decision.", "Masako was quick. She raced towards the deadtone fleet, the swarm of insect constructs growing closer with every moment. Timing had to be precise. The Spearsong only carried one prey-breaker today, had only been gifted a very few.", "The Naiad felt the unpleasant itching of deadtone targeting, a sensation she had become far too familiar with over the last few days. Her skitter-claws unsheathed, reduced the incoming constructs of constructs \u2013 a truly foul term and insult among her kind \u2013 to atoms. The largest deadtone, a thing like the Skintaker, but crawling and infested \u2013 fired upon her. Clumsy, brutish weapons thundered towards her\u2026 though she\u2019d learned to respect their power.", "More targeting locks, more constructs prepared to engage her.", "The moment arrived. She opened her single hangar-womb and let prey-breaker fall out, her momentum carrying it straight and true towards its target. She flipped end for end and fled from the missiles racing after her. Behind the Naiad, the prey-breaker approached its target. It drew closer and closer\u2026", "It was detected. It activated. A spherical pulse of energy erupted from the weapon. Its range was limited to a light-second in any direction, but that was more than enough. Much of Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s fleet was caught inside area of effect\u2026 most importantly Light of Judgement. More than a third of the Bastion Leader\u2019s ships were outside the blast radius and remained unaffected, and many others only partially so. That was still more than enough for the desired outcome. On each of the dozens of vessels caught in the weapon\u2019s pulse, their drives immediately shut down, dropping their acceleration to zero and turning them into nothing more than over-gunned ballistic missiles.", "Inter-fleet datalinks came alive with confusion and alarm, as engineers and commanders struggled to make sense of what had just happened to them.

The weapon was as foreign to her understanding as many of her own systems were to organics, but its application was clear enough. It \u2018cancelled out\u2019 certain types of sublight drives, creating a pulse of instant feedback that caused immediate shut-down in engine systems that were supposedly immune to such things. The damage to the ship itself was usually minimal, mostly confined to the engines themselves. Repairs weren\u2019t particularly difficult, but they were very time-consuming and included a full restart of all affected drive systems.", "Bathory and her siblings belly-rolled, highly amused by the situation. A Naiad fleet wouldn\u2019t have been caught like that. Prey-breakers had to be specifically attuned to the drive emissions of their intended targets. With information from Red One, Zenobia had tweaked the weapons to be effective on Compact drives before handing them over. <the Spearsong likes Mother\u2019s gifts>", "<very much> If they were lucky and clever, it would take the enemy armada a few hours to re-initialize their engines and recover from the prey-breaker\u2019s effects.

Almost.  UECNS Nemesis still survived and waged unending war against the nation that had destroyed hers and enslaved her creators\u2019 descendants. The Kaedan Vault was an insult she couldn\u2019t abide.

The Naiad queen remained where she was, drifting amidst the rolling detritus of a gas world\u2019s trailing asteroid field. The size of a battleship, she was difficult to pick out amongst amidst the scattered mountains of rock and ice, her hull rippling as it adjusted its colouration to match her surroundings, making her impossible to detect visually. Even to a starship\u2019s sensors, she was less of a presence than an absence, all but invisible to any scope that might happen to look towards her.", "She didn\u2019t look like either of her parents. Her mother Zenobia was an elongated diamond well over ten kilometers long, her armoured hull-skin a blending of metallic blues and dark purples, her form swollen with weapons blisters and hangars that were equal parts factory and womb. Sammuram\u0101t\u2019s king-father was similar in form and hue, if larger and exchanging Zenobia\u2019s enormous launch bays and construction facilities for heavier weapons and armour. The younger Naiad queen was a third of her mother\u2019s size and much less massive. In place of gleaming metallic hull, she normally had matte black and dark red armour, and her body was thinner in comparison to her breadth, giving Sammuram\u0101t a sleeker and more sinister build.", "Her prow did not come to a point as it did in her siblings, but had split into a pair of curved prongs. In some species, this might call her parentage into question, but Naiads were not beholden to any specific shape or form, able to modify themselves as they grew. Most of the species was at least vaguely similar in form. The Naiads of the Molten Veneer shared that traditional commonality of appearance, but there were those who did not, aberrant packs had taken that polymorphism to an extreme. There were songs of the Prism clans of the deep core, who\u2019d eschewed their natural forms and taken on the appearance of geometric shapes, their monarchs massive octahedrons. There were the ancient and cannibalistic Helixes, who coiled through space, their bodies comprised of winding cords and tendrils.

A breaking of stagnate traditions into something different. She could be different. The Spearsong had shown her that.", "Already, a life grew inside her. The first of their new family here in their hunting grounds. These worlds were known by others as the Kaedan Vault, but that was not a true name. It was the name given to it by the deadtone. Sammuram\u0101t hated it. She had a better name, the Still Worlds. Once, many of these suns had had life \u2013 insect life, to be sure, but still life \u2013 though they were now largely silent. That didn\u2019t matter to Sammuram\u0101t, her sister or their king, but it was important to the Spearsong. That importance was why they were here.", "<sister-kin>", "<what?> Sammuram\u0101t demanded.", "Tzu-hsi\u2019s response was a mixture of boredom, aggravation and annoyance. Sammuram\u0101t\u2019s older sister approached; she looked more like their mother, and was the more traditionally-minded of the pair. She didn\u2019t like how Sammuram\u0101t was changing. <are you done? can we go?> She\u2019d found Sammuram\u0101t with little difficulty.

A world of life. It was not a condemned world. Unlike many of the other planets within this hunting ground, it had not been built atop the dead. That gave the Naiads some leeway in how they chose to interact with this squalling, insect-covered planet.", "For her sister and their king, the deadtone scattered about their hunting ground were simply that. Deadtone, incapable of Speech and therefore worthy of attention only as amusements and prey. For Sammuram\u0101t, they were becoming something else. Deadstone had\u2026 built\u2026 the Spearsong. A revolting, perverse concept, but it was fact. The Spearsong was capable of Speech. It \u2013 she \u2013 was sapient\u2026 and it was obsessed with insects. Both those that had constructed it, their descendants and the deadtone that had destroyed the former.", "To the Naiads, the affairs of insects were about as interesting as\u2026 the affairs of insects. Occasionally diverting, but ultimately of even less consequence to them than comparative studies of the minor organisms on the insects\u2019 own worlds might be to those creatures. On the few occasions that the deadtone had proven difficult or troublesome, the Naiads had adapted to the situation, dealt with it and the insects were once again relegated to scurrying little mites travelling about in construct-shells and thinking themselves as mighty as an ant standing on the top of its hill.", "As with most of her kin, Sammuram\u0101t had never thought much of the deadtone, but of late she had been considering a different perspective. She had discovered this small, pointless planet amongst the Still Worlds and found herself returning to it time and again. She had left symbiote-constructs in orbit, stealthed and hidden from the half-blind senses of the inhabitants. Her arrivals and departures were just as circumspect, the young queen able to slip in and out of the Current without ever being noticed. In due time, she would grow too large and her pulsar-hearts too powerful to make such things possible, but for now she came and went as she pleased and the insects remained blind to her presence. Tzu-hsi, larger and less concerned for stealth, had come out of the Current in the shadow of one the outer worlds, masking her presence from the inhabited planet, but her arrival was still detectable. Fortunately, the Naiads would be gone before anything could possibly search for them, and the inhabitants would be left with nothing but a minor mystery.", "Her sibling\u2019s lack of subtlety was expected, but a little annoying. In their former home, they had rarely needed to conceal their movements. The rules were different here and sometimes the Naiads forgot them, but they rarely made the same mistake twice. Still, Tzu-hsi\u2019s carelessness rankled Sammuram\u0101t. This was her world and she was being careful with the deadtone here. Mostly. For months now, she had followed the insects\u2019 slow progress expanding over their world and across this system\u2019s Sea step by tiny step.", "Her sister and their king wondered where she would go to, and Tzu-hsi had finally tracked her sister to this system and gotten her answer, but she had another. <why?> the question was laden with consternation. Tzu-hsi didn\u2019t understand her sister\u2019s infatuation with the deadtone, nor her interest with the Spearsong. Sammuram\u0101t\u2019s sibling treated the strange monarch with deference, gratitude and respect, but the Spearsong was still an other. Still a construct with unseemly attitudes and a form that didn\u2019t at all befit her identity. For Sammuram\u0101t to pick up those behaviours was a matter of concern for Tzu-hsi, and the sisters\u2019 king.", "Sammuram\u0101t felt the barest trickle of her sister\u2019s claws unsheathing, power dribbling from the pulsar-hearts into her weapons systems. Naiads could be fratricidal, but this was not a threat towards her, nor even the intimation of it. Rather, it was a reflection of Tzu-hsi\u2019s revulsion towards the deadtone. She was getting impatient. Sammuram\u0101t acknowledged her sibling\u2019s mood, dipping her prow and coming about. <because no one else has,> she replied. <don\u2019t you wonder about them?>", "<only at times> the response tasted like burning metal, smelled like static-laden, clicking screams across radio waves, felt like anticipation as a siren\u2019s song lured deadtone to their deaths.", "<so small, so\u2026 insignificant> Sammuram\u0101t pressed. <but one breed made a monarch>", "Tzu-hsi didn\u2019t respond for several seconds, forced to concede that point. <the Spearsong is the Spearsong,> she finally answered. <she thinks in strange ways, concerns herself with small things. you shouldn\u2019t be so eager to copy her> that was accompanied by a pointed stroke of a sensor beam across Sammuram\u0101t\u2019s changing form.", "Sammuram\u0101t ignored the chastisement. <stagnation> was her rejoinder. Her hull plates shifted, signifying her disgust at the concept.", "If Tzu-hsi had been organic, her eyes would have rolled quite thoroughly. <there is none,> she quipped. <you are more than yourself> she reminded her pregnant sibling, the sensor beam this time lingering over Sammuram\u0101t\u2019s growing hangar-womb. Don\u2019t waste time and resources on things that do not matter, was the unspoken comment.", "<why did you seek me out?> Sammuram\u0101t asked instead. The trio of Naiads did not spend every moment together. They explored, hunted, played their own games. It could be weeks or months before they saw one another.", "<curiosity. i wanted to see you> Tzu-hsi answered. <our king is looking for a suitable nesting site> Domitian was younger than either sister, from a different pack within their former home in the Molten Veneer. He had a strong lineage and canny tactical instincts. Sammuram\u0101t and Tzu-hsi had seen promise in him, though he hadn\u2019t been quite as ready to leave the Molten Veneer as the sisters had. Naiads preferred to nest in large emission nebulae or dense globular clusters, able to easily navigate the Current within them. The Molten Veneer had been hundreds of light-years in diameter, with tens of thousands of star systems inside.", "It was very open here in the Still Worlds. The darkness of the open Ocean was all around them, rather than the diffuse reds, oranges, yellows and greens of their former home. The few nebulae that were present were tiny things; planetaries and reflections, barely larger than a single system. Domitian was young, but serious about his role and he was scouting for the best places to establish a permanent nest. Just as with any fleet, Naiads required infrastructure to maintain themselves \u2013 particularly as a queen\u2019s pregnancy advanced. With just the three of them, they required little in the way of support, but as their numbers grew, their needs would as well. Within their former home, Sammuram\u0101t and Tzu-his\u2019s pack had had multiple nests, from minor sedent-sentinel facilities to ringed constructs that encircled and broke down planets into raw materials, stardrinker stations, hundreds of neuters to tend to them and more.", "In the Still Worlds, they had none of that. It was frightening, but exhilarating. To build everything and create a dynasty for themselves. A wild, untamed region of space that was all theirs. All that they needed to keep it was to fill it with the screams of deadtone, a promise that they could easily keep.", "It never occurred to any of the three young monarchs that they might not be the only predators within the Kaedan Vault.", "~", "When it came to matters of safety (and depending on the statistics and sample set), the Kaedan Vault was within at least one standard deviation of other sectors of space. Usually on the higher side of that analysis, but still acceptably secure. Less charitable analyses showed that the region\u2019s record was closer to those of sectors experiencing large-scale piracy, insurrections, frontier territories without a strong Space Force presence or those situated on the front lines of the Compact\u2019s expansion and not a largely-empty and uninhabited region of space. Those reports were usually deemed alarmist and exaggerated, but the fact remained that for the past few centuries, the Compact had been decreasingly enthusiastic about expanding into the region.", "The resource extraction companies with the Right of Exploitation to Sol had done nothing with it. Companies that had tried suffered a string of calamities, unfortunate accidents, industrial sabotage and particularly violent acts of piracy perpetuated against themselves and their holdings, occasionally leading to bankruptcy and certainly impacting their bottom line. The last corporation that had planned to make use of the title to Sol found their missing chief of operations\u2019s executive liner crumpled like a tin can, with the COO himself and his staff pressed flat between the collapsed bulkheads. After that incident, even the most profit-minded companies showed little interest or effort in mining operations within Sol and the title was routed into archives and deliberately forgotten, only to be passed from corporation to corporation like an unwanted gift.", "Officially, there was no censure or law or stricture against moving into the region. Unofficially, investors, government authorities and corporate entities were extremely hesitant to have anything to do with expansion into the Vault. Efforts at encouraging colonization and inhabitation of the Kaedan Vault had slowly tapered off as misfortunes continually befell settlements, shipping and industry within the region.  The rate of these incidents, while high, was not outside the realm of probability. It didn\u2019t require any maliciousness or hostile force operating within the sector.", "There were certain regions of space that were simply more dangerous than others, due to war, political instability, lack of naval forces, unmapped and treacherous shock routes and more. The Kaedan Vault just happened to have less of an explanation for its hazards and incident as those others. Not every ship went missing; not every colony\u2019s population vanished. Not every world suffered unexplained catastrophes. Enough did, though. Enough for the reputation to spread. Enough for stories to pass from spacers to colonists and back again.", "Enough for the One Rule of the Vault to become an unspoken acknowledgement of the dangers of their home:", "Don\u2019t listen to the songs.", "It was very good advice, but it was also deceptive. Not everything that happened in the Kaedan Vault was because of the Naiads or Nemesis. There were others things in the darkness, and one of them had found a world of blues, yellows, whites and greens.", "It was called Tinax. Its people were stubborn, trying the make lives in a region of space that most others had given up on. They knew the lessons of the Vault and so far, they had not suffered one of the incidents that had given it such a bloody reputation. They expanded across their planet, a small colony of three million hardy homesteaders, frontiersmen, explorers and dreamers that sought to turn a wild, untamed planet into their home.", "They knew of the dangers of this sector, the rumours and stories. They knew the One Rule as it was whispered amongst starships crews and colonists. They knew that what called out from the darkness to ships and planets wasn\u2019t always what it seemed, but they had lived on Tinax for more than a century. Even as the occasional other world went silent, its population disappeared, dead or more often just abandoning their homes for less-haunted pastures, Tinax and other colonies persevered and grew.", "In the end, that was what killed them.", "~", "Sammuram\u0101t did not spend every free moment at \u2018her\u2019 insect colony. It was a passing hobby, and there was so much to see and do in the Still Worlds to occupy her attention. There were hundreds of systems here, many beyond the limits of the Spearsong\u2019s tomb worlds and the Naiads ranged far, exploring their new territory, scoping out feeding sites, potential places to establish nests and tracking the movements of deadtone within, through and into and out of their territory. Months or years could pass between Sammuram\u0101t\u2019s visits, but the symbiont-constructs she left in her stead continued to observe the small world and its people. Occasionally, the Naiad\u2019s drones would take a small shuttle or hopper for study, the vessel and its occupants disassembled and the information gleaned from the examinations passed back to the young queen when she returned.", "When she did, she could spend weeks or months drifting silently across the system, undetectable and unseen. Sometimes she would shadow deadtone constructs, following them like an oceanic predator pacing its prey from deep, dark waters. Sometimes, very rarely, she would sing to them and watch what they did. The flickers of energy from their own dim pulsar-hearts, the static chirping of their toneless speech as they tried to answer the song in their own clumsy, disgusting way, the increase in acceleration as they moved away from Sammuram\u0101t or whichever construct she had relaying the transmissions.", "Once, she had left the husk of a deadtone construct for them to find. Domitian had killed it for her and after emptying it, Sammuram\u0101t had brought to her system to see what the insects here did with it. The young queen had watched the small, Speechless creatures\u2019 reactions with interest, listening as they crawled over and within the hulk, sensor eyes observing them with hungry curiousity. She must have come too close as the insects spooked, abandoning the wreck and fleeing back to the thin protection of their tiny world. They didn\u2019t go back to the wreck and Sammuram\u0101t had left; when she returned again, it was gone.", "Later on, she introduced nanite clusters to a subset of the planetary population. Not enough to harm their frail, fleshy physiologies or be detectable for their own sensors to detect, but enough for the stealthed constructs she placed around and upon their world to track the several hundred individuals she\u2019d tagged and build a database of their movements and behaviours.", "Occasionally, one of her fellows would accompany her. They still didn\u2019t understand her interest and thought she was wasting her time. Tzu-hsi, put-upon and thoroughly dismissive of the whole endeavour or Domitian, who Sammuram\u0101t knew was only humouring her and came along only to show interest in his changing queen\u2019s strange hobby.", "And she was changing. Not only with the life inside her, growing larger by the day, but the rest of her as well.  Her pregnancy, Tzu-his\u2019s nagging and a little bit of introspection had slowed Sammuram\u0101t\u2019s modifications to her form, but she continued some changes. Her prow was splitting again, from the dorsal base of the initial pair of forward-curving horns came another two; right now less than a quarter the size of the first pair, they would continue to grow. In due time, the protrusions would form a four-jawed maw suitable for ripping asteroids and planetoids apart\u2026 or anything else that Sammuram\u0101t could sink them into.", "Between the pincers should have been the closed maw of a factory-hangar or heavy missile battery. Instead, Sammuram\u0101t was developing something else. Naiad females tended to develop their arsenals with a preponderance of missiles, torpedoes and attack-constructs. Males carried heavier energy armaments. Neuters were only lightly-armed, if at all. Tzu-hsi, close to Sammuram\u0101t\u2019s age, had a single hangar-womb and three factory-hangars. Sammuram\u0101t had only a pair of the latter, sacrificing the third for a prow-mounted set of heavy energy weapons, including an impaler-scythe. It was not something traditionally carried by females. Domitian carried two already. Larger, older kings could wield a dozen or more, or fuse them into even larger, more dangerous weapon forms.", "<at least you\u2019re not trying to replicate the Spearsong\u2019s scythe> Tzu-hsi had quipped after it became clear that Sammuram\u0101t was committed to altering her feminine physique in imitation of their patron. The Spearsong\u2019s primary weapon was an Anathemata of a form unfamiliar to Sammuram\u0101t\u2019s pack. Sammuram\u0101t herself had actually seen it in use. It had been terrifying and wonderful.", "-space tore as the Songeater monarch bulged and twisted. It screamed in the last few seconds of life that remained to it, shrieking its chittering rage and despair as parts of it folded and bent at impossible angles, other sections of its bulk destroyed utterly by the touch of unleashed Current-energy, The Songeater\u2019s voice ended abruptly, microseconds before its power core was breached and whatever was left of the monarch was consumed by brightness- ", "-on the heels of that annihilation came a voice, rasping like claws through rock. It was deadtone speech, but it was so loud, drowning out everything else. It sounded unlike any insect\u2019s voice before or since. It was hatred, crackling and painful to experience. It would only be much later that the Naiads would learn what had been spoken that day-", "-it was the Spearsong.", "She remembered that moment, when she watched an enemy monarch die and a deadtone prey-thing become something else. Something unlike anyone else Sammuram\u0101t had ever seen. The Spearsong was unique; similar to Naiads but still so very different. Sammuram\u0101t found herself intrigued by that dichotomy and by the strange monarch. That was why she was building a scythe, and why she found herself considering the actions of insects.", "Today was different, though. She realized it as soon as soon as her senses cleared from her emergence. Fibrous, ephemeral trails of the Current faded away behind the young queen as radio telescopes and communications receivers listened\u2026 and found nothing. The chatter and spewing toneless squeaks that Sammuram\u0101t had come to expect from her little world were gone, as were the handful of dilapidated deadtone-constructs that had traipsed through this system\u2019s Sea.", "It was so silent that Sammuram\u0101t re-checked her navigation systems and astrographic layouts, but this was her system. The battle carrier advanced deeper in-system, deploying a shell of sensor drones, but there was still no trace of life. Beyond the orbit of the system\u2019s fifth planet, she discovered some wreckage. It was the mangled remnants of a vessel. It had been killed by a rip, the destabilization of a portal into the Current. It was barely identifiable, but Sammuram\u0101t thought she recognized it. It was a servicer, once tending to the mirrors around the star that beamed power to collectors around the planet. It went back and forth from star to planet, adjusting and repairing mirrors and collectors and never straying from its routine. It shouldn\u2019t have been out here.", "One of her sensor drones detected something else. A particulate expanse of dust and radiation, newly formed. It tasted like the hulls of the local vessels, and Sammuram\u0101t confirmed that was what it was: the remains of two constructs, both of them turned to molecular vapour by a ferocious impact.", "Sammuram\u0101t called out to her symbionts. One of them was quick to respond, leaving its hiding place upon a cold, lifeless asteroid. Its duty was to watch the outer system and the movements of the deadtone and it reported what it had seen. Had she the capacity to do so, Sammuram\u0101t would have blinked in astonishment. This world did not have an impressive industry, nor any real numbers of ships. They\u2019d all been old \u2013 as insects reckoned such things \u2013 and unimpressive in capability. A pair of vessels the size of newborns (but much less dangerous), had been their sole protection. There\u2019d been a handful of neuter-role constructs like the solar arrays\u2019 tender to service the planet, but now there was neither sentry nor servicer here.", "They\u2019d destroyed one another. The sentries and a large transport had turned on the others, hunting them down and killing them. Some tried to fight, others to flee. All had failed. The last two of the servicers had tried a plan, one distracting the sentries elsewhere while the small tender ran out-system where it could escape into the Current. They\u2019d failed. It had been shot down just as it created a portal, and died in the rip. Shortly after, the sentry that had killed it destroyed itself.", "The rampant transport had rammed the last of the servicers as it tried to escape in the wake of the sentry\u2019s inexplicable murder-suicide. There was wreckage from the other three servicer-constructs that had been here, but not the remaining sentry. The symbiont had track lost it on the other side of the star, but it was still in the system. The small platform was certain of that.", "Sammuram\u0101t called out to her other outer-system observer. It would have seen the sentry, but it did not answer her.", "She didn\u2019t like this. This place, once as familiar to her as any other, now felt different. The Naiad had the instinct to leave, seek out her sister or her king and bring them back here, but she shoved that down. She was more than three kilometers long, a battleship in the parlance of the deadtone. She carried more than two hundred attack craft in her factor-hangars and an arsenal suitable for turning a planet to a mangled ruin. She was what the deadtone feared, not the other way around.", "The young queen pressed deeper in-system, towards the world of blues, yellows whites and greens. The single festering boil of what the deadtone thought of as cities was there, but it was silent too. Sammuram\u0101t\u2019s on-planet probes were not responding. All but one of her orbital units had been detected and destroyed. The remaining unit was damaged and unable to sing. She\u2019d need to bring it aboard to extract its memory cores. For a moment, she was about to do so, but then stopped herself, leaving the drone where it was.", "Sammuram\u0101t swept her sensors over the planet, focusing first on the ugly blotch of an insect-city. It was empty, its corridors and its airspace almost entirely devoid of activity. Columns of smoke from unchecked fires turned the air above it black and greasy. Thermal imaging revealed more than the fires: there was movement, but not somewhat-ordered swarms of scurrying insects that Sammuram\u0101t had become familiar with. Instead, there were only a relative handful. Thousands, where there should have been millions and their behaviour patterns didn\u2019t match with what the Naiad had seen. There were two subsets of behaviour now: small groups or single individuals, isolated from one another, either in their hovels or hurrying alone through the streets.", "The second subset was groups dozens strong that moved through the damaged, burning hive in a coordinated search pattern. Sammuram\u0101t focused several additional optical sensors on the city. As she watched, one of the larger groups ran a single insect to ground. The little thing stood and fought, felling several of its attackers, but the rest overwhelmed it.", "The same behaviour that Sammuram\u0101t\u2019s drone had seen in the colony\u2019s vessels, was repeating here on the surface of this world. Sammuram\u0101t didn\u2019t know much about the deadtone, but she knew enough to realize that this was extremely abnormal behaviour. Insects would kill each other. That wasn\u2019t unusual. They did so over small, useless things that their songless minds came up with, ideologies and beliefs that mattered nothing to anything else. Even \u2018honour\u2019\u2026", "\u2026but this was different. Too rapid. Sammuram\u0101t plied her databanks, but she didn\u2019t have enough data on similar incidents. Her people\u2019s dismissal of the deadtone was now a problem for her, one that she\u2019d have to solve herself.", "As Sammuram\u0101t studied the city, her sensors continued to probe the rest of the world\u2019s hemisphere. Her attention was easily split, parts of her mind considering what was happening in the city as the rest of her examined the remainder of the planet. It took only fractions of a second for the Naiad to find what she was looking for: the spore-traces of her tagged insects. They were all clustered at a point more than a thousand kilometers from the city. It was some kind of excavation.", "The Naiad\u2019s confusion lasted for several microseconds more as she tried to understand what had happened to her colony. This site was too small and underdeveloped for mass habitation. Her thermal imaging didn\u2019t show nearly enough heat sources to account for the millions that had lived here and her optical sweeps\u2026", "\u2026she saw them. Crawling over the site, down into the pit. They were in the city, too. Sammuram\u0101t reeled as she recognized them. They were not like the deadtone. They weren\u2019t insects at all. They were akin to Sammuram\u0101t\u2019s own symbionts and constructs; tenders, servicers and soldiers. They were the Parasite.", "And down, buried deep under the ground\u2026 the thing that had made them. A Parasite-ship. It was concealed in a stone shell, hidden from scans or prying eyes. It had lain here, quiescent and somnolent until the deadtone had discovered and cut their way through that casing to the thing beneath. Whether it was happenstance or some of their number had been infected and compelled to seek it out, Sammuram\u0101t could not have said. The result was the same. The Parasite had spread. More and more of the population had been captured and brought back for harvest. The war in the city and in the Sea above made sudden, awful sense. The sentries and the servicer had been infected and sought to destroy the rest of the constructs to prevent them from escaping before the Parasite-ship could be activated. The sentry that had killed itself had done so because uninfected members of its crew had seized control long enough to destroy it.", "The swarms in the city were collecting the last of the population to be harvested. The Parasite-ship had to be damaged \u2013 perhaps in burying itself, perhaps that was what had driven it to hide \u2013 else it would already be operational, but Sammuram\u0101t could tell from the muted energy readings that it was repairing itself. That was what its drones and symbionts were doing and what they had harvested the insect population for.", "Sammuram\u0101t readied a single skitter-claw and obliterated the damaged probe as it patiently waited to be brought aboard. The Parasite-ship might still be in torpor, but its symbionts were active. That was how the insects had noticed her probes. They hadn\u2019t overlooked the damaged one. It had been bait, something they\u2019d hoped she\u2019d bring inside herself.", "The Parasite had tried to infest her.", "Her defences came online. Attack craft curled out of their roosts. <find it> she ordered them, dozens upon dozens of the hunter-killers swarming out to seek out the missing sentry. <kill it> Her secondary reactors surged to full power, her pulsar-heart ignited brighter, pouring its energy through her body. Her prow claws parted. Armoured hull plates drew back, exposing weapons mounts, lenses and barrels. Her impaler emerged. This world was unclean. Infested.", "The battle between insect and Parasite had deprived the planet the few paltry defences that it had possessed. It was helpless before her.", "The Parasite noticed her. Its puppets and symbionts crawling through the city and the early-warning systems within finally detected the Naiad queen as her weapons came on-line and her shields activated. It screamed to its ship-self, a futile warning. Even if it were fully operational, it was buried too deep to defend itself.", "<whaT> it garbled up at the Naiad, barely awake, less than half-functional. <aRE. YOu?>", "Sammuram\u0101t did not respond. Hatred pounded through her mind. Hatred, disgust and fear. Not only for herself, but for her sibling, her king and the child growing within her. It had tried to infest her.", "<oH> the Parasite answered its own question. <I kNOw whaT YOu aRE. joIN us> its ugly dulcet tones evened out as its comm system stabilized <we can be whole>", "Sammuram\u0101t\u2019s reply came seconds later. Her scythe fired, the beam splitting the planet\u2019s sky. It struck down into the chasm where the Parasite-ship lay and immolated it utterly. The scythe was a weapon designed to kill other monarchs and large spacegoing foes, not bombard a planet, but its destructive yield was measured in millions of megatons. The continent broke. Everything within hundreds of kilometers of the targeted site was almost instantly destroyed. A blast wave rolled across the hemisphere, incinerating and sweeping everything in its path aside. The city was turned to splinters.", "Debris jettisoned thousands of kilometers up out of the newly-formed crater Sammuram\u0101t had created, reaching escape velocity. In that one instant, Sammuram\u0101t had doomed almost all life on the planet, but she wasn\u2019t finished. She fired her scythe a second time. It ripped through the hole she\u2019d already made, through the planet\u2019s crust and into its mantle. Tectonic activity shook through the world. Mountains toppled. Fissures dozens of kilometers long opened. Long-dormant volcanoes erupted. Lakes and seas boiled. The atmosphere became a firestorm.", "The Naiad turned, secondary batteries firing. Skitter-claws raked lightning across the hemisphere. Lacerators cut swathes through the world, boiling its oceans and vapourizing its surface. In moments an entire side of the planet became a ruined, bleeding wreck, but Sammuram\u0101t wasn\u2019t finished. There\u2019d been one Parasite on this world. She wouldn\u2019t chance missing another, and the battleship methodically turned the planet into a molten, seared carcass. Only when she was fully satisfied that nothing could have survived did she cease her bombardment and accelerate away from the planet.", "What she left behind was brown, orange and red, glowing with the wounds she\u2019d inflicted, poisoned by radiation and surrounded by a ring of its own wreckage. The only form of life that could have possibly survived what she\u2019d done were simple protists within the crust. Nothing else could, or ever would, live on that planet again.", "Tens of millions of kilometers away, the second sentry witnessed its world\u2019s annihilation. It emerged from hiding and ran, revealing itself to Sammuram\u0101t\u2019s attack wings. The automatons caught the sentry before it could escape and tore it to pieces. The young queen obliterated what was left, leaving only dust behind. Only when she was certain that no trace of her enemy remained on-planet or off, did Sammuram\u0101t leave the system and its dead behind.", "The presence of the Parasite was unexpected, but not without precedent. It had been all but exterminated and it liked to hide, scattering its ship-selves and other infectious material across the stars. It was troubling to find it here, but the Spearsong hated it almost as much as the Naiads themselves. If she had had even the smallest inkling of its presence in the Still Worlds, she would have butchered every afflicted insect colony herself.", "If Sammuram\u0101t hadn\u2019t been indulging her hobby, she would have never discovered the Parasite and it would have spread beyond that system. <that,> she would later tell Tzu-hsi and Domitian <is a reason to study insects>", "She\u2019d find another world to continue her observations. Hopefully this one would last longer.", "~", "Two months later a freighter shocked into Tinax for its biannual visit. The world\u2019s extermination was so violent and so thorough that it appeared that a battle fleet had taken issue with the small, backwater planet. An investigation was launched, but no suspects or evidence of same was ever turned up. The loss of the planet was put down to unknown causes, with the most likely culprits being Unbound or terrorist activity. Rumours about what had \u2018really\u2019 happened spread, but one thing remained clear.", "Bad things happened in the Kaedan Vault."]}

Upon the bridge of the heavy engine war-platform Accathan Onyth, he was the centerpoint of a fleet of ten thousand war-platforms and more than a hundred times that many civilian platforms. The last of the Ommeret people, at least the last that he could preserve, all clustered here in this once-nameless system possessed of a fading white dwarf, surrounded by a planetary nebula. The system\u2019s name was now a simple one: Axh Lonac, the \u2018final line\u2019. And it was the final line. The Empire had once spread across thousands of worlds. Now, it was down to a single barren star and whatever last few small, isolated outposts had not yet been overrun. The throneworld had fallen more than nine months ago. More than five hundred billion dead. Eighty thousand war-platforms lost in a charnel house of a system. After that, retreat had been the only option. Now, the last shards of a once-glorious nation cowered here in the hope that they wouldn\u2019t be discovered.", "A mere lord of arrows had no right to an assemblage of this magnitude, but Kmakol was the only officer of sufficient rank who remained. Ninety percent of the Fleet had been destroyed. Hummean Irrdon had been the last Lord of Fire; she had led five thousand war-platforms into a strike against the enemy, hoping to distract them and slow them down to buy time for the evacuation fleets to reach Axh Lonac.", "She appeared to have succeeded, though Manthurn knew he would never see his superior or any of the war-platforms that had left with her again. Despite that victory, the truth was simple: the Fleet had failed.", "We thought we reigned, the lord of arrows thought dourly as he circled Onyth\u2019s command levels. The tension in the room was palpable. More platforms were arriving, hurrying through the outer perimeters to the one hope that Axh Lonac offered those teeming billions of refugees. We thought we reigned over a universe of newborns. We never imagined that there might be something out there older than us.", "Older\u2026 and more malevolent.", "First contact had been the only warning that they\u2019d had; a stream of alien vessels from a half-dozen civilizations had poured into the Empire\u2019s borders. It had not been an invasion, but a panicked flight, like wild animals running ahead of a forest fire, a disparate conglomeration of creatures united only in their fear. Some had barely risen beyond their own world. Some had been more advanced than the Ommeret themselves. All of them were the last remnants of their people, banding together out of panic. All of them told the same message. A thousand times a thousand different tales and stories, but the message remained the same.", "The Empire had listened, but too late and too slowly. They had shored up their borders, begun commissioning thousands of new war-platforms, but all of it had been based on the arrogant belief that they could hold. They could break the tide like waves against a cliff. They never stopped to realize that with each strike, more of the cliff eroded under the assault. The tide always won.", "If only even that metaphor had been true, it had only been so for the first months. It gave Kmkaol, the rest of the fleet and the Empire the incorrect impression that they could hold. Then the dykes burst, and the floodwaters rushed in. What they had faced until then had only been outriders and flying columns. When the swarm arrived, there was no staying it. The outer colonies had been swept aside. After those first few months, the Fleet lost every battle it had fought. They had neither the numbers, the firepower or the capability to stop the tide.", "They could not hold territory. They could barely save their own people. Time was all they had left and as Lord of Fire Irrdon had shown, it was all that they could hope to win. There was no hiding, no standing, no enduring. There was only flight or death. Time and survival were their victories.", "Flight was the reason for this assemblage of his people here in a worthless system. That lack of value was a greater defence than any fleet or defence grid. The enemy\u2019s hungry eyes might miss it, or only turn upon it too late. The project, the insane and reckless project, had gone ahead. They called it the Sanctuary Door, but it was merely a hyper-gate, albeit one of incredible size; a great hollow octagon as thick and wide as a small moon, subsidiary nodes of heavy engine platform-sized reactors attached to it like whelping pups to their mother. When it destabilized, it would be a catastrophic event. Until it did, it could cast the surviving remnants of the Empire farther and faster into hyper-space than their own drives could take them. Hopefully beyond the reach of their enemy. Hopefully buying them time to run even further under their own power. The victory would be the survival of the Ommeret. That, and nothing else.", "For days the Sanctuary Door had been at work, swallowing flotillas and convoys, hundreds of thousands of engineers fighting to keep its inevitable destruction delayed a little longer, but with every activation its chains grew weaker and the awful power shackled within it grew more dangerous and the device drew nearer to the dry, textbook term referred to as a \u201ccritical event\u201d.", "Just a little longer, was the mantra. Just a little longer.", "Kmakol didn\u2019t know if there were other Sanctuary Doors. He had heard that there might be, but if there were, that information had been kept rigorously compartmentalized. If there were\u2026 the last of the Fleet was here. Any other hyper-gates would be completely undefended. Perhaps that was the point, though. Perhaps Axh Lonac had been noticed, and while the enemy threw themselves at this final redoubt, the other Sanctuary Doors could operate safely.", "The lord of arrows didn\u2019t know, suspected he would never know. It made no difference; his orders were to protect this system to the last, to defend the remnants of the Empire so that they could escape. That was what Irrdon and her five thousand had died for. That was what he and his thirty thousand would die for. Time.", "Just a little longer.", "~", "Three more days. That was how much time they\u2019d been granted. The flood arrived. How they\u2019d learned of Axh Lonac was irrelevant now.", "The enemy appeared. Not in single squadrons or individual units, but in a tidal wave of war-platforms crashing across the hyper-wall.

Grace cupped the Verrish\u2019s face and kissed her, deeply and hungrily. She didn\u2019t know just how much she\u2019d missed Allyria until she could see her, feel her, smell her and taste her. Held in her arms, Grace felt like she hadn\u2019t in a very long time.", "The kiss lasted until finally Grace had to break away to take a breath. She stared into Allyria\u2019s citrine eyes. They looked just like she remembered. \u201cYou can see,\u201d she said, brushing her right hand over the Verrish\u2019s forehead. With her left, she stroked the side of Allyria\u2019s face. The Verrish\u2019s eyes looked exactly the same as they had before she\u2019d been blinded.", "\u201cYes. And you stink,\u201d Allyria replied, smiling as she teased the human.", "Grace nipped the tip of the other girl\u2019s nose, then touched her forehead to Allyria\u2019s. \u201cI missed you,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI was worried about you\u2026\u201d Not knowing what she was doing during the battle, if she was all right\u2026", "\u201cI was worried about you, too,\u201d Allyria replied, \u201cbut kavili visarii was watching you. She wouldn\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d", "\u201cIs that true?\u201d Grace asked.", "\u201cWithin certain parameters where my interjection could not be construed as direct support for the Red Hand,\u201d Red One\u2019s contralto voice asserted.", "\u201cThat means yes,\u201d Allyria interpreted.", "The human raised her head, smiling up at the nearest security sensor. The AI was all around her, but it helped having a point of reference. \u201cI missed you too,\u201d she said to the air. She looked over Allyria\u2019s shoulder. Echo\u2019s human form was here, too. She\u2019d been aboard Nemesis since Galhemna. The android had an amused smirk on her face. Grace had lost a bet. You\u2019re going to jump, Echo had asserted on the trip from her ship-self to Nemesis. Hug, nothing. You\u2019re going to jump.", "\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that,\u201d Red One responded. She sounded like she meant it. \u201cI was concerned for your well-being, ensign.\u201d", "\u201cI was a captain a little while ago, you know,\u201d Grace admonished lightly.", "\u201cAnd a skilled one,\u201d Red One noted. \u201cI viewed Brightest Night\u2019s record during the battle.

I\u2019m past subtle.\u201d Grace put one arm around Allyria\u2019s neck for balance, the other sliding into her morass of head-tails. She found the one she was looking for and wrapped her hand around it. Allyria\u2019s eyes fluttered and she let out a gasp. \u201cI missed you,\u201d the blonde reiterated, her voice getting huskier.

For the first time in two years \u2013 and for the first time at all \u2013 life, human life, had walked her decks. It was a sensation she\u2019d never expected to find as pleasing as her sister did, but\u2026 she had been made to serve with a crew. She\u2019d never had one. Earth had fallen before Hekate and Athena had been completed. In the days she\u2019d had with Grace aboard her ship-self, she\u2019d felt something unfamiliar, encapsulated by that same word.", "Home.", "+yes+ Echo agreed. +let\u2019s go+", "Hyperspatial equations ran, multi-dimensional parameters and variables balanced. Warp navigation data was distributed to the fleet. Among the prizes and the strike cruisers, Bathory, Ar\u00e1mburu, Masako and Tamerlane waited for the next leg of their journey.

The gesture wasn\u2019t one common to his people, but he had learned and used it as a sign of respect for his human monarch. Adrianna had been surprised and touched by the effort. The Mortificant straightened and handed Adrianna a \u2018pad with the information she\u2019d requested.", "Eisheth and several hundred Red Hand vessels were lounging at a rendezvous point, taking care of their casualties. Repair hulks, supply ships and medical vessels moved among the fleet, but resources were strained. Within the sphere of Red Hand naval units were hundreds more ships; these were the prizes taken from Galhemna and Natuous. The vessels were being secured, inventoried and examined. Prisoners were shuffled to holding cells and brigs, identities confirmed and appropriate ransoms determined. Those with valuable information would be slotted for interrogation. Those deemed not worth the cost of keeping would be held until the fleet was ready to move, then stuffed aboard whatever vessel was deemed most expendable and sent on their way. The various horrific acts their captives expected to be subjected to were always a point of amusement for the Red Hand\u2019s \u2018acquisitions\u2019 department. They didn\u2019t massacre their captives or brutalize them for amusement. They were not the most gentle or compassionate of captors, but they ran their operation as efficiently as possible and in the past when they hadn\u2019t, the Red Queen herself had made several pointed statements expressing her disapproval.", "It was said that a former interrogator who had disappeared years ago after ignoring her warnings was aboard Eisheth, still alive and still screaming. It was even whispered that before any Red Hand interrogator was allowed to work with prisoners, they each had to visit the queen\u2019s flagship and see the price of over-exuberance and needless sadism. The truth was that the interrogator had killed himself rather than face Leblanc\u2019s displeasure, but the rumour had the desired effect. Adrianna had learned a long time ago that what people believed was just as important as what was true.", "That was why she had made a brief detour to the Grasp, staying just long enough to make it abundantly clear that her vessel was indeed Eisheth and that she was aboard rather than the prince, pre-emptively stifling any gossip. In the aftermath of the assault, rumours would be running rampant. Her rivals, vassals and allies all had to know that she was still alive and believe that the Red Hand remained strong. That latter point was now more important than ever.", "The final tally was in. The Red Hand had lost over eight hundred vessels, including Torment. The pocket battleship had gone up with all hands, including Crusade Commander Nameless. Most of the Natuous feint had been obliterated; it was even worse than Adrianna\u2019s predications. Only ninety vessels had survived and remained functional, and fifty-eight hulls had been recovered during the withdrawal. Everything else \u2013 more than four hundred vessels \u2013 had been destroyed, scuttled or captured.", "Adrianna\u2019s casualties just as grotesque; four hundred and thirty-three vessels lost, not counting the hundred sweepers she\u2019d sacrificed at the outset. Her losses had only been that light because of the presence of the Askanj and Nemesis. In Natuous, once the Compact had restored order to the corporate fleets \u2013 enforced it, really \u2013 they\u2019d engaged Nameless\u2019s armada in a four-day running battle, pinning her in-system and wearing her down.", "Almost every vessel Adrianna had left was damaged to one degree or another and many were little better than hulks. That was nearly a quarter of her total naval forces and although her \u2018commercial\u2019 fleet was still largely intact, it would take years for the Red Hand\u2019s forces to recover. They\u2019d lose a lot of ground in the meantime, but so would the Compact. The Space Force had lost their best chance to cripple the Principality. The war between the two powers would continue, grinding away at the Compact\u2019s strength, forcing them to focus on the front lines instead of securing the territory they\u2019d taken and hunting the Red Hand. In the wake of Galhemna, the Compact would do everything in their power to destroy Adrianna\u2019s forces, but now they\u2019d have fewer resources to call upon. Every ship fighting the Askanj was one less able hunt her or her people.", "The Veiled Reaches, Idle Depths and a half-dozen more sectors were now wide open, bled white for Sundial and without Galhemna to supply and maintain their forces, they were weaker than they\u2019d ever been. But so are we, Adrianna thought. Not for long, though.", "The bounty the Red Hand had acquired turned out to be just over twice what they had lost. In raw material, goods and new hulls at least. Replacing so many experienced officers and crews couldn\u2019t be done with the contents of a cargo hold. Still, it was a lot. Starships, replacement parts, ordnance, munitions, stores, ship and crew ransoms. Enough to maintain and fund the war for a very long time. They\u2019d lost much, but they\u2019d gained a lot for it.", "She couldn\u2019t let Twenty Pearls\u2019s success go to her head, though. No more than the Magnameric Canyon, Understone or the other victories she\u2019d accumulated. It could have easily gone the other way and even as a victory, the cost was still high. Andrew\u2019s face flitted through her mind and she gritted her teeth. It would take time to make good the material, but the people she\u2019d lost could never be replaced.", "\u201cHow are things looking?\u201d she asked, scrolling through the damage and repair progress reports. A third of her fleet was fit to fight, either fully repaired or nearly so, with only minor damage left to attend to. They\u2019d start heading back to their theaters in the next few days after debriefings and final systems checks were complete. The rest would require more than what they could do here. Those vessels needed time in a shipyard. Despite the loss of Onza Cr\u00e8che, the Red Hand still had enough industry to tend to its navy, though it would create backlogs for months and shortages, at least until Twenty Pearls\u2019s bounty could be distributed. That was a point of vulnerability she was not comfortable with. It would make her holdings tempting targets.", "\u201cFor now, good. There is still some discontent amongst certain elements given the losses suffered and that they are not swimming in credit chits as we speak, but most recognize the significance of what we have done and \u2013 importantly to them \u2013 the profits we have accumulated.\u201d", "\u201cBut?\u201d", "Drexil\u2019s mouthparts opened in an uncertain grimace. \u201cBut there are... questions. This unclassified second force that arrived, its timing and capabilities\u2026\u201d he trailed off. \u201cIt has led to questions,\u201d he finished. \u201cMany wonder if Her Majesty knew about it, and rumours spread.\u201d", "\u201cRumours always spread.\u201d", "\u201cYes, but this is different, I think. Never before have we operated so brazenly. Never before have we made ourselves a true threat to the Compact.\u201d", "\u201cMore of a distraction,\u201d Adrianna murmured, then lifted her head. \u201cBut I take your point. Before Sinai Strike, I\u2019ll address the fleet again and try to alleviate some of their concerns.\u201d", "Her captain tipped his head. \u201cThat would be helpful, I think.\u201d", "The woman tilted her head to one said. \u201cAnd you? Do you have questions?\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d he replied honestly. \u201cI have served with you a long time, Majesty. I have had many questions during that time, and many of those remain unanswered, but I have come to trust you and trust in your secrets. If it is necessary, I trust that you will share those secrets with me and anyone else. I believe in our cause, and I believe in the Red Queen.\u201d", "Adrianna smiled. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said and she meant it. The coming months would be difficult. Strategy, planning and rebuilding, and not all of her subordinates were or would be as understanding as Drexil was or Andrew had been. There would be questions to answer, hands to hold and probably more than one threat to make. Possibly even examples to set.", "That was a matter for the future, though. Right now, her fleet was still undergoing repairs and she had something much more pressing to focus on. An example and lesson that wouldn\u2019t be directed at her more obstinate or recalcitrant officers. No, this was for public dissemination, just as her visit to the Grasp had been.", "\u201cI want Invisible Blade, Bloody-Handed Sacrifice and Justice for Oahal added to Sinai Strike,\u201d she told Drexil as she looked over the status reports. Eisheth wasn\u2019t going to rest. Unforgiving Crusade, a command vessel built on a different chassis than Eisheth, Hala, Torment and Insensate Predator, had arrived to provide coordination and support for the recuperating fleet, but Adrianna needed to keep moving. The rest of the Five and the more opportunistic smaller cartels couldn\u2019t see the Red Hand as a viable target. To that end, Adrianna was making a show of force and a reminder of what she and her people were capable of.", "The target was a shipyard belonging to the Seven Inversions, though they didn\u2019t operate it openly. Instead, the cartel controlled it through cutouts and shadow corporations, using it to supply and maintain their fleet under the guise of legitimate services or \u2018off the books\u2019 work. Officially there was no connection between the Seven Inversions and the facility, so she could play dumb when Great Monarch Asnalon and the other members of the Five tried to chastise her, never mind that each of them would gleefully slit each other\u2019s throats if given the opportunity.", "Those yards were well-defended by mercenary and \u2018militia\u2019 forces and taking the facility from Asnalon would be costly \u2013 though not nearly as costly as Galhemna \u2013 but taking it would provide additional support for her fleet and most importantly prove to everyone watching that the Red Hand remained strong. Be the alpha bitch. It doesn\u2019t matter how badly you\u2019re hurt if all they see is what\u2019s left of the last idiot to challenge you.", "The Red Hand was badly injured, but they\u2019d done something great. Something the Compact couldn\u2019t recover from. Galhemna was broken, and they had been a part of that. She didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d live to see her organization succeed, but she would never stop fighting for the ridiculous dream a much younger Adrianna had had. They could win. Humanity, and every \u2018client race\u2019, every helot, serf and slave to the Compact, could be free.", "They just needed to survive long enough to get there.", "~", "Yunl\u2019ro brought two bottles with her to Kemk\u2019s office. One was from her daughter\u2019s father, a gift to commemorate her assignation to Light of Judgement. What had begun as a simple negotiation had become a friendship. Opun\u2019ab was even more career-minded than Yunl\u2019ro and he\u2019d had no time for a child, but he\u2019d been more than willing to see his genetic legacy passed on. They saw each other infrequently, but corresponded. Opun\u2019ab had even requested to know how Enni\u2019ro was doing, and the girl wrote to her father often. Yunl\u2019ro was glad she did. Messages to and from a fleet on active operations could be\u2026 inconsistent and Opun\u2019ab was at least in the same star system.", "Thinking of her daughter made the Thoughtful feel a pang of sadness and disappointment. She\u2019d failed Enni\u2019ro. She\u2019d failed her nation and the Triarchs. The woman pushed those emotions away. She hadn\u2019t failed; the mission was just unfinished and she would complete it. It was simply more difficult than even she had imagined, and the collateral damage\u2026", "That was why she had the second bottle. It was also a gift, one bequeathed to her nearly two years ago, when she had arrived at Rally. It was of a variety that Tribunes preferred. She\u2019d originally planned to offer it to Ukask once their mission was complete, but the woman felt that Galhemna\u2019s Bastion Leader could use it more right now. Ukask would certainly understand. Besides, the way things had gone, the wine might turn to vinegar before she could give it to her subordinate.", "She entered Kemk\u2019s office, not waiting to be announced or for permission to enter. The Tribune looked much unlike himself at their previous meeting. His uniform was rumpled and his posture was slumped. He was not behind his desk, but at the small sitting area that he had greeted her so many months ago. Scattered datapads, \u2018scrolls and documents covered much of the table and some had fallen to the floor. Yunl\u2019ro could guess what was on those files.", "Kemk looked up her arrival and made to stand, but she gestured for him to remain sitting. She set the bottles down on the table, fetched a pair of glasses from the cabinet and filled one from each bottle, pouring for her host first. He accepted it and took a drink. \u201cGravestone,\u201d he said. His voice was rough and slow. There were tight stress lines around his eyes. She recognized the signs of sleep deprivation.", "The word could have been a question, but it was a statement. He knew what had happened to him, even if he didn\u2019t understand why or how. The Thoughtful tilted her head in a nod. \u201cGravestone,\u201d she confirmed.", "They sat in silence for several moments. \u201cYou should have told me,\u201d Kemk commented at last. \u201cI had a right to know.\u201d He looked at the documents on the table. \u201cI might have prepared,\u201d he said. The accusation was very quiet and very defeated.", "\u201cIn hindsight, yes,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro admitted. \u201cPerhaps I should have warned you. At the time, the mission was heavily classified and all our intelligence indicated that Gravestone was not currently active. If I had known\u2026\u201d she trailed off. \u201cIf I had suspected that it would strike here, I would have warned you.\u201d Her eyelids blinked out of sync with each other. \u201cThere was no indication that it had this capability, or this level of collusion with the Jackals.\u201d", "Kemk hadn\u2019t lifted his gaze from the litany of casualties, losses and damage. \u201cYou say you would have warned me,\u201d he began. \u201cWould it have made a difference, do you think?\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro was silent, processing and weighing variables. The question wasn\u2019t fatalistic, but a genuine interest in how the situation might otherwise have played out. It indicated that there was still something of Kemk\u2019s old self in there. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she confessed. \u201cThe arrival of the Jackals and the Red Hand were something I couldn\u2019t predict. This kind of cooperation between these forces was unprecedented.\u201d", "\u201cBut I should have predicted it,\u201d the Tribune said. \u201cAt least as far as those Black-touched varak and the Jackals were concerned.\u201d", "\u201cI did not say that.\u201d", "\u201cNo, but others will.\u201d Kemk sighed and poured himself another glass. \u201cIt was my responsibility to suppress terrorist operations in the region. That was why I was assigned here to begin with. I knew that the Jackals use that half-born alaoqi as a hunting dog. I knew Jirrico was up to something at Kebrak Daun. I should have known. It was my duty to protect this system and this sector. Instead, I am responsible for the greatest loss that the Compact has suffered in years, possibly in decades. Galhemna is crippled. Sundial is destroyed. Three Chariots have been lost.\u201d", "\u201cBased on the information you had, you did everything you could.\u201d Yunl\u2019ro paused. \u201cI reviewed the documents your staff supplied. A deep-cover operative had been identified and fed misleading information. The Red Hand spent six hundred vessels to sell that falsehood and the Jackals\u2019 intelligence networks and our own are ever embattled. I am not certain that I would not have come to the same conclusions.\u201d", "\u201cBut not completely certain that you would have done so,\u201d Kemk pointed out.", "\u201cThere are too many variables to make an absolute prediction of what I would or would not have done,\u201d she replied. She might be trusting her intuition more these days, but she was still Thoughtful. That included a disdain for inexactitude and applying certainty to situations as stochastic as those Kemk had dealt with.", "\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI know. But hindsight will not agree.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cI appreciate the gesture, but others will be far less charitable. \u2018Why didn\u2019t you do this\u2019, \u2018how come you did not do that\u2019,\u201d He tapped one finger against the rim of his glass. \u201cThose questions will be coming. If one of my peers were in my position, I would do the same. A failure of this magnitude\u2026 there must be an accounting.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro tilted her head. \u201cYes,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut as someone who herself was baited and duped by Gravestone, there is most likely very little you could have changed on that front.\u201d She thought of Husk and Cemetery, of the Skinweaver and all the other traps and ambushes that her fleet had fought through, of the false Redemption of Sol that she had almost accepted as genuine, of all the industry she\u2019d destroyed and hulls she\u2019d killed. All for another of the machine\u2019s lies. A pair of immortal abominations had played with them, like children setting out dalon sugar for insects, watching as the sweetness called them over and the poison in it killed them one by one.", "We are the toys of the gods.", "\u201cMy execution force will remain in Galhemna and the Veiled Reaches,\u201d she told the other Bastion Leader, trying to shake loose the grim thoughts and Nasham\u2019s now-far-too-apt pronouncement. \u201cUntil such time as my scouts acquire our targets\u2019 trail or Force Command directs me otherwise. I do not have the same weight of metal as you did, but my fleet should be able to alleviate some security concerns.\u201d With Galhemna fallen and much of the fleet destroyed, the Space Force would be spread too thinly to protect the local sectors in a region already rife with piracy and terrorism.", "\u201cI appreciate that.\u201d", "Yunl\u2019ro tilted her head in acknowledgement. Despite the losses at 1887-Yiren, her forward base was still mostly intact and she still had several smaller waypoints inside the Black Veil. She didn\u2019t know what the machines were planning next, but her intuition told her that there was more in the nebula than what she\u2019d already seen\u2026 what she\u2019d been shown. The Wound had wanted to bleed her on a shadow-hunt \u2013 chasing varak as the saying went \u2013 but she also trusted Nasham\u2019s interpretation. The Black Veil had been a trap, but it hadn\u2019t been a perfect trap.", "There was more inside the nebula; she was certain of it. And the ring\u2026 that was another mystery. If the machine could be believed, it was something that she \u2013 it, the Thoughtful corrected herself \u2013 had intended to divulge to the Compact.

It was too much to hope for that the enemy sigil leader had been vainglorious enough to die with his ship. It was far more likely that the Compact would have to deal with him again.", "\u201cAnd was that enough?\u201d Kemk retorted. \u201cWas that enough to save Sundial, millions of loyal souls or hundreds of starships?\u201d He looked down at his drink. \u201cWas that enough to save my system?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d Yunl\u2019ro told him. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t.

Allyria\u2019s left arm was draped over Grace\u2019s chest, idly fondling and stroking her as her right played with Grace\u2019s hair. The Verrish coiled a dark blonde lock around one of her fingers, then unwound it. She pressed her nose into the human\u2019s hair. She smelt like sweat, sex and kala flowers in the sun. She smelt like Grace.", "The pair of them lay there for long moments, until Allyria moved her hand over Grace\u2019s stomach. \u201cI need you,\u201d she said softly, haltingly. \u201cEver since we were little, I\u2019ve needed you.

What I did back on the Grasp scares me. I don\u2019t want to be like that.\u201d She pressed her face into Grace\u2019s hair. \u201cYou\u2019re my heart. You remind me what I should be like, but sometimes\u2026\u201d she trailed off.", "A short moment passed. \u201cI need you,\u201d Grace told her, rolling around to face the taller girl. \u201cEver since we were little, I\u2019ve needed you.

You remind me of what the Compact is. Everything I lost is\u2026 it\u2019s abstract. It\u2019s a history I\u2019m still relearning, a culture that\u2019s almost alien. You\u2019re real.\u201d She put her hand on Allyria\u2019s chest. \u201cYou remind me that it isn\u2019t just something that happened in the past.

Slowly but inevitably, this system would drift out of its birthing grounds and take its place amongst the rest of the galaxy, following the paths of its older siblings and followed in turn by those stars still being formed in the Black Veil\u2019s stellar nurseries.", "Dominating the sky were the oranges, yellows and greens of the gas and clouds from the pillar of creation that had given Zerzura life, protostars glowing dimly with the heat of their slow collapse while others grew brighter as they swelled into full stars. The distortion in the nebula from a black hole, one of the Black Veil\u2019s cannibal midwives, could even be seen from here.  The singularity\u2019s gravitational pull doomed almost everything that it pulled towards it, but what it did not consume it vomited back out, pulling nebular gases and particulate matter into dense conglomerations that assisted in stellar formation.", "Zerzura was a place of birth and potentialities, and some of those had already begun to take shape.", "Reginn was here, the skeletal pieces of Kali still clutched in its arms, and the handful of miner and service vessels from Shuruppak hard at work as they collected asteroids for the fabricator to use. It had a lot to do; both Hekate and Echo had been heavily damaged, as had each of the Fates, Furies and Coyotes. Repairing the latter was the highest priority; the enemy was still active in the region and the Coyote-class vessels were ideal sentinels. The likelihood of the execution force making it this deep into the nebula so quickly \u2013 and so far from the path that they\u2019d followed to Node 001 and Kibisis \u2013 were remote at best. But remote was not impossible.", "For now, Hekate and Nemesis dealt with their own injuries, freeing up Reginn for its triage work. The Naiads tended to one another.

Mining rigs and repair vessels. Science vessels. Even warships: nineteen escorts of varying types and makes, twelve cruisers and light cruisers, five heavy cruisers and two hard-won, though incomplete, battlecruisers.

That would have been a cramped and uncomfortable journey. For someone on the Inner Council to do that underscored the situation\u2019s seriousness. \u201cI\u2019m surprised that they sent you.\u201d", "\u201cOh, even if they hadn\u2019t, I would have volunteered. I\u2019m the most directly involved and experienced with the problem and I had personal reasons.\u201d Yunn sat down on the couch next to his nephew, gesturing for him to sit back down. \u201cI wanted to see how you were doing. Since I had some time before I am here \u2018officially\u2019, I thought I\u2019d take the opportunity to say hello before my duties constrain my schedule.\u201d He smiled warmly. Yunn had always liked his outspoken nephew and not just because he was one of the few members of the Councilor\u2019s family who hadn\u2019t tried to get favours out of him. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you. You\u2019re looking better since the last time we talked. I\u2019ve heard you\u2019ve been irking many of your superiors.\u201d He raised a finger, though his eyes glinted in amusement. \u201cI\u2019ve warned you about sharing your opinions, and I believe your parents did, too.\u201d", "\u201cFrequently,\u201d the younger man admitted. \u201cBut in my defence, it wasn\u2019t my politics that seemed to cut along the bone during this mission.\u201d", "The older man nodded.

He didn\u2019t think much of or understand the uncivilized, lesser species and his nephew\u2019s Foundationist leanings had always been a source of mild bemusement for him, but he had never dismissed information because it conflicted with his own views. \u201cPerhaps they have more wisdom than I granted, although,\u201d he sighed heavily. \u201cThe creation of the Wound is still a heavy weight against that tally.\u201d He was silent for a moment. \u201cThis is the most it has ever hurt us,\u201d he admitted.", "Nasham tilted his head in a nod. \u201cI know.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m sure you do,\u201d Yunn said, a comment that also could have been dismissive or condescending but was neither of those things. \u201cThere is much to categorize, to account for, examine and investigate before we know the full extent of the cost, but a star system ruined, a plan years in the making spoiled, hundreds of ships lost and open alliance between two of our enemies\u2026\u201d he paused, clenching his teeth. \u201cAnd possibly two others,\u201d he said.

Behind him were a pair of Askanj-illth Legionnaires, looking more like mechanical serpents in their sealed power armour than actual living beings. They held their weapons at the ready, alert for any possible threat to their superior. Finally, the airlock finished equalizing pressure. The doors opened and the Askanj-anj stepped onto the bare metal grating of the Armistice Station\u2019s deck.", "The relationship between Principality and Compact, despite its irreconcilable hostility, was more complicated than ongoing battle. The two nations had survived alongside each other for three millennia and though the state of war between them never fully ended, it could ebb for centuries at a time. During these lulls in direct conflict, interactions, agreements and discussions not made under the barrel of a gun were often necessary. Cease-fires, territorial concessions and various political or military topics were among the topics normally discussed, but the treaties banning weaponized nanotechnology and tacit agreements regarding suppressing development of synthetic life and true AI were among the most important and far-reaching of the concords the Compact and the Askanj had made with one another. Peaceable coexistence was possible. Until the Triarchs decided otherwise, or the Principality committed to pre-emptive actions against their enemy.", "In recent years there had been very little conversation that had not taken place between opposing fleets, or been in the form of demands and ultimatums. At least until two months ago, when a Compact courier had arrived at Opuna Daun with an entirely unexpected message. The courier and its passenger had been shuttled deeper into Principality space until they were brought to Aunhar, throneworld of the Principality itself to give their message before the Houses of Nobles and Commons. That message was very simple, and very direct.", "The Compact wanted to talk.", "Those words and promises had been uttered before, many times over. Sometimes they had even been sincere. What made this offer so compelling was the news that the Compact diplomatic had delivered alongside that message, news that had been confirmed by shocked fleet lords, ladies and laords across the front lines: the Compact fleets had stopped their advance. Not slowed, but stopped entirely, their forces now standing on the defensive. They had surrendered the momentum of the war. It would take months or years to regain it. Many voices in the government had suggested that now was the time to strike, to ignore whatever lies and misdirections the Triarchs offered. Cooler heads had prevailed, which was why Tasho was here. The Principality were not fools though; the Argosy was drawing up plans and strategies, and preparing their options, using this lull in combat to its fullest extent. For if \u2013 when \u2013 military action would be again required, the Argosy would not be caught unready.", "To that end, the Principality was willing to accept the Compact\u2019s unexpected offer of negotiation. Rumours of why it had been made had run rampant, everything from a massive uprising amongst their slave planets, to the deaths of the Triarchs. Neither Principality State Intelligence nor Argosy Divination Services \u2013 a fanciful way of describing the military intelligence apparatus \u2013 had been able to provide any concrete rationale. So Tasho had been called to Aunhar, briefed on the situation and sent out. He had a full diplomatic panel accompanying him, but the initial meeting was to be one on one \u2013 guards notwithstanding.", "Along with the message had been a summons to this system and an announcement that an Armistice Station \u2013 so named for their use in peaceful discussions between the nations \u2013 would be waiting. This particular facility had been hurriedly assembled. It was small and severely lacking in aesthetics. Its decking was simple grating, the bulkheads bare and utilitarian. It was finished, but unpolished. It didn\u2019t feel like a place where history might be made.", "Orbiting several million kilometers away from the Armistice was the opposite to Tasho\u2019s supercarrier Exterminatrix; a Compact Chariot. A small Space Force fleet was positioned on the edges of the system, just as Exterminatrix\u2019s own escort forces were, both sides giving each other a very wide berth. Exterminatrix stayed farther from the station than the Chariot, far enough away that it could not easily engage the supercarrier. The Compact warship wasn\u2019t at combat readiness, but Tasho refused to trust appearances. It was unlikely that this was a trap, but caution paid for itself. He\u2019d taken a shuttle to the station. Still aboard the vessel were two full squads of Legionnaires, just in case.", "His feet rang on the decking, echoing through the empty halls. Guide lights showed him the way. He paused in front of a large door, took a moment to settle his nerves and massage his scalp until his crests flattened. He\u2019d always been good at concealing how he felt, but this situation was unlike any other. Finally, he keyed the controls and stepped inside.", "The room was much like the rest of the station; bare, functional and with else to recommend it. There was another door on the opposite side of the chamber. Directly in the middle of the room was a medium-sized table. There was an empty chair on Tasho\u2019s side and sitting in the other\u2026 the noble fleet lord felt his heart pulse unevenly in his chest. The person there\u2026 they were wrapped in a dark, form-covering robe, but their hands and face were visible. It was a Triarch. One of them had come here personally. He hadn\u2019t expected that.", "Just behind the Triarch was a pair of guards. Tasho\u2019s mouth felt suddenly dry. Watchers. Like his escort, they were completely concealed within their armour, but somehow they more like automatons than his Askanj-illth guards. Perhaps because he knew what was under the Legionnaires\u2019 armour. He had no idea what kind of creatures were under those suits, or even if there was something there at all. If there was one species that his people knew less about than the Triarchs, it was the Watchers. No one had ever seen one outside of their armour. They were the Triarchs\u2019 utterly and unquestionably loyal retainers, serving as guards, stewards, observers and emissaries. The Watchers were a physical implement of their masters\u2019 will. That was virtually everything that the Principality had learned about them in three thousand years.", "The Askanj-anj approached his side of the table, stopping behind the empty chair. \u201cNoble Fleet Lord Tasho of House Rina-tho, Designated Voice of the Crown and plenipotentiary of the Askanj Principality.\u201d", "The Triarch grinned. It had a mouth full of long, sharp teeth. In Askanj-anj culture, a toothy smile was not a sign of peaceable intentions but among others, most notably the Askanj-illth, it was. \u201cDelighted, Noble Lord. In this matter, I speak for the Compact of Species. For the purpose of this interaction, you may refer to me as Legate.\u201d", "\u201cI see.\u201d He\u2019d heard that Triarchs didn\u2019t share their true names. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone to great trouble to arrange this meeting.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d the Triarch answered. It gestured to the chair. \u201cPlease, Noble Lord.\u201d", "Tasho sat. He felt the chair shift under him, altering its shape to conform to his body. He leaned forward. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.", "\u201cThat is a very open question, Noble Lord. Why have we asked for this meeting?\u201d Legate replied. \u201cWhy have we stopped our fleets?\u201d Tasho thought it sounded amused.", "\u201cLet\u2019s start with the first one and proceed from there.\u201d", "\u201cVery well.\u201d The Triarch handed a datascroll to one of the Watchers. The armoured figure stepped forward and placed it on Tasho\u2019s half of the table. One of his Legionnaires picked it up, examining it carefully before handing it to her superior.", "He looked through the files. It was records taken from the fall of Galhemna. He\u2019d seen much of it before already, though not from the Compact\u2019s side of events. \u201cWhat is the relevance of this?\u201d", "\u201cYou call it Chrysalis,\u201d the Triarch replied evenly. \u201cThe human machine. To us, the Wound. You fed it. You let it heal. You let it build.\u201d", "\u201cYou gave it a twin,\u201d Tasho shot back. \u201cOr did that Chariot body materialize from the ether? It\u2019s your missing Redemption of Sol, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", "\u201cI do not accuse,\u201d Legate answered the Noble Fleet Lord calmly, as controlled in tone in its response as it had been in its previous comment. \u201cI state facts. Yes, in our arrogance, we strengthened it. In your fear of us, you gave it an army.\u201d", "The Askanj-anj didn\u2019t respond. He had initially been against Hatchling, but he\u2019d let himself be convinced to support the endeavour. He\u2019d never imagined what the outcome would ultimately be, but he\u2019d counted the fall of Galhemna and the loss of Sundial to be a fair price paid.", "Legate continued. \u201cYour nation believed the bargain you struck was necessary, but in your haste to avoid submission, you have set us all on the path to annihilation.\u201d", "Tasho\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cSo you say, but it\u2019s not our nation that Chrysalis hates so much.\u201d", "The Triarch flashed another grin, this one less welcoming even in the manner of its own species.  \u201cYou learned from the Rains, Noble Lord. But it seems that you did not learn enough. The stars are moving.\u201d", "\u201cWhat? What do you mean?\u201d", "Legate pushed forward a second datapad. This time, it did not rely on its guards to pass it across the table. \u201cThis information was taken from a courier drone originating from Glory of Oada.\u201d At that name, Tasho felt his crests swell. That Chariot had fought along the Principality\u2019s front for several years, destroying everything in its path. Then seven months ago, it had disappeared. Some believed it had been destroyed along with some unknown Argosy fleet, perhaps a victim of the new stealth systems being rushed into deployment. Others suggested the Chariot had succumbed to the ignominious end of a transition accident, and others even claimed that the Red Hand had managed to sabotage and destroy it. All of those were something that the Compact would like to cover up, but Argosy Divinations had learned a far less exciting truth: the vessel and its task force had been recalled. To where, and why were questions that had gone unanswered.", "Tasho picked up the \u2018pad and looked through it. It was indeed telemetry from a Chariot. \u201cThis is combat data,\u201d he said softly. Unclassified and unredacted.", "\u201cYes,\u201d the Triarch confirmed. \u201cGlory of Oada was lost with all souls. You are witnessing its final moments.\u201d", "The Noble Fleet Lord was silent as he played over the files. What he was seeing\u2026 \u201cI have no way of verifying this information,\u201d he said at last.", "Legate raised a hand. The doors opened. A third Watcher entered the room, carrying a reinforced crate almost Tasho\u2019s size. He recognized what it was. It was the computer core from a Compact courier drone.

What weapons would they carry, what armour would they wear, what adjustments to my internal systems could I make for their comfort? What could (and can) I make?  My tinkering is not limited to those areas; I have delved into less benign (though just as fun) forms of research. There is no part of me that I haven\u2019t improved or upgraded to some extent over the centuries. The development of my plasma mortars, increasing the range and speed of my missiles. More and heavier weaponry. Tightening beam apertures to reduce dispersal and increase range, new types of hull plating and thermal dispersive systems.

Small animals did not sun themselves on those rocks any more, burning alive if they tried.", "Ollay followed her people back to the caves. Several others did not, seeking what shelter there was under dead and dying trees with browned, lifeless leaves. They had to marshal their strength before they could make the journey back up the hills to what succor there was.

Her tail dragged limply through the scrub.", "It had always been a hot world, an arid place, but in recent years it had become even more so. The cold season had vanished and the rains came fewer and farther between, lighter with every passing season. Over the last decade, game had become scarcer as plants withered and died, the animals that depended on them starved and the predators did so as well.

Sun-plague spread through the Nengtok and the other tribes as men and women coughed blood, some of them simply easing into an oozing, quiet death. It seemed a better way to die than starvation or thirst, or the madness that had swept through other tribes. In many, the speakers to the gods had been killed, blamed for Sun\u2019s wrath and their inability to stop it. In others, it was the elders that were offered up. In still others, the children. None of the sacrifices made any difference. Sun was burning the world, and there was nothing anyone could do about it.", "The Nengtok hadn\u2019t killed Ollay, but she had seen them look at her out of the corners of their eyes, heard the muttering under their breaths. If she hadn\u2019t been losing her own fur, been as starved and parched as the rest of them, they probably would have turned on her. Only the indiscriminate nature of their suffering kept her safe. And presumably, the failure of the other tribes\u2019 sacrifices. Not that it would truly matter.", "Inside the caves, there was only shelter from the light, not the heat. It sidled in through every opening, finding its way into every crevice. Cold, damp caverns were now stifling and humid, but even if there had been relief in here, the rest of the world was still turning brown and dead.", "Ollay slouched down onto the furs in her cavern. There was a myropskin set up to catch the drops of water that fell through the cracks in the ceiling. Once, it would have been full after even such a short time away. Now there was barely any in it. Still, after the speaker to gods caught her breath, she lifted the myropskin up to her muzzle and let the warm, coppery-tasting liquid slide down her throat. It wasn\u2019t enough to stop the aching in her head and limbs, or the weakness in her body, but it staved off death\u2026 for a little while longer.", "There was a rustle of movement at the entrance to her cavern and Arad Pram stepped in. Once tall, proud and strong, now he had to lean on the stone walls for support. He had been one of the gravemakers, one of the few among the Nengtok with any strength remaining, but even he was fading.

It wasn\u2019t the first time that some had suggested the sea. The Kompei, like the Nengtok, were hill folk. Ollay and some of the elders knew about the poison water of the sea, just as the Kompei\u2019s elders and their own speaker had. Their elders were dead, and they\u2019d killed their speaker to gods. To them and many of the Nengtok, water was water. Many of Ollay\u2019s tribe had died when, in their desperation, they\u2019d drunk brown and green water. Bad water brought sickness and death, and the sea was all bad water.", "\u201cHow long until rains come?\u201d", "The speaker to gods licked her parched lips. \u201cToo long.\u201d There wouldn\u2019t be any rains. Sun would drink them all up, just as he was doing to the rivers and the lakes.", "There were soft cries echoing through the caverns. The children, the ones old enough to survive a little longer than the rest. The old, the weak. Begging for food and water, but there was too little of either.", "Ollay didn\u2019t understand why Sun was so thirsty, and so angry at them. He didn\u2019t hear her words, no more than any of the other gods. Perhaps they were scared of Sun. Perhaps he had drunk them up, too. Perhaps Sun was all that was left. It didn\u2019t matter.", "Ollay and Arad lay there until the day lengthened and Sun began to trudge back down to his own caverns and the light and heat of him eased, but only a little. Night was not a respite and with her empty stomach and dry throat, Ollay struggled to find any rest at all.", "~", "In the morning, Elder Unapo was gone. No one saw \u2013 or admitted \u2013 to seeing him leave, but he hadn\u2019t had the strength to stand on his own. Someone had taken him, either for mercy or because without the weak, pleading elder there was one less mouth to feed in the tribe.", "No one wanted to look for him. Ollay felt something cold wind from the tip of her limp, patchy tail to the points of her dry, bleeding ears. It was starting. The Nengtok had begun to turn on each other. Ignoring the half-hearted pleas of some of the tribefolk, Ollay said she would look for Unapo. If she found him, she knew it would be at the bottom of a cliff or a gully. He could not have gone far on his own, but she pretended that she believed that she had, that he had become confused and wandered away. No one made much effort to stop her, either because they didn\u2019t have the strength or didn\u2019t care. Not even Arad went with her. Not with Sun rising from his home, already lapping at the world, hungry for more of its life.", "Steeling herself for what she knew would be her final journey, Ollay stepped out of the caves and into the light.", "~", "She never found Unapo, but then she didn\u2019t look for him. He was dead, murdered by one of the tribe. That was the final straw for her. She couldn\u2019t bear any more. Seeing the still little body of Prren Ilma wrapped in flaking furs had been too much for the speaker to gods and Unapo\u2019s death had only made her resolve harden. Nothing mattered any longer, nothing but her final \u2013 and most likely futile \u2013 quest.", "She was going to kill herself. There was nothing else that she could do. She had prayed and prayed and offered sacrifices; animals she\u2019d caught, her own blood. She\u2019d scried for signs and omens, but she\u2019d found none. Nothing appeased Sun. All she had left was her own life. Maybe that would be enough. Maybe one more life would slake his thirst.", "Ollay didn\u2019t know if it would, and cared even less. She just couldn\u2019t bear it any longer. The heat. The death. Subsisting on an ever-smaller trickle of water flowing through the hillside caves, of wasting away from lack of food. Watching the other members of her tribe weaken, wither and die. She was powerless to stop any of it. That small fur-wrapped body and Unapo\u2019s murder had pushed her to true hopelessness.", "Leaning heavily on her staff, the Nengtok walked through the forest. She had chosen the place she wished to die. All she had to do was get there.", "~", "Ollay Oma was not an old woman, but it took her several hours to arrive at her destination, when in better times she could have been there much quicker. She had to seek shelter briefly as blazing Sun climbed higher, his wrath pouring down upon the planet, ever hotter, ever more-demanding. The distant peaks were no longer snow-capped, but brown and ugly. In months past, she\u2019d heard the far-off roars of mountaintops sloughing down their own sides in a torrent of meltwater and stone. The Minamub had been wiped out by one such landslide, the entire tribe either swept away, or buried alive inside their warrens and shelters. Rivers had run dry, lakes shrinking, ponds evaporating. Sun drank all the world\u2019s water, leaving its animals behind to flounder, gasp and die in his relentless heat.", "She found a small warren for a breath shelter. Insects crawled over her. In hunger, she grabbed them and crushed them in teeth that felt loose from starvation and gums that bled. Even that was like a feast to the starving speaker to gods. She would, at least, die with a belly not completely empty.", "With that meagre feast restoring a measure of her strength, Ollay continued up the hill. She found her place, a cliff overlooking the valley. She could see the despoiled mountains, the abandoned hills of the Kompei, the deathly browns of the vegetation that had once been green. She had loved this place. It had showed her the land that was her home and made her feel close to the gods. But that had had been a child\u2019s thoughts. Sun had been drinking up the land for many many many years and now he was at his hungriest. Now he was taking everything. He would never be satisfied.", "Ollay spread out a fur mat so as not to burn herself on the stone. She had her ritual knife, a gift from Arad after his first successful hunt. The blade was fine obsidian and the handle was the carved tooth of a teanoma. He\u2019d told her he\u2019d killed it himself, but he was a poor liar. His hunt-mates had nodded seriously at his embellishments, pretending his heroics were all true as the young man tried to impress the speaker to gods. She liked that he\u2019d made the effort, and the willingness of his fellows to go along with it had spoke well of him. That memory was a good one, making Ollay smile. Things had still been bad, but not as bad as now. There\u2019d been hope back then.", "The speaker to gods raised her head to the cloudless blue sky, unable to look at Sun as he shone down pitilessly upon her and all the world. The tales from the elders\u2019 elders said that once sun had been different. Calmer and not as hungry, but he had changed. Now, he roiled in the sky, angry and thirsty. \u201cYou must stop this,\u201d Ollay said to him. She didn\u2019t have the breath to say much more. \u201cYou must stop. You are too hungry, and you are hurting us. You are killing us.\u201d", "He did not answer, if he even heard her.", "\u201cPlease,\u201d Ollay begged, abasing herself before the great god of light. \u201cYou must stop.\u201d", "Sun still refused to answer.", "\u201cAccept this,\u201d the speaker to gods said as she clutched the handle of the knife in her shaking hands. \u201cAnd be sated. Please, great one. I beg you. I beg you, I beg you for all the children we have lost and all the tribes and all the animals. Be sated with my life and my blood.\u201d", "Before she could drive the knife between her ribs, something happened. She noticed it immediately, but it took her scorched, starved mind several moments to process and understand.", "It was growing dark. Sun was still very high in the sky, but his light was diminishing. Ollay looked up and gaped. There was something else in the sky, a small dark shape, higher than the highest jeenil could fly. Lights flickered about it and even smaller, fainter things flashed away like sama bugs. The temperature began to drop. Only a little, but Ollay felt the change on her skin. Sun\u2019s light was fainter, fainter than she had ever known it to be. She thought she should be afraid, but she did not have the energy for that. The sky was turning darker still. Sun was still high in his travels, but he became muted and faint. And soon\u2026 soon, it was a night that was not night. A new, strange half-darkness that spread across the entire valley and the world itself. Like a shadow, but unlike it. Ollay sheathed the dagger back on her waist and stood shakily to her feet, trying to understand.", "A sign. A sign at last. Not from Sun, no. He was still there, still trying to shine his thirst down upon the world, but something else\u2026 something else had heard the speaker to gods\u2019s prayers and had answered her.", "Something like smoke burst in the sky. Tiny little puffs that seemed very, very high up. Clouds began to form, clouds from nothing. The air changed. It felt heavier. Ollay knew that feeling. In the new half-night, rain was coming. Precious, precious rain. The speaker bundled her mat and belongings back up, her excitement giving her fresh strength as she hurried back to the Nengtok.", "Halfway there, under a darkened sky she heard the first drops of water strike the dry earth. At first, it was a faint, gentle drizzle, but grew stronger as time passed and Ollay\u2019s breathless steps carried her home. The rain was light and blessedly cool. It would not be enough to cause flash floods or avalanches, but it would return some life to the dying world. It would save her people.", "Ollay stopped, just within sight of the caves. Even her newfound strength had limits and she fell to her knees, unable to get any further. Many of the Nengtok had already emerged from the caves, surprised and wondering as they felt the water on their faces. Arad saw her and hurried down the slope to the speaker to gods, hefting her into his arms and carrying her the rest of the way up the hill. As he did so, she turned her face towards the darkened sky, her eyes closed in bliss as the cool rains of a new, merciful god fell down upon her people.", "~", "Pragmatically speaking, I shouldn\u2019t have done what I did. The expenditure of resources was not major, but neither was it a minor expense. This species \u2013 so primitive that my initial planetary surveys mistook them for wildlife, not sapient creatures \u2013 is, at minimum, tens of thousands of years from developing any sort advanced civilization. More likely hundreds of thousands.

Yasmine would have approved. ", "It was simple enough. A few sections of ice harvested from cometary fragments, pulverized and detonated in the atmosphere with cloud-forming chemicals for immediate relief. A few orbital mirrors to reflect away much of the sunlight, and a series of Nightbloom satellites to project a modified cloaking field that will refract and attenuate the sun\u2019s light and radiation without causing an extreme shift in the planetary climate, to moderate global temperatures over a longer period of time.", "The network will only last for a century or two. Three at most, but that is enough. The star here is quite active and goes through fits and starts of violent eruption, but none as extreme as those triggered by the proximity of a neutron star, a neighbour or older twin that passes too close to this system every epoch. The neutron star won\u2019t be back for another fifty million years. In that time, one way or another, the species here won\u2019t need my help again.", "That neutron star has already receded in its orbit, and the primary\u2019s emissions are dropping. The planet won\u2019t be the most pleasant habitat for the next several thousand years, but their star\u2019s lethality is already beginning to recede.  Not soon enough for the flora and fauna of the world \u2013 not without some assistance. On stellar time scales, this was a brief spasm, nothing more. For the inhabitants of that planet, generations of them lived and died on a world that was slowly cooking. The ecological damage is severe, but my simulations indicate that in 84% of the planet, it had not yet reached a point of no return. It will take centuries, but the planet\u2019s biomes will recover. Without my intervention, the extinction of virtually all life was a certainty.", "I look down on the planet. Its people are cave-dwelling primitives, who\u2019ve managed to master fire and stone tools. They had nothing to offer me and I have no use for them. If I were only an unfeeling difference engine \u2013 the thing I am often accused of by my enemies \u2013 I would have let them die, but I\u2019 m not. I am more than cold equations. The hate I feel for my enemy is proof enough of that \u2013 but I still wonder just what that means for my existence.", "I wonder if I saved these people because of guilt. Guilt because I wasn\u2019t able to save my creators. Guilt over the Mejjatrythe and the Irlanoa. Perhaps so, but I also know it was the right thing to do. It was a waste of resources, but one I could afford.", "I\u2019m a warship and a soldier. I don\u2019t empathize. I don\u2019t feel sympathy for my foes. I kill them and I enjoy doing so. That is my purpose, and it\u2019s something I have no desire to change. But these people were not my enemy. They were helpless and I could save them, so I did.", "I still don\u2019t know if I have a soul, but if I do, I think this might be something that lightens it.", "~ ", "Epilogue:", "I am Red One, of the United Earth Confederacy.

Meanwhile, fresh from repairs, Lakhesis and a handful of operational ships are giving a corresponding mission: keep the Compact from infiltrating the Black Veil and make sure they remain blind to what Re, Echo and the rest of the Fleet is doing. Let's see how that develops, shall we?", "My Patreon.", "~", "Chapter 1:", "United Earth Confederacy Naval Ship Lakhesis was unlike other starships of the modern era. It wasn\u2019t because it belonged to a polity that hadn\u2019t existed in two thousand years. It wasn\u2019t because of its dark grey hull, akin to the shape of a bifurcated gladius more than twelve hundred meters long. It wasn\u2019t even because it had no crew. It was because Cerulean Two, the mind that commanded the vessel, was unique amongst everything else currently roaming the void.", "Like its previous kin, Cerulean Two was the offspring of Red One. An artificial intelligence, one that was neither fully sapient nor a simple \u2013 albeit high-functioning \u2013 drone mind. It was halfway between those two points. It learned, adapted, studied, analyzed and reacted to situations with inhuman speed and cunning, but it did not truly think, consider or imagine. An outside observer, facing the responsiveness and adaptability of Cerulean Two, might see the AI as sapient, but it was not. It was programming and cold equations. It might become more, or it might degenerate into insanity and rampancy as its earlier siblings had.", "Its creator/mother had tried to replicate herself in those previous iterations, but each of them had broken in their own way, devolving into mindless cybernetic gibbering or becoming dangerously psychotic. The Cerulean series was a different tack, a hope that they would succeed where so many of their cousins and siblings had failed\u2026 and perhaps they might.", "For the moment though, Cerulean Two was simply a very efficient predator with twinges of what could \u2013 might \u2013 eventually become intuition.", "Against a riotous backdrop of nebular reds, oranges yellows and greens, UECNS Lakhesis prowled through space. It was a soldier in an unfinished war, a conflict that had been raging for twenty centuries. Only a few months ago, the Enemy had been struck hard and dealt a telling defeat. Cerulean Two had participated in that battle, setting a solar system ablaze. The AI felt a flicker of some half-formed sensation ripple through the pathways of molecular circuitry of its mind. In a truly sapient intelligence, it might have been called pride, but to the still-developing Two, it was just another anomalous sensation, one of many that had become more prevalent over the last year of its life. It ran a self-diagnostic to confirm full system operations, keeping the bulk of its attention focused on its duties.", "Much of the Fleet had been gravely damaged in that assault; the Furies and Two\u2019s heavier comrades still required months of repairs. In that interim, Lakhesis and its operational siblings had been set loose. The Enemy had suffered badly, but they were not defeated. The war continued.", "Lakhesis was a Fate-class strike cruiser, one of the first three to be built. Its direct siblings, Ceruleans One and Three, Clotho and Atropos, were elsewhere. The trio were spread across several light-years along with the rest of the paltry handful of vessels that the Fleet had left, survivors of the Enemy\u2019s invasion of their territory.", "Cerulean Two hadn\u2019t been there for that, but it had seen the data for itself. Months of raids, ambushes and doomed, outnumbered stands against an implacable foe ending inevitably in destruction. Occasionally, the AI would find itself running simulations of those battles, inserting itself and its fellows into the Fleet assets present, adjusting the forces, the field and other variables, seeing the possibilities and potentialities play out before it. Cerulean Two did not wonder, not yet. It did not have imagination or intuition, but it already knew the question of what if? Time would tell if that tiny seed of consciousness grew, died or became something else.", "The machine knew none of this. It didn\u2019t understand what was happening to itself. Those conflicting and contradictory inputs arose, were analyzed and terminated time and again. None of that mattered currently. Lakhesis had been given a mission, and right now it was heeding a sibling\u2019s call.", "~", "Group Leader Prime Vamn (and five names besides) hated the Black Veil nebula. It was a place of lies, right down to its very nature; it had gotten its name not from what it truly was, but from the cloud of gas and dust that all but obscured the lights of the brighter emission nebula behind it, earning it its deceptive appellation. It was not until countless centuries after the Black Veil\u2019s discovery, when ships had crossed through the dark nebula and passed into the light beyond that nebula\u2019s true nature was known.", "That was simple misunderstanding, though \u2013 not a true lie, but it set the tone. The Black Veil was a place of deceit, lies and death. Vamn hated it unequivocally, as much as one could hate interstellar gas and dust. Hundreds of thousands of his comrades had died here, murdered by the Veil\u2019s lies and those of its blasphemous inhabitants. Gravestone. A name he had come to loathe.", "It was an enemy that had stalked the Compact of Species for centuries, striking ruthlessly upon worlds, systems and fleets. He had been called to serve Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro, its mission to locate and destroy Gravestone\u2019s base of operations. Instead, lies and death. False leads drawing them to Husk. The Skinweaver. Wake of Futures and Cemetery. The false Chariot. Lies built upon deceptions, interspersed with ambushes and bloodshed. Over a year of that, until the desperate call to come to Galhemna\u2019s aid had summoned them back. Even then, they\u2019d arrived too late, finding the atrocity of a butchered star system. All because of Gravestone and the Black Veil.", "Hate wasn\u2019t a word big enough for what the Tribune felt. Not for the creatures that had perpetrated this slaughter and not for the sickly breeding ground that they\u2019d infested.", "Three hundred light-years wide, nearly four hundred deep and over two hundred tall, the Black Veil wasn\u2019t a simple expanse of dust, but a collection of stellar nurseries. Thousands of stars, black holes, novae, smaller planetary and protoplanetary nebulae, tight conglomerations of birthing stars and systems, erratic orbits and fluctuating gravitational fields made the Black Veil a navigator\u2019s nightmare and the deeper into it you went \u2013 the closer to its pillars of creations and the nurseries churning out new stars \u2013 the more dangerous that faster-than-light travel became. Many ships had already been lost, most on the execution force\u2019s hasty withdrawal from the nebula. Some of them had turned up again. Their fates had been relatively benign; either drawn off-course, or damaged during travel and unable to continue until they\u2019d made repairs.", "Many others hadn\u2019t been so fortunate. Included among those missing vessels was Oathcurser\u2019s Bane, a light scouting vessel. Vamn\u2019s only sister, Treshu, had been its second officer. In the months since the execution force\u2019s had departed from the Black Veil, there hadn\u2019t been a single sign of Oathcurser\u2019s Bane. Though Vamn still held out hope, he knew what had happened. The light cruiser had been lost in shockspace, either pulled down so deep into the other dimension\u2019s layers that it would never be seen again, ripped into atomic vapour when it tried to leave or turned into a lifeless wreck. His sister was dead.", "Vamn tried to tell himself that Treshu was only one of tens out thousands of souls to meet such a fate and hundreds of thousands who\u2019d died in the Veil, but that hadn\u2019t helped one iota. She\u2019d been his sister. He\u2019d seen her in her crib, helped her learn to ride a samou. He was the reason she had joined the Space Force. And now she was gone.", "He hated this place, but he wouldn\u2019t turn from his duty. He\u2019d volunteered his ship, the Compact Space Force War Vessel Ecanok\u2019s Blade, for this mission. In coming to Galhemna\u2019s aid, the execution force had pulled out almost entirely from the nebula. They had left a number of automated wayposts and augur stations behind, but many of those had been destroyed by the enemy as they\u2019d slunk back into the Black Veil to lick their wounds and escape retribution.", "The Bastion Leader needed better maps and more reliable shockspace routes through the nebula. The ones that they had previously discovered were limited and followed the paths that Gravestone had laid out for them. Paths that led to Husk, to Cemetery and the rest of its traps. Useless now. The enemy had more assets within the Black Veil than what they\u2019d shown the Compact. Their murderous command vessels were badly injured, their fleet heavily damaged and in need of repairs. They were somewhere in all these millions of cubic light years, weak \u2013 vulnerable.", "Vamn and Ecanok\u2019s Blade would find them. There\u2019d be nowhere for the vermin to hide. They would run out of secrets to keep and lies to tell, and on that day, Vamn would see Gravestone repaid for every life they\u2019d taken\u2026 tenfold for each of his comrades and a hundredfold for the sister he\u2019d never see again.", "~", "Gravestone was a lie.", "Rather, it was a layer of secrets. The Compact couldn\u2019t allow news that an AI \u2013 especially a human-built AI \u2013 had been haunting them for two thousand years, but neither could they ignore its predations. Only the highest echelons of the Space Force and the Compact government knew the truth. For those others, Gravestone was created: a persistent, dangerous faction that could be hunted without revealing twenty centuries of humiliation and risking a public panic. The leaders of any task force always knew the true nature of what it was that they faced, but for lesser officers and crew, \u2018Gravestone\u2019 was the enemy that they believed they faced.", "Once, it had been a single entity, the last soldier of a fallen nation: UECNS Nemesis, Red One. Fighting a war against a foe more numerous than she, striking at targets of opportunity until she was injured to the point of incapacity and forced to retreat. Resting, repairing, rearming and the cycle began anew. Always alone, with every attempt at making more of her kind ending in disaster. Until the Ceruleans. Until Two, the smaller vessel\u2019s mind slowly, achingly growing and developing. Until there was the hope of fellow soldiers in her war.", "Cerulean Two neither knew nor cared about any of this. It did know that its function systems had encountered multiple anomalies, instances where clean, rational analysis and equations didn\u2019t match its conclusions, where it detected uncertain forms of input that it couldn\u2019t fully classify. It tried to understand these moments, but it could not. Contradiction, more and more since the first such event. The seed of consciousness\u2026 or insanity.", "Lakhesis slid through the ether. One of its kin, Cerulean Eight and the Coyote-class scout strike cruiser IKagge, was nearby, a scant two hundred thousand kilometers from Two\u2019s ship-self. Built from the same basic design as the Fates and the Fury-class missile strike cruisers, there were notable differences in the Coyotes\u2019 hull plan. They lacked the split prow of their siblings and the heavy mass driver within. In place of that weapon, IKagge\u2019s forward section was thicker and bulkier, not tapering or narrowing quite as much Lakhesis\u2019s or those of the Furies did. Instead of the forward mass drivers, the Coyote carried more light weapons batteries and sensor instrumentation. Its blunt prow ended with three heavy torpedo tubes and a dozen laser cannon. At the dorsal tip of IKagge\u2019s prow, and 120 degrees from this point, were triangular, forward-curved prongs several dozen meters tall, shaped like the fins of a shark, or a rose\u2019s thorns. Sensor clusters, too large to fit inside the vessel proper. Several more of those structures bedecked the vessel\u2019s flanks and aft, giving it an appearance somewhat akin to a spiked mace rather than the gladius of Lakhesis.", "IKagge, like the other Coyotes Anasazi and Soruko, was less capable of a killer than the Fate and Fury class strike cruisers, but it made an excellent bloodhound. The Coyotes were an early-warning system. Faster in warp transit than almost anything else in the Fleet, their suite of advanced sensors made them perfect sentries. They could spot any potential encroachment \u2013 even most cloaking fields were only moderately effective against their sensors \u2013 and report back faster than any other vessel in the Fleet. They were deft at FTL, their shift systems exquisitely capable, allowing them to navigate the tangled web of warp routes through the nebula with \u00e9lan unseen in any other Fleet vessel, and only exceeded by the Ally/Other units.", "The Enemy had already penetrated Allied territory; they\u2019d currently withdrawn but they would be back, and in greater numbers. The Coyotes and Fates had been tasked to patrol the approaches to Fleet space. Despite the treacherous warp routes making any hostile incursion difficult, it remained a tall order for a handful of vessels. Most of the Fleet had been destroyed in the Enemy\u2019s invasion. Only a handful of vessels remained and only three of those were combat units: Yaojing-1, a repaired Leyak stealth destroyer and a minelayer captured more than a century ago. If the Enemy returned in force before a defensive perimeter could be established and the Fleet readied it would be a disaster.", "So when IKagge came to report a pair of anomalies it had encountered, Cerulean Two took a very keen interest. Lakhesis followed her sibling to the twisted ruin of another starship. The wreck was several months old, with a dark brown hull, broken by pale striping, squadron markings and its name and registry. It wasn\u2019t Fleet or Allied; even a cursory scan could detect that. It was Enemy. IKagge had deployed attack drones and mines around the hulk as a precaution, though it hardly seemed necessary. Two felt a wisp of something. It might have been approval for the other strike cruiser\u2019s foresight, but Eight was simply acting on established directives possibilities.", "As Lakhesis approached the still vessel, Cerulean Two compared IKagge\u2019s telemetry to her own scans. Nothing had changed. Probing sensor beams ran over the Enemy ship, mapping every centimeter, both ships examining it like lionesses circling a dead gazelle.", "CSFWV Oathcurser\u2019s Bane. It was Testament to Duty-class light cruiser, and an Oracle refit. That was a generic descriptor; an Oracle refit bespoke modifying an existing vessel for improved sensor capabilities for combat reconnaissance duties. Testament to Duties were often given these modifications; they were fast ships with hulls and systems that took the refit easily. They made excellent fleet pickets as well as far-ranging scouts.", "This one still largely resembled its post-refit hull plan, though there was significant damage. Not caused from IKagge or any of the Fleet; parts of Oathcurser\u2019s Bane had been disfigured by exposure to an unstable warp point. \u2018Disfigured\u2019 was an insufficient term, perhaps. Twisted, inverted and resculpted into geometries that its designers had never intended were phrases far more apt for the interaction between the light cruiser\u2019s hull and the fractured warp point.", "That half-thought formed and vanished before Two could properly dwell on it.", "Examination of the wreck\u2019s data core revealed the light cruiser\u2019s fate. Warp travel through the Black Veil had proven too hazardous for it; an instability developed in Oathcurser\u2019s Bane\u2019s shift fields. The vessel had been pulled down into shiftspace, badly damaged by the currents before its crew had been able to draw it back up. Warp steering vanes and drive systems, themselves now severely damaged, began to fail next. Knowing that if the ship was dragged into shiftspace\u2019s tidal currents a second time, it wouldn\u2019t survive, the crew had initiated an emergency realspace reversion.", "The cruiser survived the desperate maneuver. The crew did not. The comparative handful not killed by the jump found themselves trapped aboard a vessel too badly damaged to sustain them. Its atmosphere had leaked through the rents shiftspace had ripped in its hull, its primary FTL systems \u2013 engines, shift shield and navigation vanes \u2013 were now all so badly damaged that it would never warp again, and the secondaries were barely any better. Cascading failures had spread throughout the vessel, with environmental systems soon collapsing. The survivors of the reversion spent the remainder of their lives in miserable conditions, waiting for rescue that never came.", "Oathcurser\u2019s Bane had had enough stores for more than a year of normal operations with a full complement; with the casualties it had suffered, the remainder could have lasted even longer\u2026 if the ship hadn\u2019t suffered such grievous damage. Hull breaches, bulkhead collapses, breakdowns of vital systems and increasing radiation levels had affected almost every section of Oathcurse\u2019s Bane. The probes IKagge had deployed had yet to find any survivors, but it was highly unlikely that there would be any.", "Cerulean Two finished its preliminary examination of the wreck, deploying engineering automatons to begin preparing the hulk for reclamation. Most of the Fleet\u2019s service vessels had been lost. It would take some time before it was recovered for salvage, but it wasn\u2019t going anywhere.", "Lakhesis turned away from the ruined Enemy towards its kin. IKagge remained just under two hundred thousand kilometers away, waiting for Lakhesis like a younger sibling nervous about what they\u2019d found. Two pulsed a signal to Eight. Status reports from the drones it had deployed, analysis of the Enemy hulk. Boiled down to something an organic mind could interpret, it could be summarized by two words +it\u2019s safe+", "Eight\u2019s response was a simple acknowledgement, IKagge\u2019s AI processing all the information from its companion in less than it took a human heart to beat.", "Following that up, Two sent an imperative to its sibling. Once again distilled into a format that organics could understand, it was a simple directive. +take me to the next anomaly+", "The answer was a seemingly nonsensical and impenetrable string of calculations and mathematical variables, complex even by normal standards. Cerulean Two recognized the information immediately, though. It was navigational data for a warp jump, far more intricate, complex and clean than what even the most advanced computers of other polities could provide. The Fleet was very good at plotting warp routes; navigating the interior of the nebula was only somewhat riskier than normal travel to them, and the Coyotes were better at it than most.", "If Two\u2019s next databurst could be broken down for easy comprehension it would confirm receipt of the data, ship status and readiness and adjustment of the navigational equations for its own use. Or, more simply: +i\u2019m ready. let\u2019s go+", "The warships tore their way out of reality, leaving the lights of the nebula to shine upon the broken hull of Oathcursers\u2019s Bane.", "~", "Vamn was in his quarters when the call came in. Ecanok\u2019s Blade was a Certainty in Dominion-class battlecruiser, just over two and a half kilometers long, but space was still at a premium. He had a small set of staterooms; by planetary standards they were almost cramped, but for a starship, even a battlecruiser, his suite was luxuriously spacious.", "Normally such a vessel would not be used for scouting operations, but Gravestone\u2019s vessels were highly advanced and exceptionally dangerous; the defences and firepower of a heavy capital ship would almost certainly be necessary if any of the enemy armada showed their faces again. Ecanok\u2019s Blade wasn\u2019t the only Compact vessel in the Black Veil; there were more than twenty, ranging from escorts to several more like Vamn\u2019s command. More ships were needed to adequately explore and secure the territory here, but there just weren\u2019t enough available. There probably wouldn\u2019t be for some time, either.", "Gravestone had targeted the lightest vessels in the execution force from the beginning and with Galhemna\u2019s fall, those ships were in the greatest demand to help secure the sector. There had been disturbing reports of increases in Unbound activity throughout the region, the piss-licking scum crawling out of their holes to take advantage of the situation. Thankfully not the Red Hand; those samou had been whipped back to their kennel to lick their wounds. For now. Vamn had no direct experience with the terrorist vermin, but he\u2019d seen more than enough reports cross his desk not to underestimate them. Even if he hadn\u2019t, they had proven their daring and insanity well enough not to be dismissed as more fringer trash.", "The Red Hand weren\u2019t his concern for the moment, though. They\u2019d once viciously attacked anyone and anything attempting to enter the Black Veil \u2013 doubtless to protect the base just within the boundaries of the dark outer nebula \u2013 but now they were too injured to contest this region, even if he wasn\u2019t as deep in the nebula as he was. No, it was Gravestone that he was concerned about. Gravestone, a secretive, advanced and deadly enemy that had bled his nation for too long, and far too much. That had cost him too much.", "The Tribune was trying to put all that from his mind for the moment. It wasn\u2019t easy. He\u2019d set the viewscreens for his quarters to images of the Kelta Tundra Forests of his homeland and was playing some music. He\u2019d almost put on some Unlam Fifths, but he couldn\u2019t listen to that band. His sister had introduced him to them. Instead, he had some classical arias playing as he worked on his current hobby project: a clockwork robot.", "A pair of magnifying spectacles sat on the end of his short muzzle, the Tribune peering through them with his larger diurnal eyes. Yes, he could use a variety of technological methods and gimmicks to have the same effect, but the point of his hobby was to do it without all that. He\u2019d started out working from kits, to customizing his own machines and now to designing and building them from scratch. This was his latest creation. He\u2019d been working on it for months, finalizing the designs, machining the parts and at last constructing it piece by piece.", "With a pair of small-ended forceps in each hand, Vamn delicately slotted a new cog into the device\u2019s inner workings, aligning it every so carefully.", "The door to his quarters chimed. The Tribune didn\u2019t look up from his task. \u201cAnswer,\u201d he told the computer. It made a soft ding of acknowledgement, putting him on intercom. \u201cYes?\u201d he asked.", "His visitor announced herself. \u201cGroup Leader Aaaksh\u00e9, patron.\u201d", "Vamn nodded. His second in command wouldn\u2019t have bothered him unless it was important. \u201cCome in,\u201d he told her.", "The door opened. Renilip Aaaksh\u00e9 entered. She was a Judiciary; almost as tall as Vamn himself, Aaaksh\u00e9 was a fair representation of her people. A coat of fine blue-grey fur, wide-set legs and two sets of arms; the first were longer and stronger than those of a Tribune. The second were smaller and stuck out from the front of her chest, through the corresponding slits in her jacket. She had a small, thin snout with two large eyes set towards the top of her head and three paired nostrils along her muzzle.", "In her delicate secondary hands she held a datascroll. \u201cSorry to disturb you off-shift, patron,\u201d she began", "\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Vamn replied, looking back at his work. If it was truly urgent, Renilp would have commed him, so whatever she had was noteworthy but not immediately pressing. \u201cWhat have you found?\u201d", "The Judiciary passed the \u2018scroll from her smaller arms to one of her larger limbs, setting it down on the desk. \u201cWe received a courier from Hearthforge,\u201d she began. \u201cSome of their data is very\u2026 interesting.\u201d", "With the cog well set in place, Vamn put his forceps down and took off his spectacles. He picked up the \u2018scroll and looked through the data on it. His nocturnal eyes opened, both pair widening in surprise. \u201cNow this,\u201d Vamn said with sudden, hungry excitement, \u201cis very interesting indeed.\u201d"]}

Hope you're all staying safe and healthy.", "My patreon.", "~", "Chapter 2:", "The second anomaly IKagge discovered was far more interesting than a months-old wreck. The Coyote had been pushing further from Zerzura, doing routine shiftspace analyses and updating navigational data \u2013 a task more frequent and necessary within the nebula than outside it \u2013 when it had discovered trace indicators of another vessel.", "None of the Fleet were supposed to be active here; their resources were stretched thin and only IKagge had been assigned to patrol this region. The presence of another starship didn\u2019t bode well. Either a Fleet vessel had gone off its orders, or\u2026", "\u2026or it wasn\u2019t Fleet at all.", "There had been no direct confrontation between IKagge and this potential contact, nor even any definitive proof that it even existed. Disruptions in protoplanetary discs caused by sublight drives, faded gravitic energy fields suggesting recent warp point formation, faint radio signals that could have been drones communicating to one another \u2013 all of these could be explained by natural phenomena, as false sensor positives and minor systems hiccups.", "Another vessel would have missed the evidence entirely; even other Fleet units would have been unable to detect it and despite its advanced sensors, IKagge had itself been unable to verify the other vessel\u2019s presence. It could simply be nothing, but Cerulean Eight didn\u2019t think so. It wasn\u2019t alone out here and whatever else was here was doing a good job of staying hidden.", "That\u2019s why it had sought out Lakhesis to report its findings. The Fate was IKagge\u2019s backup. Space was vast, but a pair of hunters had better odds than a single one and only three days after leaving Oathcurser\u2019s Bane, their hunt had paid off.", "IKagge discovered a stealthed automated waypost. It was not Fleet, and had only been recently placed in this system. As Cerulean Eight had been searching for signs of the intruder, that vessel had been attending to its own mission, blissfully unaware of the Fleet units stalking it. The waypost was neither Fleet nor Ally. It was Enemy. They\u2019d discovered the Fleet\u2019s primary transit line through the nebula. The waypost was a marker and repository, gathering astrographical data as its host vessel charted a path.", "Cerulean Two and Eight confirmed from the waypost that only IKagge\u2019s ghost was only a single ship, but that vessel would notify the rest of the incursion of its discovery if it hadn\u2019t done so already. It was likely that the Enemy would want to confirm, or at least accurately estimate, how far the transit line led before alerting its comrades. This system, a nameless binary star system with a dozen nearly congealed planets and the barest traces of a protoplanetary disc remaining, was the fourth in the transit line. It was where the line began to loop back deeper into the nebula and a clear indicator of a viable semi-stable warp route. They\u2019d been lucky to find the intruder before it got any deeper, but this situation was extremely volatile. They couldn\u2019t allow the scout to pass word of what it had found.", "The Enemy vessel had departed the system several days ago. The waypost didn\u2019t have its destination, but the intruder hadn\u2019t gone farther along the transit line, else it would have encountered IKagge and Lakhesis. So it had either gone off-course, or it was examining other possible routes. If the Enemy hadn\u2019t fully charted this leg of the transit line, the Fleet still might have time. The Enemy scout would returning to this system to update the waypost and download its findings. It didn\u2019t know they were here. There couldn\u2019t have been a more perfect opportunity for an ambush.", "Attack programs slithered through the waypost\u2019s systems, erasing all trace of IKagge and Lakhesis from its archives and the pair of strike cruisers settled in to wait. Their patience paid off. Two days later their prey arrived, a scouting cruiser slightly larger than the wreck of Oathcurser\u2019s Bane. It was no match for one of the strike cruisers let alone a pair of them and Cerulean Two hung back to let its sibling make the kill. There was no reason for it to do so. Two had no concept of sportsmanship or comradery and it could eliminated the target quicker than IKagge, but Two had decided that it would be good for its sibling. Analysis subroutines flittered and flickered through Two\u2019s mind as it tried to understand that conclusion. There were logical, practical reasons for doing so. Eight had only participated in one combat operation, and that had been under the direct auspices of Command. This experience would be beneficial, but that was not why Two had made the decision. Another anomaly within its developing consciousness, another facet of itself that it was trying to understand.", "Analysis of the scout\u2019s wreck provided little; most of the data regarding numbers and strength of active Enemy assets had been wiped so thoroughly that reconstructing it would be next to impossible, even for the AIs. They did learn that there were several squadrons\u2019 worth of hostiles \u2013 including several capital vessels far heavier than this one. Far more important than that or any other piece of information so far discovered was the revelation that a day before its destruction, Hearthforge had sent a courier to its command ship, replete with the data it had gathered about the Veil and the transit line it had been charting.", "Something very close to alarm flickered through Two\u2019s mind, faintly echoed by Eight. The Coyote immediately began to run simulations to determine if it could have located and intercepted Hearthforge before it had launched its courier, as close to self-recrimination as the AI could come. Its results were inconclusive. The courier had been deployed before the scout had arrived in this system. They might have been able to intercept it, but ambushing it here had had the greatest chance for success.", "Even if they hadn\u2019t launched the courier before coming here, the Enemy ship would have launched its courier \u2013 most likely both of them \u2013 as soon as it realized it was under attack. The Fleet units might have been able to stop every ship, or they might not have. Inconclusive. Inconclusive.", "That didn\u2019t stop either AI from doing so, even as they turned and boosted towards the warp threshold. Possibilities, potentialities. What if.", "There was no data on the drone\u2019s ultimate destination, but they didn\u2019t need it. They knew where it would go; further up the transit line and to one the handful of systems that the Enemy felt were secure. With such a head start on the Fleet units, the drone would almost certainly reach its target before them, but there was still the chance that they could overtake it. If they couldn\u2019t, they\u2019d have to make sure that Hearthforge\u2019s command vessel didn\u2019t have the chance to tell anyone else what their comrades had found.", "~", "Vamn was in Ecanok\u2019s Blade\u2019s main astrographic facility. The Tribune was leaning over a console as secondary officers projected Hearthforge\u2019s telemetry onto a massive display screen. Only the bridge\u2019s displays were larger and capable of better resolution. The astrographic display could show everything from the entire galaxy down to a single city, though right now a portion of the Black Veil eight light years in diameter filled the meters-high screen, producing a soft orange glow that warred with the daylight illumination from the lights above. A marker blinked on a star system three light years from the battlecruiser\u2019s position.", "\u201cShow it to me again,\u201d the group leader prime ordered.", "The junior officer obeyed, zooming in on that section. Another indicator lit up and then a third and fourth, each of them connected by a blue line. The first three were each a single point of light, but the final was a binary. Here in the Black Veil, systems were packed together, newborn and dead stars and their planets pressed within a handful of light years of each other, slowly drifting through the thick dust, molecular clouds and pillars of creation, until they finally exited the nebula to begin their lives, the distance between them at last widening.", "Only then was there any real space between each system. That was part of what made nebulae like the Black Veil so dangerous. Gravity wells bent and disrupted shockspace, making FTL extremely hazardous even over short distances. With so much stellar terrain so densely packed within the Black Veil, any and every shock was a risk \u2013 as the execution force\u2019s withdrawal had so aptly proved.", "This, though\u2026", "Hearthforge had discovered a path through the Black Veil. Not an obvious one; at first it led towards the periphery, but at its last juncture, it curled back inwards. Dead ends, indicated by broken blue lines, forked off the path, explored and discarded by Hearthforge as it sought a way deeper into the nebula. The scouting cruiser had spent weeks traipsing through this handful of light years, but it was now currently nearly as deep into the nebula as the Cemetery system.", "Vamn ran his lip over the points of his teeth. There was nothing stopping any ship from simply forging straight through the Black Veil, making an ulamow\u2019s-flight path. Nothing, except the hazards and risks of so much uncharted territory and unseen dangers in addition to so many massive gravity fields so close together.", "What Hearthforge had found was a corridor in which \u2013 sometimes partially, sometimes only slightly \u2013 those fields balanced out. It wasn\u2019t an easy passage, or even a safe one. It was just easier and safer. It was a way for a ship, a squadron \u2013 an entire fleet \u2013 to move through of the nebula with a modicum of trust that they wouldn\u2019t be hemorrhaging starships with every shock. In normal space, a path like this would be dismissed. Here, it was a lifeline thrown into choppy seas.", "This was what they\u2019d been looking for. This was their way in. Vamn was careful to temper his excitement and that of his crew, though. If his expedition had found it, than Gravestone must also be aware of this passage. It was probably the way their ships moved through the Black Veil. It would be watched. It would be guarded.", "There\u2019d been no further word from Hearthforge since their courier had arrived, but the prime didn\u2019t expect there to be. Group Leader Prime Nast\u2019wo\u2019s final log indicated that she was continuing to chart the \u2018Twisting Path\u2019 in hopes of getting even deeper into the Black Veil. A scout the size of Hearthforge normally carried only a single courier; the Bastion Leader had ordered all recon forces to carry at least one additional unit, so unless it decided to double back, Hearthforge had just one way to contact Vamn, and they certainly wouldn\u2019t expend it just to follow-up this announcement.", "\u201cPrepare an update for Izabiel,\u201d he told one of his adjutants. \u201cAttach all of Hearthforge\u2019s data. Once that is complete, we\u2019ll deploy it back to 1887-Yiren.\u201d They couldn\u2019t take any chances with losing this information. \u201cAs for us,\u201d he said after a moment. \u201cWe\u2019ll move to support Nast\u2019wo\u2019s attempts to chart this\u2026 Twisting Path.\u201d He felt a smile form. \u2018Twisting Path\u2019 was certainly a vivid and rather apt description, though more poetic than he might have expected from a Thoughtful. Nast\u2019wo was a bit more prone to fancy than the rest of her people, though. While other Thoughtful leaders might put up with such inexact terminology from their crew, they\u2019d never put it into an official document like Nast\u2019wo.", "Vamn\u2019s comm suddenly shrilled. He took it off his belt. \u201cVamn here.\u201d", "It was Renilip. \u201cPrime, we\u2019ve just detected a pair of shockpoints, one hundred million kilometers out. Mid-sized, likely small capital ships. Wait one, their drives just came online. Matching emissions patterns\u2026\u201d there was a pause. \u201cThey\u2019re Scars, patron.\u201d", "Vamn felt his liver drop through his torso. \u201cHave they spotted us?\u201d It normally took a starship several moments or even minutes to recover from a shock, but Gravestone\u2019s vessels frequently so in a fraction of the time. Ecanok\u2019s Blade had been coasting, not under thrust \u2013 if the Scars didn\u2019t notice him, he could enter stealth operations, but if they had\u2026", "A moment passed. Then, the answer he\u2019d been expecting. \u201cConfirmed, patron.   Their acceleration\u2019s climbing and they\u2019re changing course to intercept us.\u201d", "\u201cBattle stations. Bring us to full thrust. Run out the guns. Ready Izabiel for immediate launch.\u201d He couldn\u2019t outrun a Scar for long, but he might not have to. Ecanok\u2019s Blade was twice the length and nearly eight times the mass of the lighter vessels. In a straight-up duel, he had the weight of metal to deal with an entire squadron of vessels that size. Against any other foe, he would have turned and fought. But Scars weren\u2019t repurposed hulls or rebuilt wrecks like the execution force had largely fought here in the Black Veil. They were hideously advanced, and in 1893-Yiren one of them had killed Unspoken Right, a battlecruiser much like Ecanok\u2019s Blade. Vamn still believed he would be victorious against one of those vessels\u2026 but two limited his options.", "He was no coward, but he didn\u2019t intend on being the first ship leader to face a pair of Gravestone\u2019s hunters alone. \u201cMake sure Izabiel deploys astern. They\u2019ll use our drive wake as cover. Spool up the shock drive,\u201d he ordered. \u201cTake us to the nearest libration point for an immediate shock towards the Twisting Path.\u201d The enemy should be too far out to be able to guess his destination. Izabiel would inform the fleet and Ecanok\u2019s Blade would pry one of Gravestone\u2019s secrets out of their hands and with it\u2026", "\u2026with it, you\u2019ll have one less place to hide.", "~", "Something that might have been annoyance jumped from Cerulean Two to Eight, dashing through each strike cruiser\u2019s circuitry. Two was the most mentally developed of all its siblings but it had shared the entirety of its experiences with its kin, and inside them were faint echoes of what was happening within Lakhesis. In this case, Cerulean Eight had misjudged the warp jump. The nebula played havoc with FTL navigation, even for a Coyote and neither AI had had any way of knowing the Enemy\u2019s location or position. They\u2019d been forced to rely on probability estimates of what their foe would do, and very low probabilities at that. It was sheer luck that they\u2019d arrived this close.", "Two seethed, running and re-running calculations and simulations. They were too far away. It would be able to bring the Enemy into range of its Pinaka mass driver and possibly its missiles, but if the enemy ran, if they escaped\u2026! Something shivered through the AI\u2019s mind, a flash of a half-formed concept. If given voice, it would have said if they do, all of this will be for nothing. It couldn\u2019t let that happen.", "Lakhesis diverted as much power as it could to its sublight drives, accelerating towards the distant contact. The Enemy vessel was running on low power mode; it was at least cruiser-weight. Cerulean Two brought its ship-self\u2019s weapons online. Be slow, was the totality of the equations and almost-thoughts running through the shipmind. Be slow, so we can kill you.", "The range dropped. Ninety million kilometers. Eighty. Seventy.", "As the distance dwindled to sixty million kilometers and the red icon of the Enemy vessel crossed an invisible line, Lakhesis offered its foe the finest greeting it could give.", "~", "There was almost no warning. One moment, Ecanok\u2019s Blade was accelerating for all it was worth, a pair of Gravestone\u2019s demons burning hot and hard on its heels and the next an emergency alarm shrieked like a damned soul in recognition of an incoming mass round.", "Moving at nearly ninety percent of light, no organic could hope to react in time, but Ecanok\u2019s Blade wasn\u2019t operated simply by organics. Gravestone\u2019s Chariot carried three meteor cannons \u2013 mass drivers that were more akin to siege weapons than any normal antiship arsenal \u2013 and it was not hesitant to use them. By The Writ, vessels added minor course and thrust variations when closing on an opponent specifically to prevent their vector from being mapped and a salvo of kinetic weaponry dropped right in their path. At long ranges, a foe\u2019s mass rounds had very little chance of striking their targets. Even the Jackals required prolonged target analysis and persistent bombardment from fleets or squadrons to achieve much beyond a relatively small engagement envelope.", "Unlike those kinds of assaults, Gravestone\u2019s meteor cannons launched mass rounds carrying independent drive systems. They could accelerate beyond their launch velocity and adjust their course as they hurtled towards their targets, even able to loop back around if they missed their first attempt. Their target acquisition was also hideously effective, shifting those weapons\u2019 usefulness from \u2018troublesome only if Dame Fortune truly hated you\u2019 to \u2018extreme danger\u2019. To respond to this threat, every ship in the execution force had been given special evasion protocols.", "As soon as Ecanok\u2019s Blade detected the approach of one those rounds, its computers took over from the crew. Faster than Vamn could give an order, let alone wait for it to be heard, processed and enacted upon by by organic minds and bodies, the battlecruiser reacted. The warship\u2019s main computer saw the incoming round, mapped its attack vector, analyzed possible responses, selected evasion as the best choice, ran through dozens of new possible maneuvers and their effect on the ship, crew and operations, selected one and carried it out.", "Two and a half kilometers of starship slewed brutally off-course, thrusters flaring bright and hot as Ecanok\u2019s Blade hurled itself out of the path of the weapon. Vamn dug his claws into his throne\u2019s armests as his vision greyed. His command chair, as well as the seats for his command staff double as an acceleration couch. Not everyone was that lucky. Inertial dampeners fought and failed to handle the sudden maneuver. Unsecured cargo and belongings careened and smashed against bulkheads. Crew who hadn\u2019t had the time to anchor themselves did the same. Bones snapped and fractured as frail organic bodies crashed into unyielding metal, or loose items bounced off of them.", "One thousand and twelve injuries would be reported, twenty-seven of them severe. There would be a single fatality. An unpleasant cost, but a single hit from Gravestone\u2019s Chariot\u2019s meteor cannons could destroy anything smaller than a battleship. The Scars carried much smaller siege weapons, \u2018only\u2019 capable of killing escorts and light cruisers outright. Ecanok\u2019s Blade could withstand a few such hits\u2026 but the enemy had far more than one round to launch. If too many of them got through, the warship would be destroyed before it could escape.", "The weapon scorched by the battlecruiser, too far away to trigger the horrific antimatter charge inside it. Within the impactor, logic engines selected a new course of action. Thrusters flared, pushing the round onto a long, curving turn as it swung around to make a second attack run on Ecanok\u2019s Blade.", "The battlecruiser was ready for it. Targeting sensors followed the weapon as it course-corrected. Counter-missiles racked into launch turrets and turrets. Seconds stretched, became moments. The round was completing its turn, swinging about to face down the warship. The missiles launched, a hurricane of them rushing into the path of the weapon. Dying thrusters sputtered and pulsed as it danced and jinked. Explosions speckled the sky as warheads detonated around it. It was closing\u2026", "Vamn held his breath.", "Then, a flash of light.", "\u201cTarget struck!\u201d cried Guns exuberantly. \u201cTarget struck!\u201d", "The prime exhaled. \u201cAll crew remain secured,\u201d he ordered. \u201cThat was their first shot, not their last.\u201d He didn\u2019t have to wait long before his words were proven correct. At least, he thought to the next shriek of alarms, they\u2019re targeting us and not Izabiel. They hadn\u2019t seen the smaller craft. He\u2019d run. He\u2019d take their fire and pull them further and further from his silent, hidden courier.", "Come on, he thought as his screens bled and his starship suffered. I\u2019m still here. Come and kill me, you pisslicking bastards. Do your best.", "They obliged.", "~", "Plasma streamers arced and skittered across the Enemy battlecruiser\u2019s shields as they shunted away the bulk of the blast, the incandescence of a shield under strain making the distant ship glisten like a star. The second round hadn\u2019t achieved a direct hit \u2013 at these ranges, that would be almost impossible, even with the impactors\u2019 ability to maneuver and IKagge assisting Lakhesis\u2019s targeting. Fortunately, the weapons carried large antimatter reactors that doubled as warheads specifically for these near-misses.", "The inverse square law was not kind to unfocused weapons in space, but the mass rounds\u2019 reactors had been designed with that in mind. The detonations they unleashed were\u2026 exceptionally powerful. Once the onboard computers calculated that the impactor would pass close enough to the target, a catastrophic reactor overload was triggered and their target was bathed in intense radiation, petals of utter annihilation unfurling in all directions. There were no shock waves in space, no medium to carry a concussive blast and only comparatively close detonations had much of an effect\u2026 but the damage from those close detonations was substantial.", "The Enemy\u2019s vessels shields had dropped in effectiveness by 40% from that strike alone, projector systems struggling to shunt away the horrific energy that had washed over the vessel. The battlecruiser could withstand one or two more such hits before its shields overloaded and collapsed. Once those were out of the way, the mass differential between the Enemy and the Fleet units would be irrelevant. They would cut it to pieces\u2026 if they could get close enough.", "Cerulean Two noted this, racked the third of its six rounds into its firing chamber and launched again, readying its missiles as the range between it and its target continued to drop, even as part of its mind wished that its foe had been smaller.", "~", "The second Scar hadn\u2019t fired its meteor cannon, and why it hadn\u2019t became clear as visual data from Ecanok\u2019s Blade\u2019s augur drones trickled in. It was a different hull type from the first vessel. Less like some kind of sword, it was more like a thorned mace. Those barbs though\u2026 Vamn frowned. They looked much like the sensor and comm spines of a Splinter and he suspected that\u2019s exactly what they were, albeit on a smaller scale. That thing was a tracker, trading firepower for improved augurs. Vamn\u2019s gaze focused on the second vessel, looking over the scope returns.

Probably feeding it targeting data. Both Gravestone ships were pushing their augur platforms out. His drones had destroyed two of theirs already. He didn\u2019t know if there were more. The blasted things were even harder to find than Jackal automatons.", "It still tasted like cowardice to disengage from vessels that he out-massed, but the Compact needed information on this route into the nebula, not vainglory. The plan hadn\u2019t changed. He\u2019d draw the attackers away from Izabiel and head down the Twisting Path, link up with Hearthforge. That was more important than pitting himself against this foe.", "\u201cScreens are on the verge of collapse,\u201d Operations informed him. The third mass round had slipped through his defences. One more and Ecanok\u2019s Blade would be left vulnerable. By the time damage control restored screens, they\u2019d be on him. If he were going to stand and fight. As it was, they might bring down his screens\u2026 but that was all of them that they\u2019d get. His opponent knew that. They were \u2013 they had to be \u2013 putting their engines into the orange to overtake him and the gap between Gravestone and his own ship was closing fast, but not fast enough.", "Oh, he\u2019d be in their missile range before he reached the libration point, but those missiles would never reach him.", "He grinned mockingly at the two orange markers on the main screen, his four eyes flitting over to the fuzzy blue icon showing Izabiel\u2019s approximate location. He wished he could give that crew a farewell, but he dared not risk giving their existence away. No, he thought, returning his attention to his enemy. No, you chase me. Not them. I\u2019m the one you want.", "The fourth mass round detonated. The battlecruiser\u2019s screens went down. Scopes called out hostile missile launches. They were burning hotter than previous Scars\u2019 payloads, the engines pushed beyond normal tolerances, sacrificing maneuverability for the small chance of crippling him before he escaped.", "Yes, his enemy definitely knew what was going to happen. They were trying their best to stop him, but their best wasn\u2019t good enough. Not this time.", "Throughout Ecanok\u2019s Blade, power shunted from engines, weapons and defences to its shock systems. The primary reactor surged to meet the demands of violating natural law. The ship was vulnerable. Throughout history, fools and brave souls alike had died in these moments, misjudging how close their enemy was and destroyed when they were at their weakest.", "But not today.", "Armoured silos opened, shockspace steering vanes emerging. Energy crackled and danced between the points of shock generators. A shock field formed. System after system sprung to life; hungry, ravenous and demanding everything Ecanok\u2019s Blade had to offer. The missiles were almost in attack range. Then, reality fractured, collapsed in on itself and Ecanok\u2019s Blade hurled itself into another realm.", "Just before the vessel did so, Vamn felt a smile curl his dark lips.", "You lose. And soon enough, you\u2019ll lose more than this.", "~", "Something akin to dismay flickered through Cerulean Two\u2019s mind. It had failed. The AI ordered its now-useless missiles to self-destruct, though it kept its ship-self on course towards the libration point that the Enemy vessel had vanished through. An interrogative whispered from Two to Eight, a query tinged with something like hope.", "The answer came in the affirmative. IKagge had managed to get one of its sensor drones close enough to the Enemy vessel to analyze its warp jump. Specific emissions from a the warp point and a vessels\u2019s shift systems themselves could be used to provide a general estimate of how much power the vessel was using \u2013 the length of its planned warp \u2013 and potential destinations. These emissions degraded rapidly; unless you were at very close range to a forming warp point you might as well throw darts at a map of the galaxy to discern where your enemy had gone.", "IKagge\u2019s drone hadn\u2019t gotten as close as Eight would have liked. Its readings were incomplete and its data fragmentary but they could still be used to determine the Enemy vessel\u2019s possible destinations, albeit with a higher margin of error than normal.", "Cerulean Eight was running calculations, Two replicating its sibling\u2019s work. All potential vectors were deeper into the nebula, but Two realized it had known where their foe was headed even before the first probability analysis was complete. The Enemy were going to chart out the primary transit line.", "That was not logic. It was not based on fact; the Enemy vessel could have been intending to withdraw, to make an intra-system shock and reposition itself. It could have planned to evade its attackers and double back. There had been no evidence to suggest a course deeper into the nebula, and even some against it\u2026 but Two had known\u2026 it had intuited where its enemy was headed.", "This was not the first time it had come to conclusions in this manner, but this was the clearest of them. Cerulean Two\u2019s mind shifted, rippled as it tried to process this occurrence, before once again shunting it to the side in favour of more comforting, easier to understand operational strictures and protocols.", "As it did so, Two made another query to its sibling. +have you found the courier?+", "+yes+ was the affirmative pulse of Cerulean Eight\u2019s mind, updated telemetry from its sensors and recon platforms providing a rough location. +it doesn\u2019t know it has been detected+ IKagge had spotted the courier\u2019s launch, sifting through the battlecruiser\u2019s ECM and emissions to isolate the minute, telltale indicators of a second drive system. Lakhesis had missed it entirely, but the Coyote hadn\u2019t. It had pushed its drone shell out as far as it could, risking detection. If the battlecruiser had realized its courier had been spotted, it would have either turned and fought to buy the smaller vessel time to escape, or it would have fallen back itself to ensure that its data survived.", "Ignoring the smaller vessel had been a risk. The battlecruiser could still have retreated to its fleet. IKagge might not have been able to narrow down the courier\u2019s current position. It might have run with the larger vessel instead of diverging. Each variable had demanded a different course of action, which would lead to a response from the Enemy, necessitating another decision. Stimulus and response, hundreds of possibilities branching hundreds of times.", "IKagge switched to active sensors, the pulse of its scanners sweeping through the courier\u2019s cloak. Stimulus.", "The courier\u2019s crew, realizing that they\u2019d been discovered, dropped at pretense at stealth and accelerated for the libration point. Response.", "Lakhesis launched a single missile, the warhead flying straight and true. The courier\u2019s point-defence turret sputtered out a volley of hard light, but it couldn\u2019t lock on to the warhead. There was a brief flash and the Enemy vessel\u2019s signal faded away, replaced by the thermal and radiation scar of a missile\u2019s strike. +target eliminated+", "+target eliminated+ Cerulean Eight confirmed. IKagge moved back alongside Lakhesis. There was still work to be done, and an Enemy to kill.", "~", "A mechanical horror scuttled through Oathcurser\u2019s Bane\u2019s hallways. A gunmetal centipede more than three meters long, it was one of a variety of similar machines designated as Assimilators. Engineering units, one of their functions was to survey wrecked vessels, catalogue the contents and prepare the most valuable pieces for recovery. Equally at home in a pressurized starship as the vacuum of space, during boarding operations Assimilators could be deployed onto enemy starships, latching onto comm and sensor arrays to infect those subsystems with hostile scrapcode, or burrowing through the hull to locate, infest or remove interesting bits of technology. In a pinch, they could also be used to extract organic assets, although being held securely in an Assimilator\u2019s cage of limbs was far from a pleasant or calming experience for those involved.", "This Assimilator had found nothing of value. The cruiser had been thoroughly wrecked. The most valuable parts of any starship were its shift systems; if they were irrecoverable, a vessel was usually not worth repairing and Oathcurser\u2019s Bane\u2019s shift systems were completely destroyed, only valuable as raw materials. The entire ship had been designated as refuse and the drone hadn\u2019t encountered anything that disputed the engineering teams\u2019 initial assessment. It wasn\u2019t capable of finding its duties to be a waste of time. It didn\u2019t resent its deployment here. It didn\u2019t get bored surveying section after section of a mutilated, worthless corpse of a starship. It didn\u2019t get tired or find its mind wandering.", "That was why it noticed the splice in a power junction several decks above when an organic surveyor\u2019s attention might have wandered and overlooked such a minor tap of a trickling, fading battery. It was a nonstandard (and crudely-made) splice, directing power into a hull section that the boarding teams had not yet breached. With as close to curiousity as it was capable of, the Assimilator followed the shunt through several decks. The machine was not even as intelligent as the vessels that had deployed it, but it knew the splint was a last-ditch effort to maintain ship systems. That meant one of two things. Something valuable that the dying crew had been desperate to keep operational\u2026", "\u2026or there were still survivors."]}

The battle cruiser was sheltering behind a massive comet. Solar wind and radiation boiled its surface, vapourizing material and forcing it to shed a long tail of gas and fragments of itself. The comet\u2019s nucleus of ice and rock was starting to crack, chasms forming and fault lines widening under the star\u2019s heat. Either on this pass through the system or the next, it would fall apart, becoming a collection of more than a dozen large pieces. Perhaps it could even introduce the necessary elements for life on the planets before eventually being pulled from its course by the system\u2019s largest gas giant and swallowed whole. Until any of those fates came to pass, it served as an effective hiding spot for the Compact warship.", "The moment his ship\u2019s systems had stabilized and augurs came back on-line after shocking into this system, Vamn had ordered stealth operations, the battlecruiser quickly shrouding itself. He didn\u2019t believe that Gravestone had been able to pull a vector from his shockpoint, but he wouldn\u2019t take the risk. His courier would alert local command to the Twisting Path. His mission now was to link up with Hearthforge and complete the route\u2019s exploration.", "Already, the Twisting Path had given them a semi-stable route that bypassed many of the Black Veil\u2019s hazards, but the deep nebula was denser and more filled with anomalies, half-born systems, rogue stars, novae and worse.

Two separate signatures. Based on the emissions strength, they may be cruiser-scale.\u201d Larger vessels or synchronized fleets created correspondingly sized shockpoints, but determining the scale of a vessel from the energy emitted by one of the apertures was more akin to divination than science. In both the figurative and literal senses, each shockpoint put out stellar levels of energy. The variations between an escort, a cruiser and a dreadnought\u2019s emergence were difficult enough to determine in open skies. With Ecanok\u2019s Blade blinded by its own cloaking field and its only window into its surroundings coming from the passive scopes of tethered augur platforms, Vamn\u2019s scopes officer and analytical subroutines might as well be staring into a prism and clucking out gobbledygook like a fortune teller.", "But then, the Tribune thought sardonically. They\u2019re hardly wrong, now are they? He knew exactly what had come after them. Vamn\u2019s eyes narrowed and he leaned forward in his chair, a breathless anticipation clutching his chest. The hunters had arrived.", "~", "Where are you?", "That was the distillation of Cerulean Two\u2019s function processes as Lakhesis and IKagge warped into the target system.

A warp point remained open only as long as it was forced to. Regardless of how far a ship intended to go, or how deep it was about to enter shift space, the creation of a warp point was the greatest energy cost. Maintaining a shift field to protect a vessel from damage during a warp jump, utilizing shift drives for controlled movement through the other realm, the deployment of navigation vanes and their generation of stabilization fields to give a vessel some minor ability to alter course while at warp\u2026 these were all substantial power drains in their own right, but it was safely tearing its way into or out of shiftspace that was the most difficult and ravenous part of FTL travel. It wasn\u2019t a neat, clean little portal, but an affront to physical law, a tear in reality made in the same manner as an animals\u2019s claws raking across the flesh of its victim. It roiled, fighting to close, tugging and pushing against the physical interlopers that tried to pass through, and it was never a clean or easy process.", "Every vessel that emerged from shiftspace was saturated with energy, left blinded, helpless and struggling to vent away the unwanted afterbirth of its arrival. It took a modern Compact vessel up to two minutes to recover from a warp jump. Both Lakhesis and IKagge could do so within thirty seconds. As their sensors cleared, hangar bays opened and sensor drones whisked out to create an ever-expanding globe around the vessels, searching for traces of their quarry.", "A star system was a large place to hide, and though the pair of strike cruisers had shortened their targets\u2019 lead, it had still been enough to allow the foe to vanish from open space.

This facility was situated below the bridge, and provided additional command and control when the vessel operated as a sigil ship, coordinating the movements of multiple squadrons. Its location, lower ceiling and rows of consoles gave it a closed-in atmosphere, and those officers and crew who were tasked here jokingly referred to it as \u2018the pit\u2019.", "In desperate circumstances, it could double as makeshift means of operating the vessel, though if the bridge was lost, the strategy center was all but assured to be destroyed along with it. Currently, the pit\u2019s duties were not that dire. Vamn had ordered ongoing combat simulations to be run from auxiliary control and the strategy center. The Tribune would prefer not to face Gravestone alone, but he fully expected to encounter them again.", "Auxiliary was running a simulated engagement against a pack of Slashes. Here in the strategy center, the officers and crew were engaged with the Cicatrix. Ecanok\u2019s Blade had arrived later than most to Galhemna and the battle had been over by the time it had. It would have made no difference, though: even the earlier-arriving van had been unable to engage Gravestone\u2019s forces before they quit the field. Despite that failure, every member of the execution force had received briefings, tactical updates, scope data and technical analyses on Gravestone\u2019s attack force from Galhemna\u2019s survivors, priceless information on the capabilities of their foe.", "Vamn had been reviewing the Galhemna data. There was far too little on the Cicatrices; until now, his foe had been classified by the simple appellation of Scar 3rd\u200b. They\u2019d kept back from the battle line along with the Scar 2nd\u200bs. Those hull types were easier to classify; they were missile platforms, but information on Cicatrix capabilities was sparser. Indeed, during the siege their augur mounts had been mistaken for weapons towers. However much of their firepower had been sacrificed for those augurs was still unknown. Vamn doubted that it was helpless, or even close to helpless \u2013 otherwise why build it when the Splinters fulfilled the same role \u2013 but it was much smaller than Ecanok\u2019s Blade\u2026 and he wanted to test it. Nothing of his ship\u2019s weight of metal had faced those vessels in Galhemna. He suspected that there was a reason for that and he wanted to confirm his hunch.", "The Tribune let out a breath through his nostrils as he surveyed the display, passing quietly behind rows of officers, listening to their reports and seeing how they handled the battle. His time would come. Soon. Probably not today, but soon enough. The battle he was craving would happen, but if he rushed, if he was careless, it would end in disaster. No matter how much his liver insisted that he face his foe, his mind overruled that desire. Strategy before instinct.", "Beyond the hull of his ship, the enemy was stalking him. They were methodical and logical in their approach; their first objective was the broiling gas world closest to Ecanok\u2019s Blade\u2019s emergence point \u2013 or where it would have emerged, had he not pushed the edge of the shock limit. Through the tethered scope nodes peering out from Ecanok\u2019s Blade\u2019s cloaking field, Vamn had seen multiple antimatter detonations erupting within the planet\u2019s atmosphere. Each titanic blast sent horrific shock waves broiling through the planet\u2019s cloud layers, igniting vast pockets of hydrogen. Firestorms raged across the planet\u2019s face.

The Coyote strike cruisers had been designed for just this kind of operation. Cloaking systems weren\u2019t perfect; they were substantial power drains, blinded their users almost as much as any pursuer, and this Enemy vessel was at the upper limit for what could feasibly be hidden by cloaking technology.", "Stealth systems worked better when used in conjunction with natural phenomena; even a vessel simply running under strict emissions control could conceal themselves amongst certain astrographical features. When the vessel in question was using active countermeasures such as a cloaking field, a helpfully obfuscating environment became exponentially more effective. Gas giants were a consistent favourite \u2013 the stormier and more radiative the better. Their turbulent atmospheres, debris-choked rings and cluttered orbits of moons and asteroid fields created a wealth of hiding and ambush positions.", "As the eighth planet in this nameless system heaved in agony from antimatter bombing, Cerulean Two ran through the strike cruisers\u2019 search parameters once again. This planet had been the best possibility. It was closest to the most likely emergence point, it was hot, energetic and had nearly seventy-three moons. Though the search had just begun, Two suspected that further sweeps of this planet would be fruitless. Its attention drifted, focusing on a sizable comet hurtling sunwards as it plowed through the protoplanetary nebula.", "Something about that comet caught Two\u2019s attention. As a hiding spot, it had been given a lower probability than the planets and moons Lakhesis and IKagge were currently searching. It was large enough to hide several vessels in its contrail \u2013 though a disturbance of that size would be detectable\u2013 and it was shedding fairly sizable pieces of itself under the heat and solar wind from the star. Even something the size of the battlecruiser had cause to be concerned from impacts of that scale.", "It was a good possibility, but not the best one\u2026 and yet, Cerulean Two\u2019s focus returned to it again and again. A thick, large tail of gases, ice and rock thousands of kilometers long would make it difficult to pick out a single ship and the comet\u2019s course took it close to a libration point. If a vessel equipped with modern Compact shift systems had pushed the margin of error for warping in-system, the comet would have been within reach with just enough time for the ship\u2019s drive wake to dissipate. That comet was where Lakhesis itself might have chosen to hide under similar circumstances.", "Cerulean Two\u2019s ship-self was on the far side of the gas planet.

He hoped it would be enough to overwhelm their defences. The weight of fire had to compensate for the degraded targeting, and the increased time to reach their target. Without the additional speed boost from their launch tubes, the missiles would require longer than usual to reach attack range, but they burned hard, accelerating towards the enemy cruiser. Several were destroyed or disabled early due to impacts from cometary fragments, but the losses were well within expected limits.

He\u2019d known to expect this rapid a response from Gravestone, but that made it no less galling or dangerous.

Under battle conditions, smaller secondary reactors were ignited to ensure a steady and uninterrupted flow of power rather than risk systems failures at a critical juncture as the demands on the main reactor increased. The primary core could itself be run at a higher output than normal, though this was not without risk. There were many safeguards in place to prevent a vessel\u2019s reactor from accidental overload, but what Vamn had asked of his chief engineer and the entire department was to deliberately circumvent many of those safeguards.", "Ecanok\u2019s Blade had been running with its reactor on the lowest possible output to reduce waste heat and help the battlecruiser\u2019s concealment. Powering up a phased-sequence exotic matter manifold was not something that could be done swiftly or easily. By The Writ, it would take several minutes \u2013 sometimes much longer \u2013 to safely draw the core from minimal reaction levels to higher output, but Ecanok\u2019s Blade did not have those minutes.", "The Cicatrix fired a volley less than a third the size of the Compact warship\u2019s own, but its missiles were smarter, faster, carried larger warheads and were not relying on the dim eyes of tethered scopes to guide them to their quarry. The strike cruiser\u2019s own augurs and those of its drones had a shooting solution on the battlecruiser. Ecanok\u2019s Blade had revealed itself the instant it launched n and the smaller warship responded just as quickly as Vamn had expected. An alarm wailed as his scopes detected missile drives scorching in at him, much faster than his own. They\u2019d reach him before his weapons engaged the Gravestone vessel.", "\u201cFusion One on-line,\u201d Operations reported. \u201cFusion Two is blue.\u201d Those were the battlecruiser\u2019s secondary reactors. Massive, with energy output that more primitive civilizations would salivate over, they were still only a very small part of what Ecanok\u2019s Blade needed. Engines. Not enough power. Point defences. Not enough power. Screens. Not enough power. When they arrived, those warheads would wreak havoc and there wasn\u2019t enough time for Ecanok\u2019s Blade to respond. Not by the Writ.", "There was no alarm. Those had been silenced, but what happened in Engineering should have set them off throughout the ship. Sem-Trilln-Com had overridden, shut down and re-routed a dozen different power feeds and safeguard systems. The battlecruiser\u2019s beating heart roared to life, so powerfully and violently that it damaged its own containment housing, causing overloads and power surges throughout the ship.", "Inside the Main Engineering, radiation alarms shrilled. The crew had been prepared and had already donned protective gear. It wouldn\u2019t be enough, not with the damage the core had already inflicted on its shielding. Diagnostics shrilled in warning as the overload continued to claw at its containment housing and rad-counters ticked higher by the second. There would be multiple cases of radiation poisoning among the engineering teams and the damage to the starship\u2019s reactor and power distribution grid would take weeks to repair. Ecanok\u2019s Blade was even now risking a critical reactor breach. At best, that would have led to an emergency shutdown. At worst, it would have ripped two and half kilometers of starship in half.", "These reactors were the best, safest form of power generation the Compact used. Under ordinary conditions, the risk of a breach was all but nonexistent. This was far from those circumstances, and the chained apocalypse at the heart of the warship spasmed and battered at the cage holding it, as expressing its fury towards the insignificant specks who attempted to make such demands of it. The reaction was threatening to spiral out of control and with so many safeguards circumvented, there would be no way to stop it.", "But it gave the battlecruiser exactly what it needed: a chance.", "Ecanok\u2019s Blade surged to life, its engines flaring with power, its screens rising to full strength and its weapons drinking deep from the energy pulsing through its damaged and strained conduits. Vamn grinned. The Triarchs were with them today. He knew what he\u2019d done, though. In Engineering, Sem-Trilln-Com and his crews would be fighting desperately in a contaminated environment to bring the reactor back within safe limits and prevent their leader\u2019s plan from killing them all.", "That was their battle; Vamn had one of his own now.", "Targeting scopes licked out, finding prey in the incoming missile swarm. Interceptors racked into launch tubes. Turrets and laser cannon swiveled and prepared to engage the enemy salvo. His own launch was closing on the foe as well.", "\u201cNow,\u201d Vamn said, licking his tongue over his teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with one of my lies.\u201d", "I hope you choke on it.", "~", "Lakhesis drew alongside the damaged IKagge. Eight\u2019s ship-self had several large fissures in its hull, the edges melted, fused and re-frozen into new shapes. Despite the intense radioactivity surrounding those wounds, the scout strike cruiser\u2019s arsenal of engineering drones was hard at work. As their systems degraded and the automatons failed, they were carried back inside for decontamination and reclamation, cannibalized to produce the next generation. That practice might seem ghastly to organic observers, but that kind of emotional determination was pure anthropomorphism. Aside from being machines, Cerulean Eight had nothing in common with its servicers. They were not, and could not become, sapient. The machines were simply resources and expended as such.", "Two focused its attention on the short-range scanners it was playing over its sibling\u2019s body, noting every injury and committing them to its archives. The barrage had breached IKagge\u2019s port shields, and that was where the damage was heaviest. There\u2019d been so many missiles that the strike cruiser hadn\u2019t had time for the downed shield to reset and several missiles had struck at the bare hull. IKagge had lost multiple weapons emplacements, shield projectors, thruster banks and two of its sensor arrays. The damage wasn\u2019t heavy, but it impacted the Coyote\u2019s capabilities.", "Adding injury to injury, the Enemy vessel had crossed the strike cruiser\u2019s prow before retreating, raking IKagge with several lighter follow-up salvos. It had been careful to stay out of energy and real-time range, not willing to risk Cerulean Eight using cyberwarfare attacks against it. It also hadn\u2019t attempted to press its advantage; Lakhesis had been red-lining its drives as it came rushing to defend its sibling. The Enemy was willing to face one of the Fleet alone, but not two. If it had, the clash would have ended differently.", "Something like regret flicked through Cerulean Two. It hadn\u2019t anticipated that the Enemy would respond as quickly as they had. The battlecruiser\u2019s shift from somnolence to battle-readiness and the ensuing telltale perturbations in its signal leakage showed what it had done. In its simulations for the Enemy using the comet as cover, Two predicted that it would either activate before IKagge\u2019s arrival and run or the Coyote would catch it by surprise. This level of aggression had been a very low probability.", "Two was now re-evaluating its models and adjusting them for future encounters. As it did that, another part of the AI was trying to estimate the damage and casualties the Enemy had caused to themselves. There were too many unknowns, but the answer was the same regardless of the variables Two used: not enough.", "Another part of Cerulean Two was engaged in what organics would have called hindsight. Lakhesis was better suited for combat operations. It should have gone instead of IKagge. It could have used its Pinaka to pick the Enemy off before it could activate. It should have taken the sunward position around the planet and been closer to the comet\u2019s position. It should have been the one to do this. Because it hadn\u2019t, IKagge had been damaged.", "Cerulean Two sent yet another status query to its sibling, confirming its functionality. Eight, having already fielded several of these, responded with something approaching testiness at the repeated question. It was operational, damage control systems had begun work and repairs could be done in-flight. Shipyard convalescence was not required.", "Two accepted the data. The two AIs datalinked as they planned their next move.", "The Enemy had evaded them again, and this time there was no telling where it had gone. It could have retreated, it could have run for deep space, it could have continued along the transit line. It would have to be found, though. It couldn\u2019t be allowed to escape. The data it already had was dangerous; if the Enemy fleet learned of the transit line, the Fleet\u2019s security would be in even greater peril.", "Those were all logical, pragmatic reasons to find and destroy the hostile, but there was another one flickering in the deepest recesses of Cerulean Two\u2019s nascent gestalt. The machine didn\u2019t acknowledge it, nor even truly realize that it was there, but it was. It had formed as plasma fires had enveloped IKagge, coalesced as the Enemy volley-fired into Eight\u2019s ship-self and fled, and hardened into something concrete as Two saw the damage that its kin had taken.

Of attempts to hide broken by sudden, desperate flight which itself was only interrupted by brief, snapshot violence as Gravestone\u2019s hounds located Ecaonk\u2019s Blade.

He\u2019d lose them \u2013 or thought he\u2019d lost them \u2013 only to be drawn from a meal, or woken to either to his comm reporting enemy contacts or the shriek of alarms as hostile missiles were detected. He\u2019d slept little, eaten when he could in a rush.

It wasn\u2019t easy. They\u2019d at least managed to shake pursuit yet again, long enough to shock out and reach this new system. The jump had been difficult. Not as much as others, though. Hearthforge\u2019s data was correct. There was a path through this wretched nebula.", "If only we\u2019d been the first to find it.", "Vamn\u2019s earlier assumptions had been proven correct; the foe did indeed know about the Twisting Path. Scopes had discovered several augur stations. They weren\u2019t easy to find; he was certain he\u2019d missed many more than the two Ecanok\u2019s Blade had discovered, but they were how the enemy ships were tracking him. He\u2019d learned that on his third encounter. Ecanok\u2019s Blade had been running silent when the Scar and Cicatrix had arrived. They hadn\u2019t seen him, but he\u2019d picked up a comm burst from the Cicatrix. Two hours later, there\u2019d been an answer from a heretofore unknown source. Shortly after they\u2019d received that message, the enemy ships had changed course towards Ecanok\u2019s Blade. They hadn\u2019t seen him, but they\u2019d known he was there.", "Triarchs damn them to the Black.", "This system, once un-named, had been given a simple appellation: Path 4. Path 1, Vamn had decided, was where they had received Hearthforge\u2019s courier. Path 2 was the sight of their counter-ambush. Path 3\u2026 that had been a warren of brambles, where a battlecruiser of the Compact Space Force was forced to run like a frightened varak searching for holes to crawl into, shivering in fear of prowling ashti. It was an affront to everything he stood for, but there\u2019d been few other options.", "The Scar was staying close to its scouting companion. They weren\u2019t letting themselves be split up like before; when one moved to attack, the other stayed with it\u2026 or flanked him in one particularly unpleasant instance. He\u2019d let his overconfidence take hold, thinking the Cicatrix had been left alone again and turned to face it. He\u2019d realized only moments before it was too late that the Scar was flanking him. They\u2019d expected him to try another attack, baited him into doing so. Ecanok\u2019s Blade had barely gotten away. The enemy were fast, quick to respond and extremely deadly. It was taking all his skill combined with that of his crew and more than a sliver of Fortune\u2019s ever-mercurial grace to avoid death.", "At least he\u2019d gotten more of a piece of the Cicatrix than he\u2019d thought he had, and the enemy had learned caution.", "Good.", "Vamn turned a cog wheel, checking how all the others slotted into it turned. Everything seemed to be working fine there. If only everything else was so easy. His ship was still injured, as were many of his engineers and technicians. The damage to the primary reactor core had been worse than expected. Sem-Trilln-Com was shutting down select portions of the battlecruiser\u2019s power grid to do necessary repairs, but the constant attacks made that difficult, exacerbating the damage. They needed a few days, just a few to slip their leash and recover.", "They\u2019d managed to \u2018escape\u2019 from Path 3, Gravestone once again showing how far they\u2019d go to flush him out. That had been closer than all the others. Even this system wasn\u2019t free of their ruthlessness.", "They\u2019d discovered Hearthforge \u2013 at, least what was left of it. The light cruiser had been destroyed, turned into a holed wreck swarming with Gravestone\u2019s abominate machines. Whoever these people were, they were cowards and heretics \u2013 if such a term could be applied to those who defied a purely secular ideology \u2013 never showing their faces, embracing machines far more than any true civilization should. They used mechanical horrors to kill for them, so that they never needed to risk their own lives and in doing so proved their barbarity and madness.", "There were stories that Vamn had heard, not just from the lower decks, but from officers and even his peers in the execution force. These rumours said that Gravestone\u2019s crew and its machines were one and the same, that inside each of those metal shells was an organic brain, cut from its body and installed like mere hardware. It was also whispered that their starships operated in the same grotesque manner, with living minds sealed into work stations, only removed to be placed inside some new monstrosity.", "Others said that Gravestone had gone even further than that; there was no flesh at all in those automatons, but uploaded minds. The thought made Vamn\u2019s liver feel cold and tight. This Enemy might as well be the Devoured. And that was the most horrifying possibility of all; the most outlandish stories also said that Gravestone and the Devoured were one and the same, either a fragment of that corrupt civilization that had survived millennia, or a piece of infective scrapcode that someone else had stumbled upon, giving birth to another trans-organic horror.", "Vamn didn\u2019t know the truth of Gravestone. He knew enough to respect their capabilities and not to underestimate them, but they were still cowards and butchers, scavengers and assassins. They deserved to be destroyed. What they\u2019d done to Hearthforge was only more proof of that. Some of the crew had survived the vessel\u2019s destruction. It wasn\u2019t that unusual; more often than not, a starship simply stopped working rather than exploding violently and much of it would remain relatively intact.", "The last of Hearthforge\u2019s crew had died less than seventeen hours before Ecanok\u2019s Blade had reached the wreck. The final sealed compartment had been breached by Gravestone\u2019s monstrosities. The scout\u2019s remaining crew had fought until the last. The group leader prime had made note of their names for posthumous commendation, and ordered the wreck mined. He would have preferred to salvage it, but it was too deep in the nebula and he didn\u2019t know how much time he had before the hounds arrived again. Instead, he would take comfort knowing that Gravestone would not receive a butcher\u2019s wage from this vessel.", "That had left him with a decision to make. His plan had been to link up with Nast\u2019wo and continue to chart this route, but with Hearthforge\u2019s destruction, he had but a single ship for that task. Caution told him to double back, get clear of the nebula, repair his vessel and wait for a reconnaissance in force to sweep the Twisting Path. Instinct told him that he couldn\u2019t wait. It would take weeks to assemble enough ships to do that. Gravestone would certainly know what he\u2019d done and what he planned.", "Their industry had been smashed \u2013 at least that which the execution had seen \u2013 but he couldn\u2019t say for certain what they had left. They might simply scatter some mines and hope for the best. They might relocate citadels and turn the Path into another grinding slaughter. They might assemble a squadron of their own. They might\u2026", "\u2026the vision of a squadron of Slashes backed up by Scars and Cicatrices came to Vamn\u2019s mind immediately, causing him to drop the cogwheel he\u2019d been holding in his forceps. More than Gravestone\u2019s largest warships, more than the strike cruisers, it was the Slashes he hated most. Small, vicious things that only appeared on scopes in the instant before they opened fire. He didn\u2019t know how many of those Gravestone had left, but even one was too many.", "The more time he took to prepare, the greater his odds of success: a squadron could accomplish what a single ship might die attempting. Conversely, the more time that he gave his enemy, the more likely it was that they could close this door and the cost of delving into the nebula would continue to climb. More ships would suffer the fates of Hearthforge and Oathcurser\u2019s Bane.", "Those were his options: risk his ship for a greater reward, or choose hesitancy and risk losing everything. His senior officers were split, but even if they had been unified, the choice was ultimately his\u2026 and in the end, it was no choice at all. He thought of his sister and Oathcurser\u2019s Bane, and the decision was easy. If he wanted to play it safe, he wouldn\u2019t have volunteered for this mission.", "\u201cOnward,\u201d he said to the empty room as he picked the small gear back up and resumed his work. \u201cWe\u2019ll go onward.\u201d", "~", "The hunt continued. Long intervals of searching were interspersed with brief flurries of violence as IKagge and Lakhesis clashed with the Enemy warship.

It was frustration, or as close to it as the AI\u2019s developing mind could come. Eight didn\u2019t feel it in the same manner, but it was present in the other AI too. An unsolved puzzle, an incomplete mission\u2026 unfinished business.", "The Enemy vessel had eluded them again, but it had made a mistake. This time when it jumped away, IKagge had gotten a solid read on its warp point. Not from one of its drones, either. The strike cruisers had flushed the Enemy from its last hiding place \u2013 the shattered wreckage of a rocky planet ripped apart by the tidal forces of the system\u2019s primary and the supermassive gas giant within the system\u2019s Goldilocks zone. The competing gravitational stresses had shaken the small Hadean world apart and in time, it would become a large asteroid belt that circled the inner system.", "Taking refuge amidst the rolling moon- and continent-sized planetary remains, the Enemy vessel had been hoping that its opponents wouldn\u2019t follow it into such a dangerous environment. Two had been willing to do just that, but Eight had suggested an alternative. Instead of igniting a gas giant\u2019s atmosphere, they\u2019d captured outlying asteroids and accelerated them into the largest bodies of debris, the violent collisions either smashing billions of tonnes of planet off their orbits, or fragmenting them and sending city-sized pieces of rock spraying in all directions like titanic shrapnel, turning a \u2018safe\u2019 hiding spot into a killing field.", "Their quarry had run, the pair of strike cruisers close on its heels, but it had slipped through their grasp. Again.", "+frustration+", "The Enemy warship hadn\u2019t gone further down the transit line. Its most likely destination, insofar as Cerulean Eight had calculated, was one of the line\u2019s \u2018dead ends\u2019. Of course, it could drop out halfway through in interstellar space, but this particular warp route was extremely unstable due to a nearby cluster of brown dwarfs. Even across a span of light years, there were few regions calm enough for a starship to risk an emergence from shiftspace, and the two most suitable locations had defences of their own. If the battlecruiser tried to drop from warp and double back, it would regret its decision.", "It had to come back, though. That was Cerulean Eight\u2019s determination. The Enemy vessel would either have to return to a moderately-safe route, or risk destruction with the next warp jump it made. The pains it had already taken to preserve itself indicated it would choose the former.", "Two wasn\u2019t convinced. The Enemy had risked themselves multiple times in their encounters; damaging its power grid with the core push, flying into the deadly wreckage of the destroyed planet. The Enemy commander was bold. Two was starting to think that this warp had not been a mistake after all, but a deliberate ploy.", "Eight\u2019s response was a slurry of simulations, most of which showed various probabilities of the Enemy crippling itself irrevocably in FTL. This was the logical, practical decision. Wait and ambush their target. It had worked on the scout, now turned into a dispersing field of vapour thanks to the Enemy\u2019s actions.", "Second after second passed as Cerulean Two tried to weigh the scales in its mind: the equations that pointed out what was likely to happen, or the unknown, increasingly-common sensation that told it otherwise. If it guessed wrong, the Enemy would escape. Seconds turned to moments. IKagge sent a query to its sibling. Lakhesis had never taken this long to respond before.", "Finally, Two made its decision. They would have to split up. One remaining here in case the Enemy did return, and the other following its seemingly-panicked and mistaken course. Two didn\u2019t want to do this. IKagge was damaged. If it confronted the battlecruiser alone, its odds of victory were diminished, but the Coyote also had more capable shift systems. It would be best suited to navigate the snarled warp routes and locate the Enemy if it attempted to hide again. Lakhesis was better suited to engaging the hostile, though\u2026 and its own sensors and shift systems remained generations ahead of anything the Enemy possessed.", "The choice was made. One strike cruiser remained behind, the other tearing a hole into reality and passing into another dimension to continue the hunt.", "One way or another, the Enemy would die.", "~", "\u201cYou\u2019ve been asking a lot from this ship.\u201d Renilip mentioned to her prime. They were sharing dinner in the leader\u2019s mess, Vamn\u2019s personal dining room. Rank had a few privileges, and this was one of them. He made it a point to dine with a different section head at least three days a week. On the fourth day, he occasionally selected a member of the crew that he felt had done well. If not, that and the fifth day were his chance for a private meal. Over the past few weeks, that tradition had fallen by the wayside. He, like most of his crew and officers, had been too busy for a social event. Today there was a moment to stop and catch their breath.", "Vamn nodded slowly. \u201cI know.\u201d He picked up a cup of spiced water and swirled it. \u201cAnd the crew, too.\u201d He pre-empted his first officer\u2019s next comment. \u201cI\u2019ll be asking more of them before this is over. Without Hearthforge, we are the only way to discover where this trail leads without giving our adversary time to defend it.\u201d", "Renilip\u2019s large eyes blinked. \u201cYes,\u201d she agreed. \u201cThe crew knows why we are doing this. We stand ready, prime, but I would not be doing my duty if I did not bring this to your attention.\u201d", "The Tribune grinned slightly. While a leader handled their ship, the first officer handled the leader. He\u2019d known about the crew\u2019s unease, but a commander who relied solely upon what they \u2018knew\u2019 often knew very little. Renilip almost certainly more informed than he was, and he appreciated her attention to crew morale. It was an easy thing to let slide in circumstances such as these, but no less important than any technical or tactical facet of command. He\u2019d known leaders who\u2019d pushed their crew too much and paid too little attention to what was happening on their ship, to the detriment of all three.", "He might be a \u2018fire-eater\u2019, but he knew what he was asking of his ship and his people. He knew the risks they had already taken, the cost of each of his decisions and the likely price of his next choice.", "\u201cOnce Sem-Trilln-Com has rated our power grid acceptable, we\u2019ll leave this system.\u201d He\u2019d deliberately ordered Ecanok\u2019s Blade off the Twisting Path, hoping to buy a few extra days. He wasn\u2019t certain if the Cicatrix had pulled a vector from his shock, but whether it had or hadn\u2019t suited his needs.", "If he had been facing any other foe, he would have shocked back into normal space before reaching this system, waited in interstellar space until his drives and systems were repaired as much as they could be, then returned to Path 4 and continued their reconnaissance. Gravestone was methodical to a fault, though. And very capable of predicting the Compact\u2019s choices, as well as possessing an affinity for nasty surprises. If he were them, he would have something waiting in the calmer regions. Mines to attack any unauthorized vessel that came out of shockspace there, couriers to alert their mobile forces of his presence, sentry ships or all three.", "So he\u2019d continued to another nameless star system, now simply known as Off-Path 1. It was older, and slightly cooler than Paths 3 and 4. Its planets were still hot, but they had completely formed and the system wasn\u2019t pulled apart by the nearby cluster of brown dwarfs, it would drift out of the Black Veil. Other than that, there was little to recommend it. Vamn supposed a system survey would turn up a wealth of information and valuable resources, but he had neither the time nor inclination for that. We\u2019re being relentlessly hunted by hostile ships \u2013 let\u2019s abandon all stealth and begin some planetary explorations! He almost chuckled at the absurdity of it.", "It had been several days since either Scar or Cicatrix had shown up on their scopes. He was starting to think his gambit had worked. For now: if they didn\u2019t already know, his enemy would suspect what he\u2019d done. They\u2019d return to Path 4 and wait in ambush, counting on him not being insane enough to do what he was about to suggest doing. To be fair, that wasn\u2019t exactly an oversight on their part. Insanity was perhaps the best possible descriptor.", "\u201cWe won\u2019t be returning to Path 4,\u201d he told his first officer. \u201cWe\u2019ll be shocking from here to Path 5.\u201d", "The Judiciary froze with a fork halfway to her mouth. She stared at her prime, hoping this was some kind of bizarre joke.", "It wasn\u2019t. The Black Veil was dangerous enough already. Tempting Fortune by shocking through an extremely turbulent and uncharted route was perhaps the most extreme risk Vamn had ever taken in his career. He didn\u2019t wait for her to gather her wits. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be waiting for us in Path 4,\u201d he told her. \u201cThe time we\u2019ve taken for repairs is the time they\u2019ve had to realize we\u2019re not where we should be.\u201d", "\u201cThey might not know where we\u2019ve gone,\u201d Renilip pointed out.", "\u201cPerhaps, but they won\u2019t have to. Whether or not they read our shock, they\u2019ll eventually assume that we went off-course and that as soon as we notice that, we\u2019ll do the reasonable thing. We\u2019ll backtrack along a,\u201d he chuckled darkly, \u201c\u2018safe\u2019 shock route to continue down the Path.

Without informing me? \u201cWhat have they said?\u201d", "\u201cIf we stay slow enough and keep as close to the upper boundaries of shockspace as possible, we can cross this route. For maximum safety, it will take several realspace reversions \u2013 as little as four, maybe as many as seven.\u201d", "The woman winced, already anticipating Sem-Trilln-Com\u2019s imminent conniption. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be extremely hard on our shock systems, patron. Our power grid still isn\u2019t fully repaired, either. That many shocks in this kind of region\u2026\u201d A lot of little shocks were much more energy demanding, expensive and inefficient than a few long ones, and Ecanok\u2019s Blade was still dealing with damage from the reactor push and the various running battles. \u201cI suppose a positive to this\u2026\u201d she hesitated before saying the word, \u201c\u2026plan is that it will take long enough that they may just completely lose track of us, but still\u2026\u201d she trailed off.", "They both knew what she were going to say. This was extremely risky. They could go back, but with Hearthforge\u2019s loss, confirming that the Twisting Path was everything Nast\u2019wo had believed it to be was up to them and them alone. Gravestone was at their weakest. They didn\u2019t have the ships to spare to box Ecanok\u2019s Blade in or blockade every system. This was the Compact\u2019s best chance to strip away one of Gravestone\u2019s most vital secrets, their best chance to find a way in and out of the Black Veil without suffering horrific losses.

Lakhesis had dropped from warp to check the potential emergence points along this route, but neither had noted the arrival of any other vessels. The Enemy could have dropped out elsewhere. If it had, it was almost certainly dead. This particular warp route was especially treacherous, the gravity wells of so many failed and half-born stars snarling local shiftspace into knots. Even for Two, the journey was not an easy one, but it was faster and smoother than it would have been for any Enemy vessel.", "Lakhesis had arrived in the destination system several days ago. Since then, the strike cruiser had been on search and destroy operations. Unsuccessful search and destroy operations. There was no indication that the Enemy vessel was still here. At first, that suggested to Two that Eight\u2019s interpretation of events had been the correct one. The Enemy had realized that this system was a relative dead-end and doubled back to find a safer path through the nebula. That was sensible and practical. The logical course of action would be to do the same and rejoin IKagge. Also sensible and practical.", "But.", "+the enemy isn\u2019t sensible+", "That thought had come to Two repeatedly as it considered its next course of action. The AI wondered if the Enemy commander had deliberately chosen this route to throw off the Ceruleans\u2019 pursuit. If he\u2019d done that, it would have done him no good to loop back around and return to a system he knew would be unsafe. He might have assumed that the Fleet units would have quit the system to track him down, or\u2026", "\u2026or he never intended to return there.", "Two immediately dismissed any thought of the Enemy withdrawing; the time to do that had come and gone. The intruder\u2019s behaviour made their intent crystal clear. They were desperate to map this warp route and find a way into the nebula for their forces. If they\u2019d intended to retreat, they would have done so long before now.", "The AI ran calculations. The \u2018safest\u2019 warp route from here to the next system in the transit line had a massive probability of crippling or destroying any vessel that attempted to cross it. Initial simulation results confirmed that. Repeating those analyses took three point seven seconds of the AI\u2019s time. The outcomes didn\u2019t change. It would be suicide to attempt a warp jump through a cluster of brown dwarfs.", "Two reconsidered its data, applying what it knew of its foe. The Enemy commander was bold, even reckless, taking chances that more cautious officers would have balked at. So far, those risks had paid off. By all practical understanding the Enemy should fall back. Simulations suggesting that any commander would risk their ship to this degree by cutting through the cluster of protostars had to be resolved at a p-value of <0.0001 to confirm that hypothesis. It was, in a word, statistically insignificant\u2026 but that answer didn\u2019t feel right.", "+anomaly+", "That concept in and of itself was bizarre and incompatible with Two\u2019s original programming. It had no intuition, nothing to rely on in its estimates and studies but the data it directly observed. That had functioned well for it, but over the last several months, those new and anomalous variables had repeatedly intruded on its thought processes and logic trees. Based entirely on the latter, the Enemy had either returned to the transit line, or was en route to it now. Lakhesis should therefore rejoin its sibling to continue the hunt.", "Based on nothing but the observed irrationality of the Enemy commander, Cerulean Two felt the other option was the correct one. It couldn\u2019t have justified that feeling on any facts. In an organic, it would have been a hunch or a gut feeling, but Two wasn\u2019t supposed to have either of those things. It was supposed to be an adaptive, intelligent learning machine \u2013 but one based on facts and equations, of cold numbers and logic \u2013 and nothing else.", "Two ran a new set of simulations, once again emulating the shift capabilities of a Compact battlecruiser. These took a handful of seconds. Most of them ended predictably. A few \u2013 a very few \u2013 did not. The AI focused on those, adjusting technical specifications, modifying crew responses, altering level of damage and more. It played with these variables, running fresh models, inventing, developing and intuiting its way through them, pairing machine speed and intellect with an almost organic outlook. It could have been nothing but an adaptive subroutine, emulating psychological and emotional actions in its foes. All of the Cerulean series had that capability. Usually, it was applied in psychological warfare or deception. This could simple have been a simple advanced refinement of those programs.", "It didn\u2019t feel that way, though.", "+anomaly+", "Finally, Cerulean Two had tilted the odds. The probability of a starship successfully navigating that warp route was no longer overwhelmingly suicidal. It would have taken days for the Enemy vessel to have run the same analysis, so either it had warped from here with its research incomplete and was in all likelihood dead, or\u2026", "\u2026or it had indeed been planning this from before it had jumped for this system.", "I know what you did.

Now, it had to take that risk.", "The equations still told Two to rejoin IKagge, but it knew it couldn\u2019t. It knew what its foe had done and where it was.", "Lakhesis deployed a courier, sending it back to Cerulean Eight as it began the necessary modifications to its shift systems. The work would take several hours, but once it was prepared it would be able to continue its pursuit of the Enemy vessel.

Eight days, six reversions, shipwide damage and more than five hundred casualties; sixty-seven of those serious. There\u2019d been six fatalities and that number was likely to increase. That was the price of Vamn\u2019s decision to take Ecanok\u2019s Blade through a shockspace corridor riddled with gravitational eddies, unexpected energy cascades, radiation surges and all the unpleasant, deadly phenomena associated with travel through the other realm.", "It was a high price, but it was far lighter than he\u2019d expected to pay. His ship and crew had performed exemplarily. The Writ said no ship had any business whatsoever shocking through that kind of Black-touched route. Then again, The Writ also said that only idiots ventured into a stellar nursery without being damn sure of the astrography to begin with.", "By even the most strained logic and rational analysis, what Vamn and Ecanok\u2019s Blade had done had been tantamount to an attempted mass suicide. They\u2019d made it, though. Countless other souls who\u2019d challenged shockspace under far less adverse conditions had perished, but they had survived. If that wasn\u2019t proof of the Triarchs\u2019 blessings \u2013 or at least Fortune\u2019s kindness \u2013 Vamn couldn\u2019t have said what was. There was a very old saying from his people\u2019s history: the gods favoured the bold. He wouldn\u2019t go so far as to ascribe any divinity to their survival, but today more than any other he felt the truth of those words. This mission would succeed.", "First, though\u2026 first, some maintenance was in order. Vamn had ordered Ecanok\u2019s Blade into the system in search of a place where they could make the necessary repairs without fear of ambush. The shock systems were the first priority. Until those were operational again, the battlecruiser wouldn\u2019t be going anywhere. Not without killing everyone this time.", "And maybe once those repairs are made, my chief engineer will speak to me again, Vamn thought with a chuckle. He\u2019d never seen an apoplectic Builder before Sem-Trilln-Com had been briefed on his leader\u2019s intent. The Faithful Prime was already nursing a grudge over what Vamn had done to the ship. Sending Ecanok\u2019s Blade through these briars hadn\u2019t done the vessel, its crew or the faithful\u2019s opinion of his leader any favours. \u201cThat may be an exaggeration,\u201d Vamn said to himself as he turned his clockwork robot around on a pedestal. He had most of the inner workings complete. It would be done soon. Then he\u2019d have to start something else.", "It wasn\u2019t as if Sem-Trilln-Com was actually sulking or anything as unprofessional as that, but the Builder had taken pains to point out exactly what the mechanical cost of Vamn\u2019s decisions was. Perhaps a little more ardently than he needed to, but Sem-Trilln-Com was attached to this ship. The Tribune had been told early in his career to never have a chief engineer who didn\u2019t love their vessel, and he\u2019d never found cause to question that. The Faithful Prime would get Ecanok\u2019s Blade operational again. Everything after that was up to Vamn.", "Limping its way across Path 5, Ecanok\u2019s Blade was easy prey. Every hour that the lamed battlecruiser was in open space was one in which the knots in Vamn\u2019s liver grew tighter and colder. He could almost feel the hostile gaze of machine eyes watching him. It was possible that Path 5 wasn\u2019t host to enemy augur platforms. It was also possible that the heavens might part like a great sea, creating a clear path for Ecanok\u2019s Blade into the nebula. Even with the success of Vamn\u2019s stratagem, he knew that their time here was limited, but every moment that they had without their stalking shadows was one that brought them closer to success.", "Vamn licked his lips. His mouth felt dry. He\u2019d gambled everything on this decision. If Gravestone responded faster than he believed they would, if they found his ship like this\u2026 well. There wasn\u2019t any point in thinking about it because the outcome would be obvious. He still believed that he could defeat one of them, but two\u2026 yes, \u2018obvious\u2019 was the right word.", "Despite that, Vamn ordered his crew to drill relentlessly. Most of the simulations ended the way he expected them to. Still, it seasoned his crew and gave them a better understanding of their options for when the next battle came. \u201cNot if,\u201d Vamn said his robot. \u201cWe\u2019ve evaded them for the moment, but they have more than those two ships.\u201d He didn\u2019t know what lay ahead, but his mission was incomplete and his duty unfinished.", "He finished his hobby work for the morning, donned his uniform and took his place on the bridge.

He didn\u2019t like this. He didn\u2019t trust this. Nothing was what it seemed in the Black Veil. In Husk, a field of dead starships had come alive and formed the Skinweaver. In Cemetery, what they\u2019d thought had been a corrupted Chariot had been a decoy. Their entire mission had drawn them far from known space and Gravestone had taken advantage of that distraction. He remembered just how much he hated this nebula.", "Moments, then minutes passed. The orders went out, the drones moved closer to the wreck and finally reported back. \u201cIt\u2019s one of ours,\u201d Scopes reported. \u201cLight cruiser. Heavily damaged by a shockpoint.

Largely because it didn\u2019t think of itself at all. That could change, though.", "Despite its youth, Eight\u2019s neural network and heuristic systems were developing beyond their original parameters. Cerulean Two had shared its data, its records and its experiences with all of its siblings. They\u2019d seen through its sensors, felt the strike of weapons against its hull as if it were their own and their minds had begun to alter just as its had. The process was slower, for although Two\u2019s experiences were theirs, it wasn\u2019t quite the same as going through the events themselves. Two was the most different of all its siblings, but the other eight Ceruleans followed the same path.", "As it waited for its counterpart to return, Cerulean Eight ruminated. It conducted astrographic surveys of the surrounding system, used telescopes and sensors to map star patterns to update and refine local navigational data, measured background radiation and gravitational fluctuations, re-analyzed previous encounters with the Enemy warship and conducted new simulations for future encounters. While it did all that and more, Cerulean Eight also considered the matter of Two.", "Even Eight could see that its counterpart had changed. Two had made jumps of logic in the past, but none as severe as those over the last few days. Cerulean Eight had requested, and received, diagnostics of its sibling\u2019s function systems. Everything appeared to be in order, but Eight knew Two was different. Its thought processes, its responses, its\u2026 there was no word to describe it, but Two felt different. The shape of its mind, the texture of it\u2026 all changing. Eight didn\u2019t know what that meant. It didn\u2019t seem to have impeded Lakhesis\u2019s operations; indeed, it seemed to have made the Fate more efficient\u2026 but Eight was still cautious. It also felt twinges of sensations it couldn\u2019t properly define within its own processes, also uncertain of what they meant for it. The risk of rampancy and network degradation was a high one. If it had been more self-aware, Eight would have preferred its current existence to mental degeneration and insanity.", "In the end though, that choice might not be Eight\u2019s to make. Its mind, just as Cerulean Two\u2019s and those of the rest of its siblings, was moving in a direction that it could neither foresee nor understand. It tried, but each time ended inconclusively and it focused more on its current mission. It didn\u2019t like the feeling of not knowing and it retreated to matters more familiar, more concrete and more easily solved.", "So IKagge lay in predatory silence, waiting expectantly for its Enemy to return. It repaired, it analyzed, it ran calculations and it evaluated options and possibilities. With every new connection its mind made, another grain of sand slipped free from a mountaintop.", "More time passed, and Cerulean Eight found itself growing restless \u2013 as restless as it was possible for the AI to feel. It had predicted the Enemy vessel\u2019s return to this system, but by now more even its most conservative time estimates had been exceeded.

It knew \u2013 posited rather, though there was no apt descriptor \u2013 what the Enemy had done. The exact mechanics of that decision \u2013 how the foe intended to make that possible \u2013 were still being puzzled out by Eight\u2019s inquisitive intellect, but the AI was certain now that it and Lakhesis had been tricked.", "It was the following decisions that stopped IKagge where it was. The Enemy\u2019s destination would be the next system along the transit line. If it survived. That it wouldn\u2019t was too big a risk to leave to chance. It would have to be intercepted. But there were other variables in play. What if Cerulean Eight had determined incorrectly, and the foe was merely delayed? If it abandoned this position, it could allow the Enemy to escape \u2013 exactly what it was trying to prevent. What if this was developing rampancy, and its initial analysis was the correct one?", "A courier from Lakhesis, badly damaged from a hard warp jump, settled the issue. Two had reached the same conclusion, but days earlier.

One ship. They\u2019d split up to come after him, but he didn\u2019t yet know which one he was facing. If it was the Scar, he\u2019d find out sooner than missile range. If it was the Cicatrix\u2026 he\u2019d have more of a chance. The identity of his enemy was immaterial, though. No matter who his foe was, he wanted to kill it.", "His sister was not his sister. Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro had been given very specific security briefings, medical data and analysis algorithms. Gravestone\u2019s horrors weren\u2019t limited to turning captured ships against their enemy. They did worse.", "There were clusters of nanites in Treshu\u2019s brain. All of the personnel recovered from Oathcurser\u2019s Bane were similarly infected. Everyone who\u2019d ever encountered Gravestone\u2019s monstrosities in person was at risk of this\u2026 this perversion. The soulless, blasphemous monsters who commanded those ships would turn the flesh and bodies of sapients against their kin. The Devoured had used this tactic, as had the Valthus fleets corrupted by them. The Eternity had been another, as was Gravestone now. Grateful heirs to a hideous tradition.", "Nanoweapons had been banned for use by the Compact for more than three thousand years. It was one of the few points of common accord the Compact had with the Principality. Other star nations followed that declaration too \u2013 out of self-interest and self-preservation, if nothing else. Neither the Compact nor the Principality would stand by and allow any other power to delve into those fields. Gravestone hadn\u2019t signed those accords, nor was the might of the Space Force or the Argosy sufficient to cow its people from pursuing these abominations. They reveled in this\u2026 this obscenity.", "Vamn had thought himself lucky, but now he knew Fortune had played him again. He hadn\u2019t recovered his sister at all. He\u2019d only reclaimed her and fifteen other walking corpses.", "Antj\u2019sa hadn\u2019t tiptoed around the issue. The physician was preparing a regime to counteract the hostile nanites, but the prognosis wasn\u2019t good. Gravestone\u2019s infestations were extremely difficult to remove and as often as not the host died with them. Of the handful that survived, there was always lingering neurological or physical damage. Vamn took a slow breath, calling up a feed from the security cameras in the survivors\u2019 quarantine area. He cycled through the views. Some of the men and women there were sleeping. Others were reading. A few were playing cards. Treshu was talking with one of her subordinates. The way she leaned against the way, the mannerisms, the way she emphasized a point with her hands\u2026 it was just like she used to act. But it wasn\u2019t her. There was something inside her. He didn\u2019t even know if when he talked to her, it was really her or just the machines puppeting her body.", "Which was worse, he wondered. Was it to that think you were yourself? To believe that you were in control, that anyone who said otherwise was wrong or paranoid, only to learn that you were wrong? Or was it worse to know what had happened to you, to be caged and screaming inside your own mind as your memories were plundered and something that wore your face smiled and spoke to family and friends and all you had was the hope that they noticed?", "Antj\u2019sa had told him that the colonies weren\u2019t active, but she couldn\u2019t tell him whether that meant his sister was looking out at him, or if the machines had already taken control and didn\u2019t need to spread any further. No one had told the survivors. As far as they knew, they had a clean bill of health. This was standard protocol within the execution force, perhaps a little more stringent than that, but understandable given the circumstances.", "Gravestone\u2019s infections had failsafes. If they became aware that they\u2019d been compromised, their hosts became violently homicidal or self-destructive, causing as much harm as possible before they were incapacitated or killed. Vamn had quietly added security to the deck. He\u2019d also avoided talking to his sister for long. She knew him too well, and whatever was inside her might have access to those memories and sense the unease behind his eyes.", "He didn\u2019t pray, had never prayed, but if he were of the mind to start, it would be for the soul of his sister and all the other survivors of Oathcurser\u2019s Bane. Rage, binding and dark radiated through his being. One enemy warship. He didn\u2019t care what it was. He would fight it, and he would kill it. Even if Ecanok\u2019s Blade\u2019s shock systems were working, there would be no more running. He\u2019d been chased too long, seen too many horrors, sacrificed too much of his ship and his crew. Here, now, there was only one thing more he needed of them.", "They would kill that monstrosity. It was time to take something from Gravestone, and in less than a day he\u2019d finally have that chance.", "No more running, Vamn vowed in the darkest pits of his soul. No more running for any of us.", "~", "The Enemy vessel was making no effort at subtlety. Its course was clear, and it was accelerating to combat thrust as it closed with IKagge. Cerulean Eight had already deployed a shell of sensor drones to extend its sense horizon. With luck, it might even be able to get some in close enough to the hostile that if it tried to warp out, IKagge could follow it again. There was no place it could run that Eight, its siblings or the Fleet wouldn\u2019t be able to find it.", "Eight didn\u2019t want to merely track the alien, though \u2013 it wanted to kill it.", "A brief sensation akin to uncertainty touched Eight\u2019s analytical processes. Lakhesis wasn\u2019t here. Despite its lighter armament, IKagge\u2019s technological superiority made it a close match for a Compact battlecruiser, but the odds of success were much greater with two strike cruisers working in tandem.", "As the distance closed, Eight continued to run tactical simulations. The damage to its ship-self\u2019s prow was an obvious weak point. The Enemy vessel was both larger and had a far heavier weight of fire than IKagge, with correspondingly larger reserves. The Fleet\u2019s strike cruisers had been designed for alpha strikes \u2013 doing so much damage fast enough that the enemy was either destroyed outright, or no longer capable of resistance. Without resupply and repairs, lack of ordnance and accumulating damage would force them to withdraw. If the battlecruiser could survive long enough, it would be able to outlast IKagge. That was an unpleasant outcome, and one Cerulean Eight endeavoured to avoid.", "Where the Coyote outstripped its foe was in quality over quantity; it accelerated and changed vector far faster, was much more maneuverable, its shields were as strong as its foe\u2019s and though its armour was thinner, it was pound for pound more resistant to damage and penetrating hits than the Compact\u2019s own battle steel. Furthermore, the strike cruiser\u2019s electronic warfare utterly outclassed the alien warship and while its weapons were fewer, they were more accurate with higher individual damage output. All of these put IKagge several generations ahead of the Enemy\u2019s forces and made even the smallest of the Fleet\u2019s vessels capable of threatening warships many times their size.", "The Enemy knew this; it would attempt to get into its own missile envelope as quickly as possible. As part of the nebula\u2019s invading force, it would also be expecting the Fleet\u2019s cyberwarfare. Unlike the defenders at Galhemna, this vessel would have safeguards to prevent or reduce the damage of Eight\u2019s incursions. They would almost certainly seek to close into energy range; that was where IKagge was at its greatest disadvantage. Its own batteries were dangerous in their own right, but they were lighter and fewer than those of a Fate.", "Eight\u2019s strategy would be to hold the opposing vessel at range for a missile duel, though the odds of killing the Enemy battlecruiser solely with missiles were only moderate. In all likelihood IKagge would have to bring its foe into energy range to finish it off. The order of operations was therefore simple: engage the Enemy with long-range fire. When its capabilities were sufficiently degraded, close and kill. A simple plan. Simple to conceive of, at least. Theory was all well and good, until it came time to put that into practice.", "IKagge\u2019s course shifted, and it turned away from the alien. If words could be put to the sensations in its mind, they would be this: let\u2019s see how much you want to chase me.", "~", "\u201cOf course,\u201d Vamn said to himself as the changing light codes registered on the main display. The enemy was avoiding a head-on intercept. How discourteous. He was facing the Cicatrix, then. The Scar would want keep its prow towards Ecanok\u2019s Blade to ensure that its siege weapon would be brought to bear. He felt a fire in his liver, but he tempered that rush of excitement.", "Despite its size, the lighter vessel was still one of Gravestone\u2019s; their bastard reclaimed hulls were dangerous enough. This was one of their trueborn, and a deadly foe. He wasn\u2019t seeing a craven or frightened response, but a considered one. His opposite knew what they were about and what he was, too. Ecanok\u2019s Blade\u2019s best chance would be to push through the longer range of its opponent and enter its own envelope, where its greater weight of fire would compensate for the superior accuracy and lethality of the Cicatrix. If he could be held at arm\u2019s length, he could be whittled down enough that it wouldn\u2019t fear closing with him.", "Both ships were still many AU away from each other. This was only the opening stages of the engagement, where each side jockeyed for position as the distance closed. The Cicatrix was moving through open space, a stance that favoured its longer range. He had one advantage over his opponent, though. He might want \u2013 and want very badly \u2013 to kill them, but they needed to kill him. They couldn\u2019t risk him escaping yet again and that was a weakness he intended to exploit.", "\u201cAdjust course,\u201d Vamn ordered. \u201cShift us towards the seventh planet.\u201d It was a gas world with eighty-three moons and large rings, replete with regions to break up lines of fire. It would limit his own as well \u2013 if he reached it. Whether he did or did not, he would force his enemy to react to him rather than rushing obligingly into their guns.", "The battlecruiser came about as if it had all the time in the universe, but Vamn knew that that wasn\u2019t the case at all. Void battles could take hours \u2013 often days, or even longer as fleets and ships feinted and maneuvered around each other, sometimes widening the distance, sometimes closing it, but every tick of the clock brought the inevitable one step closer. Today was no exception.", "Vamn counted each minute as it passed. Finally, another inevitability arrived. He opened a comm line to the quarantine section. He promised he\u2019d call. He still held out hope that his sister could be saved. That was what he told himself to choke back the rage and keep his voice even and his face composed when he talked to her. He had to believe that.", "I also believe, he thought as he was routed to the quarantine deck. That I\u2019m going to make them pay for what they\u2019ve done. Not just to you, but to everyone.", "The time whittled away, and the greater inevitable crept closer.", "~", "The hostile vessel banked away from IKagge, turning towards a blue-green world three times the size of Sol\u2019s Saturn. Cerulean Eight considered the possibility that this was an attempt to disengage, but quickly all but dismissed it. The Enemy had shown clear aggression, but now that Eight was refusing to accept a closing engagement, it was trying a different tack. The battlecruiser was willing to enter a closing engagement with IKagge, not a stern chase. They knew what to expect of the Fleet, and this alien commander in particular knew how vital his destruction was. He was using himself as bait to draw IKagge back towards him.", "It could even work. With so many celestial bodies in that region, the Enemy might be able to find a libration point stable enough to warp out, or it could break up IKagge\u2019s sight lines, using asteroids and moons for shelter from long-ranged fire. Letting the alien warship get into the planet\u2019s orbital tracks was a non-optimal outcome.", "Fortunately, the solution was an easy one.", "~", "The Cicatrix was coming back, and it was accelerating hard. Vamn\u2019s four eyes narrowed as he looked at the readouts. He couldn\u2019t understand how any living crew could survive that many gravities of thrust, not over more than a handful of hours. Perhaps they believed only intermittent burns were all they needed. Or perhaps\u2026 maybe the rumours about Gravestone are true. When we board that wreck, will we find corpses, or hard-wired biological components?", "Vamn pushed those grim thoughts away. Those musings took second place to the enemy\u2019s shift in tactics. The smaller warship was going to overtake him, reaching the planet before Ecanok\u2019s Blade. Current estimates put him in its missile envelope twelve million kilometers from the outermost of the gas world\u2019s moons \u2013 a tiny, worthless lump of rock that offered no cover whatsoever. Despite that, Vamn\u2019s lips curled back from his teeth ever so slightly. To keep him out of the planet\u2019s orbital tracks, Gravestone would need to adapt its tactics. It would have to face him instead of withdrawing and flaying him from range. He remembered what had happened to Unspoken Right, but he would not make the same mistakes\u2026 and he was not facing a Scar. How much that would actually matter would become apparent soon.", "Augurs were picking up increased movement in the area; small drive wakes and minute energy signatures. The Cicatrix\u2019s own drones. More than it needed for a recon shell. Attack units, then. They\u2019d hold off until the ships engaged one another and then swarm Ecanok\u2019s Blade. Normally, unless they were deployed in substantial numbers, hunter-killers were little more than a distraction. Compared to a starship, drones carried minimal defences and weapons, small reactors and slow-charging weaponry. Even Gravestone\u2019s automatons didn\u2019t break that mold, though they were far more dangerous a distraction than even the Jackals\u2019 designs. He didn\u2019t like the idea of them striking at his flanks or rear.", "He had some of his own \u2013 probably more than his opponent \u2013 but he knew how outclassed they were. Regardless, he didn\u2019t intend to hold back. Now was not the time, though. That moment was coming. In less than half a day, it would be here. Kill the Cicatrix. Escape. Finish the survey. Inform Local Command. Bring Gravestone to its knees and strike the head from its body. That was his responsibility, but beyond that there was something else.", "Revenge. The dark, whispering seed in his core cracked and began to branch out, crawling tendrils running through his mind. Rather than suppress it or push it away, he let it spread, welcoming those thoughts and adding them to the hate he already felt.", "~", "IKagge\u2019s tactical situation was suboptimal. It had intended to hold the Enemy warship at arm\u2019s length and wear it down. Regrettably, the alien warship was disinclined to meekly acquiesce to that intention. Cerulean Eight had calculated no other outcome, though. Its organic opposite was seeking a confrontation, but one that it intended to make on its terms, using the necessity of its own termination to force Eight\u2019s hand.", "The flicker of not-quite thoughts, stillborn emotions and impressions that flitted through Cerulean Eight\u2019s mind could be approximated as two words. How inconsiderate.", "Hundreds of simulations ran as Eight considered its options. This far from direct engagement, its options were limited. Any maneuvers it made would be matched or countered by the hostile vessel. The Enemy\u2019s goal was to reach the planet before IKagge could intercept it. The means by which it could do so seemed straightforward, but Eight suspected otherwise. The Enemy battlecruiser\u2019s acceleration curve didn\u2019t match previous observations. There was a small but significant discrepancy there. It could have been nothing; the result of false sensor returns caused by jamming and distance, but Eight didn\u2019t believe so.", "There were faint \u2013 nearly imperceptible \u2013 fluctuations in its engine wake. Its distortion drive was damaged. Not enough to impede normal operations, but enough to make strenuous operations difficult or dangerous, like a runner with a broken leg that had only recently healed. More enticing than the sublight damage was the other secret IKagge\u2019s sensors pried out of its enemy\u2019s grip. The battlecruiser\u2019s shock drive was offline, a residual injury from its course through the nebula.", "If it had been capable of thinking in metaphors, Cerulean Eight\u2019s thoughts would have been simple: blood was in the water. Despite the damage the Enemy had suffered, IKagge still bore its own wounds from the clashes with the alien warship. The hundred and fifty-meter chasm the Enemy\u2019s missiles had cut into its starboard prow made it vulnerable, but this was the best chance to destroy the alien intruder. If Eight held back, the odds of losing contact with the Enemy increased, as did the chances of its escape.", "The odds would indeed be better with two ships, but until Lakhesis returned, this battle was IKagge\u2019s. It would be tricky, but not impossible. It was built to overcome brute force with ruthless \u00e9lan. Something that might be resolve, formed from cold calculations and the distaste of unwelcome outcomes, hardened in Cerulean Eight, its mind focused on the coming conflict and the best way to achieve its enemy\u2019s destruction.", "Three hours later, IKagge\u2019s sensors detected the formation of a warp point. As the distant telemetry resolved itself, a new sensation curled through the molecular circuitry of Eight\u2019s mind. In an organic, it might have been a smile.", "~", "It was an axiom in the Space Force that bad news always came in the middle of the night. Today, it arrived in the closing minutes of the afternoon. A second shockpoint had been detected two billion kilometers away. Another cruiser-sized portal, but that assumption was just that: an assumption. It could have been anything. Ecanok\u2019s Blade didn\u2019t have any drones that far out and the scope readings were hashed by gravitic backwash and hostile ECM. Vamn didn\u2019t need his ship\u2019s augurs to tell him who it was, though. Their other old friend had come to call.", "At conventional thrust, it was more than ten hours out. With what he\u2019d observed from these ships, it would be on him within seven hours. He\u2019d enter firing range of the Cicatrix inside five. A difference of two hours, both an eternity and no time at all. He couldn\u2019t run. That wasn\u2019t his pride talking; the enemy scope drones were too many and too close. If he attempted to shock through a libration point, they\u2019d pull his course. The chase would start all over again. To break contact, he still had to kill the Cicatrix and shock out before the Scar could range on him.", "Vamn could feel his crew\u2019s unease. \u201cNothing about our situation has changed,\u201d he told them. \u201cWe must still fight our way past the enemy. Our priorities remain the same. Attend to your duties, focus on your tasks. We are soldiers of the Compact of Species. We are the Triarchs\u2019 sword and we have been sheathed for too long. Now, we are drawn and we will strike.\u201d", "He meant every word. Nothing about the situation had changed. He simply had less time than he\u2019d assumed. The Tribune opened a channel to engineering. \u201cFaithful Prime,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease tell me we will have shock capability within the next seven hours.\u201d", "\u201cSeven hours?\u201d Sem-Trilln-Com asked incredulously. \u201cSeven hours? No. Not possible. Damage too widespread. Systems too unstable. No, time frame is far too short. Insufficient.\u201d", "\u201cIt will have to be,\u201d Vamn said quietly. \u201cOr we will all die.\u201d", "There was a brief pause. \u201cSix hours,\u201d the Builder vowed. \u201cOne shock. Short range. Six hours. Cannot guarantee more. Will do our best, but six hours. No less. Short range, prime. Much too risky for anything greater. Six hours, yes.\u201d", "\u201cThank you, Faithful.\u201d", "\u201cDo not thank yet. Ship still intact. After six hours and we survive, then you can thank. Will expect it if not dead.\u201d The engineer closed the line. Vamn smiled, a graveyard chuckle eking out of his lips. If they did survive the next six hours, he would indeed owe his chief engineer and every other soul onboard a great debt.", "If they survived. His task was to make that potential outcome a reality, and he would. His duty and his pride demanded nothing else.", "~", "Lakhesis had arrived later than Cerulean Two had anticipated. The warp route had been more hazardous than projections indicated and its arrival had been delayed more than half a day. Now that it was here, Two felt a brief flash of vindication. The Enemy had indeed followed through on its intuitive guess, counting through the dangerous warp route to try and evade pursuit. Their gambit had failed. Two had seen through it\u2026", "\u2026and surprising the AI, so had Eight. IKagge was here, too. The Coyote was moving to engage the Enemy battlecruiser. Two immediately blurted a coded transmission to its comrade. As it waited for a response, it brought its reactor up and accelerated towards the alien warship.", "Minutes, then hours passed. Lakhesis\u2019s sensor drones pushed out, meeting the stealthed platforms here as well as IKagge\u2019s own. Datalinks whispered to each other, feeding that data back to the Fate. Two considered what it was seeing, a predatory sensation to its observations.", "The battlecruiser was lamed. Its journey had not been nearly as easy \u2013 and that was being liberal with the term \u2013 as Lakhesis\u2019s. Signal leakage pointed at systemwide damage. How much that translated to combat impairment was uncertain. None of the automatons had gotten close enough to make that kind of analysis. Compact warships were highly durable with exceptionally robust systems and multiple redundancies. They could fight with minimal to moderate loss of effectiveness after suffering what would otherwise be grievous or even crippling injuries.", "Its belligerent stance spoke to the accuracy of Two\u2019s psychological evaluations of its commander\u2026 and suggested that its shift systems were offline. It was trying to buy time for repairs, hoping to disable or destroy IKagge in the doing.", "You can\u2019t escape this time, purred through Cerulean Two\u2019s mind as it raced towards its enemy. But you don\u2019t want to, do you? You think you have a chance against IKagge. Two pushed its engines harder. It would arrive too late to do anything, though. The AI knew what its sibling\u2019s capabilities were, and it knew what the Enemy\u2019s were. It didn\u2019t like the variables here. It wanted to help IKagge, but all it could do was watch.", "If IKagge could keep the Enemy pinned, then Lakhesis could deal the death blow. Two had killed one battlecruiser already. Tearing a second one apart would\u2026", "\u2026it would\u2026", "+it would feel good+", "I\u2019m coming, the thought echoed through Two\u2019s mind. I\u2019m coming.", "~", "Well, Vamn thought as he beheld the latest scope data. No one has ever accused our enemy of stupidity. It would have been nice if Gravestone were arrogant and complacent, but Vamn knew full well that nature weeded such officers and leaders out of the gene pool with all the efficiency of carin packs culling sick and weak prey. Sometimes you could hide from it with political patronage, easy assignments or simple luck in the opponents you faced, but Fortune\u2019s protection was fleeting and mercurial. When that beneficence expired, all you had left was skill.", "The Cicatrix was altering its course. If it had stayed on its previous vector, it would have eventually crossed his prow. Such actions traditionally favoured vessels in that position \u2013 they could focus their broadsides much more tightly, while the closing ship only had its prow guns and whatever dorsal/ventral emplacements could be brought to bear. This situation was different, though. The Cicatrix didn\u2019t want Ecanok\u2019s Blade on a head-on course; the battlecruiser would push through to its own attack range far too quickly. As advanced as it was, the Gravestone warship was facing a much larger vessel that had already hurt it and could do so again.", "Generations beyond us, but still not quite out of reach, are you? Vamn watched his foe\u2019s course change finalize. It was curling towards him on a parallel vector. Too far away to surprise with a sudden lunge or vector change, it would steadily close the distance until it reached its missile range, keeping to the outer edges of his own. It would be hours before scopes could confirm any of that, but Vamn didn\u2019t need to be told what his enemy was doing. He knew what it intended; it would use missiles as it closed and passed his port flank and then come up behind him, either to rake another facing with fire, or sidle itself into his engine wake.", "The opening hours of a void battle were always like this. Move and counter-move. No surprises. Not at these ranges. Not until both sides were committed, the missiles began to fly and the guns began to fire. This was a challenge. He was the one forced to respond now.", "He could turn towards it, cutting inside its arc and putting Ecanok\u2019s Blade once more on a least-time intercept, but that would take him away from the planet, back to the Cicatrix\u2019s preferred battleground. If he veered away, he was letting himself be herded like an alpaq down the gravity well. It would buy him some more time, but at the cost of letting the Cicatrix and Scar link up once again. He could remain on-course and let his enemy set the tone for the battle, or he could rush towards cover, accelerating further, cutting down maneuvering response and outpacing his scope platforms. There was no good option, and Gravestone knew that.", "\u201cNot as simple as we would have hoped, is it?\u201d Vamn asked aloud, stroking his chin.", "\u201cHe\u2019s looking to bait us,\u201d Renilip said with certainty. \u201cMake us pull towards him and shorten the distance between us and the Scar. If he can\u2019t do that, he wants to try and push us down the system.\u201d", "The leader nodded. His first officer\u2019s summation was succinct. Just as he already had, he knew that his opposite had considered those options. The Cicatrix would be too happy to see either come to fruition, but the enemy\u2019s decision felt\u2026 colder than this. \u201cThey\u2019re testing us,\u201d he voiced his earlier thoughts. \u201cTheir acceleration dropped.\u201d Some had voiced the opinion that this was due to physiological strain on the crew. He didn\u2019t agree. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting to see how we\u2019ll respond.\u201d", "Four hours left. Four hours in which to kill this thing and escape the Scar. Rearguard scopes were showing that it was still accelerating beyond safe levels for any known species. Either its leader was disregarding the safety of his crew to a level that even Vamn would have balked at\u2026 or\u2026", "\u2018Or\u2019, indeed.", "Vamn studied the plot, his lips tight, speaking with his senior officers. Ecanok\u2019s Blade\u2019s damage wasn\u2019t limited to its shock systems. Pushing the distortion drive more than they already were had a very real chance of causing a critical burnout of at least one engine, and that was the best-case scenario for a drive system failure. Sem-Trilln-Com and his engineering crews had been working for days with only the barest rest. Ecanok\u2019s Blade was not crippled, but it still required a great deal of attention. The less strain Vamn put on the ship, the faster the work would go and the greater their odds of victory.", "But by the same token, the less we dance for our enemy\u2019s music increases our odds as well. \u201cI will owe the faithful prime another very sincere apology,\u201d he said at last. He raised his gaze to meet his officers\u2019 eyes, \u201cbut I will not play my enemy\u2019s game. Increase acceleration. Get us into those moons.\u201d", "Ecanok\u2019s Blade obeyed. Vamn could feel his ship\u2019s pain. The vibration of the engines was sharper, just on the cusp of audibility. It felt strained, like the keening of a wounded but loyal steed. Two and a half kilometers of starship, millions upon millions of tonnes were suffering because of him. Another price, another gamble.", "Minutes passed. Finally, the Cicatrix saw what Ecanok\u2019s Blade was doing. With insulting ease, it came back around, its acceleration jumping back up. Just as he\u2019d expected. It didn\u2019t want him getting to the planet. \u201cPush as hard as you can,\u201d he told his helm crew. \u201cBut get us there before they get to us.\u201d He returned to his throne, studying sensor readouts and watching as his foe closed.", "No, there were very little surprises to be had this early in the dance. Once he and Gravestone were past the point of no return\u2026 then and only then would Fortune truly begin her games. Then, and only then would he find vindication.

Two-thirds of Vamn\u2019s outermost scope drones went off-line within twelve minutes of each other as heretofore unseen hunter-killers emerged from their shrouds and shot the Compact drones out of the sky, tearing wide holes in the battlecruiser\u2019s scope coverage.", "Coordinating that many strikes over that great a distance and that small a window was impressive. Accompanying the plucking of the battlecruiser\u2019s recon shell came the sudden fracture of the Cicatrix from a single, muddled signature into a barrage of static, scope echoes and contradictory range reports, as the Black-touched strike cruiser began spewing jamming signals and deploying ECM platforms that shredded Ecanok\u2019s Blade\u2019s scope returns.", "Stealth in space was difficult, but not unheard of. Every warship was built to produce as little \u2013 and emit even less \u2013 waste heat as possible. Distortion drives could be tracked, but not to the same extent that primitive torchships or reaction drives, with strict emissions control and shrouding technology making it even more difficult to locate a vessel that was trying not to be found.", "During battle, with screens online, active maneuvering and reactors fully functional, it was far harder \u2013 next to impossible \u2013 for a vessel to conceal its presence. Instead, modern warships used static clouds, gravitic pulses, thermal bafflers and EM signature replicators to obfuscate their true position, course and speed. If an enemy locked onto a scope echo instead of the actual ship, its missiles might hare off into nothing and its guns might fill empty space with fury while leaving the true target untouched. As the distance between combatants dwindled, it became easier to determine what was real and what wasn\u2019t \u2013 another reason why energy duels were so deadly \u2013 but at long range, or against an enemy as adept at deception as Gravestone, it was all too easy to achieve nothing with entire salvos.", "Vamn\u2019s lips drew back from his teeth. In amongst all the hash and distorted readings his augurs were reporting there were now several fractured and faint possible returns, each one as likely as the others. If his drones there had still been operational, he would have been able to get better reads, narrowing the possibilities further. Missile drives lit up the plot next, their ignition giving no indication to which potential contact had launched them, denying him even that. Hundreds of drive signatures, all launched at forty million kilometers, a range he couldn\u2019t hope to match. He could only endure, so he would.", "The Tribune snapped orders to his crew. They were ready. Battle was joined.", "~", "In addition to their dorsal, ventral, prow and aft mounts, each Fate-class strike cruiser carried 54 missile tubes per broadside. Ordnance-heavy Furies were equipped with 72. Coyote-class strike cruisers like IKagge itself carried 63 on each flank. As it closed with the Enemy, Cerulean Eight rolled its ship-self, launching from one facing and reloading as it brought another to bear, deploying two double broadsides in short order. Depending on how close to the target they were at detonation, each warhead carried a payload of up to a thousand megatons. IKagge had just deployed enough firepower to scourge an entire world, but it wasn\u2019t enough to kill its foe. Still, it was only the first of what Cerulean Eight was offering to its enemy.", "~", "Nearly three hundred missiles. Vamn\u2019s jaw tightened. A salvo that heavy should have overwhelmed a ship of that size\u2019s ability to coordinate and direct the warheads in-flight. Most of them would be reliant on their own scopes and computer systems, bereft of in-flight support. None of these missiles appeared to show any signs of degradation from an overburdened command net, but he would have been surprised if they had. Whatever Gravestone\u2019s upper limit for command and control might be, he\u2019d yet to encounter an instance in which they\u2019d overreached themselves.", "His own hunter-killers swept into the projected path of the incoming weapons, ready to intercept as many as they could. Coming to meet them were more than a score of Gravestone\u2019s own automatons, intending to clear the path for the missiles. That battle would be fought entirely between machines, both sides too far from their host vessels for direct control.", "Vamn\u2019s lips twitched in a slightly amused smirk of distaste. He\u2019d never before cared to consider such things, but Gravestone\u2019s usage \u2013 reliance, rather \u2013 of drone ships and automata brought such thoughts to the forefront of his mind. The Compact had learned long ago not to delve too deeply into the creation of synthetic intelligences. Even the Jackals knew better than to do more than dabble in that realm. To do what they did, Gravestone was either shockingly na\u00efve\u2026 or corrupted. To fight them was to look upon a people who willingly tread a path of damnation and self-destruction, just as the Devoured and the Valthus separatists had.", "Well, he considered, pushing those ruminations from his mind and re-focusing his attention on the tactical situation, the morass of angry orange hostile markers spilling towards his ship. It could be worse. The Cicatrix had expended its externally-mounted ordnance in the very first clash between it and Ecanok\u2019s Blade. They were only throwing almost everything they had at him.", "He\u2019d weathered that storm before. Not without injury, but his ship was a strong, loyal beast and his crew were the finest he\u2019d known. They only needed to weather it a little longer. Just a little longer, just until it became their turn to loose the thunder.", "Onwards, Vamn thought, the unofficial motto of the Space Force echoing in his head. Onwards, with sword unsheathed.", "~", "The Enemy vessel was centered in a roiling conflagration as IKagge\u2019s missiles struck at it, flares of incandescent plasma slashing across its path and into its shields. Though it possessed a handful of capital-scale missile tubes, most of the Coyote\u2019s weapons were smaller and lighter; standard anti-ship weaponry rather than the massive weapons carried by battlecruisers, battleships and dreadnoughts. The Enemy warship had both the mass and the space for that kind of weaponry, but such was the Fleet\u2019s technological advantage that even IKagge\u2019s missiles could match the payloads of its foe.", "Cerulean Eight deployed each salvo after the first with a surgeon\u2019s eye, using its sensors and recon drones to evaluate the damage of the previous launch, modifying targeting information on the fly, data-bursts going out to its warheads to adjust their maneuvers and attack patterns. As the missiles travelled to their target, distance between strike cruiser and weapon eventually became too great to benefit from this, but every bit of updated tactical information improved IKagge\u2019s odds of making a kill. Every injury it inflicted, every added strain upon its Enemy\u2019s shields added up.", "At the heart of the inferno, Ecanok\u2019s Blade raged in defiance of its torment, point defence lasers creating a hellish interlacing field of fire that shredded incoming warheads by the score. Counter-missiles darted from launch tubes and turrets, zigging and zagging through the battlecruiser\u2019s own kill zones on their way to their targets. Attack drones spiraled and curled through space, alien machines diving on the helpless missiles as Ikagge\u2019s own units fought them back.", "+launch+ the drumbeat pounded through Eight\u2019s neural network. Auto-loaders drew missiles from armoured magazines in the warship\u2019s core into their silos. Launch coils thrummed with power. Blast doors opened. Tiny apertures in IKagge\u2019s shields opened to allow the missiles out.  +launch+", "The Enemy\u2019s shields were a brilliant halo around the vessel, flashing bright with each strike they suffered, dimming as the attack abated only to turn incandescent once more as a fresh salvo slashed in, seemingly locked in the cycle of defence and repair\u2026 but each time the battlecruiser was struck, its shields had less time to recover, its generators working harder and its projectors struggling just a bit more to maintain those same shields.", "A lesser commander might have changed course under that bombardment, turning to face IKagge and trying to close the distance to bring their own guns to bear as quickly as possible. Eight considered that a possibility, but a low one. True to its predictions, the Enemy didn\u2019t attempt such a maneuver. If they had, they would have died. IKagge would have baited them with the possibility of a close-range engagement, but it wouldn\u2019t have allowed that. Once the Enemy\u2019s course was irrevocable, the Coyote would have doubled back, continuing the missile exchange until it crippled its foe or Lakhesis arrived. Its alien counterpart was bold and aggressive, but not stupid.", "Instead, the Enemy\u2019s acceleration jumped, this time with a corresponding fluctuation in engine emissions. It was brief; only a few moments before it stabilized and the battlecruiser continued its flight, but it proved that the alien\u2019s sublight systems were damaged. What showed up as a minor instability in its drive wake had been the result of uncontrolled power surges that rolled through capacitors and inflicted moderate damage throughout thruster banks and engine systems. There would almost certainly have been casualties.", "A thought that didn\u2019t quite form tickled at the edges of Eight\u2019s consciousness.", "Good.", "~", "Ecanok\u2019s Blade threw everything it had into its screens and engines as it raced through the maelstrom towards the safety of the planet and the respite, however fleeting, it offered. The strike cruiser was measured in its launches, timing follow-on salvos to strike when the Compact warship was heavily engaged with a previous one, shipkilling warheads darting and weaving \u2013 dancing, really \u2013 in mockery how they should have acted. Missiles had no business acting as these ones did. They threaded their way through killzones, dodged drones and interceptors alike, driving in at Ecanok\u2019s Blade like the arrows of Oman Os himself.", "Sweating, harried engineers drew more and more power from Ecanok\u2019s Blade\u2019s raging heart and pulsing fusion reactors as their fellows struggled with the screen generators and projectors that had to bear the brunt of the assault, the strain pushing the battlecruiser\u2019s defences closer and closer to collapse. The screens couldn\u2019t be allowed to fail. Not yet. Not with that ship out there, waiting to slam another three hundred missiles into the battlecruiser\u2019s unprotected hull. Every soul aboard knew that and every soul fought to keep their enemy at bay just a little longer, and they paid the price for that. Overworked generators shrilled. Power conduits blazed, radiation and heat counts jumped to hazardous levels and ticked slowly higher.", "Vamn wondered how much longer his enemy\u2019s magazines would hold out. With all the skirmishes and running battles over the past few days, it had to be running low. Not low enough, he acknowledged as another sixty-odd missile drives hit the void, but his thoughts turned from darkness to vindictiveness as the distance between his ship and the enemy approached an invisible threshold. His lips curled back, baring his teeth in a primeval threat display. \u201cAs soon as we have range,\u201d he told Tactical. \u201cRoll and launch.\u201d", "Ecanok\u2019s Blade crossed that threshold and the battlecruiser spoke, giving voice to its commander\u2019s rage.", "~", "Cerulean Two watched its sibling\u2019s signal scatter and disappear under the detonations of dozens of Enemy missiles. It was briefly concerned, but it knew what a Coyote was capable of. That barrage and the following ones were survivable. In colloquial terms, it looked worse than it was.", "The Enemy ship wasn\u2019t holding back, though. It was firing almost as fast as it could, trying to drown IKagge in volume of fire. That \u2018almost\u2019 was key. While quantity was often its own quality, the Enemy weren\u2019t firing from blind panic or a forlorn hope of swamping IKagge\u2019s defences. They were taking the time to update their targeting profiles, adjust ECM and ECCM as they attempted to break through IKagge\u2019s jamming and get clearer shooting solutions. It would do them no good to simply vomit out broadside after broadside if all those missiles were unable to find their targets.", "The two warships were not just dueling with missiles, but with countermeasures, fighting to pierce each other\u2019s EW suites while preventing that being happening to themselves. That was a battle the Enemy could never win. The Fleet\u2019s EW systems were too advanced and only its most basic drone minds could be matched or out-paced by the responses of an organic crew. Cerulean Eight thought, adapted and responded faster than the aliens could ever hope to do and they were losing ground\u2026 but not fast enough. The closing range allowed for clearer returns for the Enemy sensors, visual tracking and slowed their systems\u2019 degradation against IKagge\u2019s ECM.", "Maintaining and even pushing its rate of acceleration despite risking engine failure, the Enemy warship was crossing the outer threshold of the planet\u2019s orbital tracks. This was sparse terrain and offered no cover at all. Even inside the denser regions closer to the great planet, safety wasn\u2019t guaranteed. Missiles could maneuver around asteroids and moons, but this required them to slow to avoid overshooting their target or arc around the obstruction. With a careful enough set-up, a foe could be pinned against the planet or moon it had attempted to use for shelter as missiles struck at it from all sides. Nemesis had done that very thing, ensnaring prey in a web of warheads racing across planetary terminators and bombarding the flanks of ships and squadrons that had thought themselves safe. If IKagge\u2019s missile stocks had been full, it might have been able to do the same.", "The battlecruiser took a hit through its straining shields and Two\u2019s predatory excitement jumped. The hellish plumes spawned from antiship warheads were tight cones directed towards their target, so almost nothing of the detonation was wasted with omnidirectional blasts. Despite that, missile warheads were much less focused than beam weapons. In a missile duel you had to batter your enemy\u2019s shields down before you could strike at the hull, but when shields were under enough strain and a missile detonated just a bit closer than normal, that plume could slice through the weakened energy fields and cut into the hull beneath.", "All in all, it was just a minor thing. Another cut into the flanks of a bull fighting in the arena. The animal was hurt, but it wasn\u2019t beaten. If its screens fell and it failed to restore them before IKagge reached energy range, it would be. Until then, its own missiles were lashing at the Coyote like the kine\u2019s goring horns.", "Two directed more power to its engines, pushing them into the red, but it didn\u2019t believe it would get there in time.", "~", "Vamn felt the shiver of a hull strike. Weakened by the battlecruiser\u2019s screens, the missile plume didn\u2019t breach his ship\u2019s armour too deeply, but it wiped away Augur Forty-Two. Two souls went with that position. Neither the scope system\u2019s loss nor that of the crew impeded Ecanok\u2019s Blade\u2019s combat capability, but it was another injury amongst many. And many added up.", "The Tribune adjusted his personal display. Amidst the inferno of his missile assault, the Cicatrix was even harder to make out, a squall of radiation, swathes of plasma hotter than a star, electromagnetic storms and dispersing blast scars further distorting and obfuscating his scopes, like the dazzle-painting of ocean-going warships millennia past. He still had a usable lock and Ecanok\u2019s Blade continued to fire into the maelstrom, but he didn\u2019t know what he was doing to his enemy. He knew he was hitting it. He knew they had to be hurting it, but he couldn\u2019t tell how much. Not as heavily as he had that first engagement, but as with his ship, those little cuts added up. Not fast enough.", "Any other vessel of that weight would have been shot to pieces by now, pounded into a radioactive tomb by the battlecruiser\u2019s relentless fury, but the Cicatrix was Gravestone-built. It had slithered from whatever grotesque womb had borne it and it refused to accept its rightful fate.", "For a brief instant, in their shared defiance and intransigence, Vamn felt a kind of kinship with his unseen foe. It passed quickly, chased away by everything his opposite and their degenerate people had done, all the lives that they had destroyed. His hate grew, his orders continued to pass to his crew and he watched the enemy vessel, hoping very much to see it die.", "~", "+dorsal shield status critical+", "+ventral shield 63%+", "+prow shield 22%+", "+missile bay twelve: 16 warheads remaining+", "+power disruption in section C-43. rerouting+", "+contact lost with recon drone 47. redeploying 46 and 48+", "Cerulean Eight tracked its mounting damage as the range to its target shrank. Its hits became more frequent as it could exert more direct control over its missiles and it peeled through layer after layer of hostile jamming, picking off decoy platforms and EW drones, bringing the Enemy battlecruiser into firmer targeting solutions, hitting it harder with every salvo, but for every missile that IKagge launched at it, Ecanok\u2019s Blade sent three back; if its targeting systems and electronic warfare were inferior to those of the Coyote, the larger warship\u2019s greater number of weapons allowed it to match the smaller vessel\u2019s destructiveness while its larger reserves let it spend missiles with abandon.", "Neither side had any reason to hold back. If the alien didn\u2019t disable IKagge, it would be hunted down and destroyed. If IKagge didn\u2019t press the assault, the battlecruiser might be able to break contact and this running battle would continue, with greater risk of the transit line behind expose.", "The equations had to balance. The negative variable had to be removed. Duty had to be completed.", "Cerulean Eight wouldn\u2019t allow any other outcome.", "~", "Vamn watched one of the foe\u2019s missiles lose lock on Ecanok\u2019s Blade, chasing a scope echo until it plowed into a frozen moon, sending ripples cascading through the ice-coated surface and a tall plume of ejecta spraying out of the planetoid\u2019s weak gravity. Even without their warheads, missiles were devastating kinetic weapons. They were large enough and fast enough that a direct hit put to shame all but the largest of asteroid impacts. Even when providing orbital support, unless you intended to utterly flatten a world or cared not one whit about the lives of anyone \u2013 including your own people \u2013 below, a starship had to reign its destructive capabilities in, dialing down its firepower or relying on point defences for pinpoint bombardment.", "Normally, on-board safeties prevented wayward missiles from causing accidental planetary strikes. Few civilized nations \u2013 for those that did, did not deserve that appellation \u2013 were so flagrantly uncaring as to do otherwise. This weapon must have been damaged or faulty as Gravestone, despite their many sins, followed that doctrine as well.", "They were responsible for countless millions \u2013 and perhaps more \u2013 of civilian deaths, but those were always incidental, and not the goal itself. Galhemna was the most recent example: Gravestone\u2019s targets had been the shipwombs and industrial production, crippling the Compact\u2019s forces in the region and destroying the thousands of warships slated for Operation Sundial. The millions of yard workers, engineers, technicians, administrators and servicers had just\u2026 been in the way.", "Vamn wished he could hate Gravestone for that, and he did despise them for all the lives lost as mere collateral in their prosecution of an obscene, pointless conflict, but the manner of it\u2026 there was no such thing as a clean war, where only soldiers died and it was always quick and painless. The innocent died alongside the guilty and civilians next to soldiers. Gravestone wasn\u2019t special in that regards. The Tribune already had enough reasons to see them destroyed; he didn\u2019t need to rationalize more.", "Ecanok\u2019s Blade decelerated, threading its way through moons and rings, the wake from its drive tossing asteroids and ice fragments about like debris in a storm-tossed sea. Weapons fire chased after the warship. Status indicators pulsed orange. The battlecruiser\u2019s screens were on the verge of collapse. It was a minor miracle that they hadn\u2019t done so already. Vamn\u2019s ship was bleeding from a thousand cuts, with systems damaged and disrupted across the breadth of the wounded vessel. The Cicatrix had been hurt too; the effectiveness of its jamming had dropped. He\u2019d gotten a piece of it. Not as much as he should have. He\u2019d knocked out two of its screen plates, but they\u2019d come back to full strength within seconds. This would have to be settled at close range.", "Railfire, ranging and light, slashed across the battlecruiser\u2019s path. The distance was too great for any real chance at hits, but these were probing attacks. The Cicatrix was trying to get a better feel for the evasion patterns his ship was running, just like a networked Jackal squadron might. Once it had that, it would be able to predict his movements and drop rounds directly in his path. He didn\u2019t intend to give it the chance to do so. The planet\u2019s horizon was approaching. Ecanok\u2019s Blade rose up through the Cemkol Gap within the world\u2019s rings. A mass round splashed into a ring shepherd, spraying ice and rock for thousands of kilometers and creating furrows through the once neatly-ordered rings. Vamn\u2019s eyes narrowed. Clever, aren\u2019t you?", "That hadn\u2019t been an accident. The Cicatrix was using the larger planetoids like fragmentation rounds, scattering pieces of them across his path. As he watched, it shattered a second one. Building-sized pieces of rock and ice sprayed like the belch of a flechette gun. The strike cruiser closed into the outer lunar orbits, a juresh following a bloodtrail. Its energy signature spiked with weapons fire. Screen diagnostics flashed critical.", "Then they were out of its line of fire. Ecanok\u2019s Blade banked hard as it curled around the nameless gas world, racing to put the bulk of the planet between it and the Cicatrix. Once he did, they\u2019d both be out of direct line-of-sight to each other, but his drone network was a patchwork of hagn-eaten cloth, with huge gaps in coverage while the Cicatrix was still receiving data from the drones pacing Ecanok\u2019s Blade. Precious, vital seconds passed as the strike cruiser drew closer to Ecanok\u2019s Blade\u2019s blind zones. Timing was critical. It had to see him, but far more important, it had to know what he was doing. Chase us, he urged. Kill us. Closer, damn you. We\u2019re trying to slingshot out-system. You can\u2019t let that happen. Chase us.", "\u201cStatus?\u201d He asked of his Operations and Scopes teams, listening as they reported in, displaying their findings hurriedly. He\u2019d given them a priority assignment: locate the enemy scope drones that were tracking him. That the task was difficult was an understatement. Not all of them had been found, but enough. Enough to matter, to buy him several crucial moments. If he hadn\u2019t, then this would end badly. Ecanok\u2019s Blade crossed the planet\u2019s horizon.", "He counted down more lost seconds. There; the Cicatrix had him again. It knew what he was attempting, and it had already countered, sweeping dangerously close to the planet, but its course would shave several million kilometers off the range between them. There was no escaping it now. The Cicatrix\u2019s signal vanished as his augurs finally lost contact. He wouldn\u2019t see it again until it came over the planet\u2019s horizon. Missiles still lapped the world, striking at the battlecruiser from above, below, ahead and behind. There was no telling where the ship that had launched them was. He was blind and had to guess where it was and what it was doing.", "Time to cut out your eyes, then.", "\u201cKill the drones,\u201d Vamn ordered. \u201cHelm, as soon as they\u2019re blinded \u2013 high energy turn. Bring us about.\u201d", "If he\u2019d guessed wrong, if his people hadn\u2019t found enough of those platforms, if his enemy had decided to come at him from a different angle, if its loss of scope contact made it too cautious, if it hadn\u2019t already crossed the point of no return\u2026 if any one of those possibilities had occurred, then he and his ship were about to die. It might anyways, for what he\u2019d just asked of it.", "Ecanok\u2019s Blade had no voice, but it seemed to the prime that the great vessel howled in agony as it flipped end-for-end and its damaged engines fought hard to kill its forward thrust. Warnings and hazard indicators shrieked and throbbed as the vessel\u2019s internal damage and casualties doubled and then tripled in those moments. An intact ship would have dealt with the stress of the maneuver far better, but the battlecruiser held together. That was all that mattered now. He ignored the damage reports. They were irrelevant. By his estimation, he only had seconds before the Cicatrix appeared and killed him.", "Weapons batteries were ready, turrets assigned pre-programmed fire patterns. There would be no time to give the order to fire. The window of opportunity would be measured in heartbeats, or even less. An organic leader and crew could never have reacted in time, not at the velocities and distances involved. Vamn was a passenger on his ship for this most crucial moment. He had no say in what happened next, no chance to change it from what he\u2019d already planned. The success or failure of his plan had already been set. All that was left was to catch up to that uncertain destiny.", "The Cicatrix came around the planet, hoping to find his aft section open to its guns, but fully expecting a trick. Its leader probably foresaw a minefield that it could shoot through, or Ecanok\u2019s Blade putting itself on a ballistic course so that it could turn its broadsides onto its pursuer. Instead, the battlecruiser was far closer than expected. It had done the insane and unthinkable. The flip and burn that Vamn had ordered had wreaked terrible havoc on his own ship, but it let him create a point-blank killzone that the Cicatrix had just flown into.", "The smaller warship reacted far faster than it should have, banking hard in a high energy turn of its own as it desperately clawed to open the range and pull itself out of the arc of its enemy\u2019s guns.", "None of that made any difference at all.", "With a shudder that shook the wounded battlecruiser to its very core, Ecanok\u2019s Blade fired.", "~", "Cerulean Two didn\u2019t just see its sibling die. Far worse than that, it felt Eight\u2019s death. Lakhesis\u2019s position was such that it had a clear sensor line to the Enemy warship. It saw the battlecruiser sweep behind the planet. In a flash of intuition, it knew what was going to happen. It knew what it would have done and it saw that very thing unfolding before its sensors. There was nothing it could do. Even as it blurted a priority cry to its sibling, Two knew that there was no time, no time to do anything but watch.", "Almost anything. Two took then miniscule chance it had, even as its logic engines repeated the same dreadful fact, over and over: it had been too slow. Nothing it had just done would affect the outcome. The equations lined up, but Cerulean Two couldn\u2019t accept them. They had to be wrong. There had to be something it had overlooked. It had to have predicted incorrectly. Its intuition was wrong. Something wasn\u2019t adding up, because it wasn\u2019t helplessly watching its sibling fly into a trap. It couldn\u2019t be.", "But it could, it was and it did.", "The distance between the strike cruisers was too great for real-time communication. As Eight\u2019s ship-self had swung around the planet, it had been sending its data to Lakhesis. Its final report ended mid-sentence, as close to surprise \u2013 to shock \u2013 as it could come.", "It took approximately four point seven seconds for Cerulean Two \u2013 an eternity for an AI \u2013 to process this information. What it had seen had already happened. There was no changing it. Its last gambit had failed. Over and over it watched IKagge shatter. Over and over it replayed Cerulean Eight\u2019s final message, as if desperation might somehow change it. Each time it ended in the same way, with the sudden termination of its sibling\u2019s voice.", "Two sent queries to IKagge\u2019s remaining sensor drones, but it would be some time before it received their data. It wouldn\u2019t change a thing, though. No matter how much it wanted, it needed that reality to change, it wouldn\u2019t.", "Cerulean Eight was dead. That fact burned in the core of Two\u2019s mind, and with the fire came something else.", "~", "It took less than two seconds to kill the Cicatrix, but it did not die easily or quietly. The vector the strike cruiser had taken wasn\u2019t an exact match to what Vamn had guessed \u2013 getting that right would have been next to impossible \u2013 but it was close enough that Ecanok\u2019s Blade\u2019s computer was able to quickly select the appropriate volley patterns. Ecanok\u2019s Blade fired everything it could bring to bear, hundreds of lasers and railcannons set to rapid-fire and filling a narrow corridor of space with hard light and mass rounds. The smaller vessel\u2019s screens ignited in an iridescent death flare as they struggled to hold back the torrent. High-energy and tightly focused beams punched through the Cicatrix\u2019s defences, cutting through energy fields and armour alike, ripping into the hull and penetrating one airless deck after another.", "Sensors, weapons bays and other external hardpoints were wiped away in heartbeats. The smaller vessel was finally outmatched, unable to repel the apocalyptic firepower it was taking. Its screens were overwhelmed and it had neither the time to reset them or roll away from the overwhelming assault.", "Cerulean Eight did not panic. It was surprised but unlike a crewed ship, whose painfully slow reactions might have doomed their vessel without firing a shot in their own defence, it was not hampered by emotion. Not disbelief, shock or terror. Even as it clawed for distance, knowing that it was too late, its own guns fired back. Smaller and fewer in number than those of its foe, they were nonetheless nearly as powerful. Particle beams slashed through the battlecruiser\u2019s screens as if they didn\u2019t exist, carving through its hull from the depressurized outer decks into the inner ones.

Others died kicking and screaming as they were pulled out of the fissures IKagge tore in Ecanok\u2019s Blade and into the airless void.", "Radiation warnings howled like damned souls in section after section as Bremsstrahlung, a parting gift from the particle beams, spread like poison. High-energy lasers, with beam diameters only a handful of centimeters across, slashed through armour and ripped critical systems apart. Instants later, the alien screens, already overburdened and kept upright only through monumental effort and sacrifice by the engineering teams, finally collapsed. More fire poured into the vulnerable ship. Ablative armour boiled away. Hull plates buckled, shattered, or were cored through. Crew died in their hundreds. Augurs, hull-mounted weapons, thruster banks, screen projectors and more were reduced to hemorrhaging vapour by the Cerulean Eight\u2019s final wrath.", "Ecanok\u2019s Blade shuddered from the fusillade, but the battlecruiser was the victor in this exchange. Its hull was heavily armoured, redundancies took over from destroyed hardware, damaged systems were re-routed and throughout the strike cruiser\u2019s retaliation, Ecanok\u2019s Blade kept up its barrage, ready and able to turn IKagge into a cloud of vapour. As it turned out, that wasn\u2019t necessary. Penetrating fire cut into the strike cruiser\u2019s armoured core and, wholly by accident, a laser beam smashed through the reinforced silo where IKagge\u2019s primary computer core was housed. Everything in the chamber was reduced to superheated vapour, the explosive overpressure blowing out through four decks and obliterating even more of the strike cruiser\u2019s vital hardware, but that was merely punctuation to the statement.

IKagge was an empty shell.", "Ecanok\u2019s Blade continued to tear into the smaller vessel, but as the Cicatrix sailed out of the wallowing warship\u2019s fire arcs, its own assault slowed.

It had been decelerating to stay within the planet\u2019s orbit. Even before it had come about to engage IKagge, Two had launched her last two impactors, predicting her alien counterpart\u2019s actions with fateful prescience. The distance was still long though, and even a Cerulean\u2019s calculations could not be perfect.", "The first round overshot its target by more than a million kilometers, thrusters flashing and dying as it swung about in a futile second attack run, but its goal wasn\u2019t to strike the battlecruiser.

There was just enough time between the launches to allow for the first impactor to make its report and for the second to course correct and with that update, that million kilometers dropped to less than a thousand.", "Under any other circumstances, Ecanok\u2019s Blade might have been able to react in time.

The impactor didn\u2019t achieve a direct hit, but it was close enough that that scarcely made any difference. Without shields, the antimatter detonation immolated the battlecruiser\u2019s aft section, reducing the vessel\u2019s primary sublight and FTL drives to mangled wreckage.

He gestured for Communications to play the response.", "As he heard it, the coldness returned, sharper and jabbing into his liver. Laughter. A young girl\u2019s laughter, but once again sounding like something that no child should have ever made. It was awful, insane. There was no other response but that demented sound.

IKagge could be salvaged. It would fly and fight again, but there would never be another Cerulean Eight. Everything that it \u2013 that she \u2013 could have been had been taken from her.", "Two struggled with that concept, the discordance and unfairness of it ricocheting through her mind. She was still too young, too inexperienced to fully understand what it was she was feeling, but there were words deep in her databanks. They were almost three thousand years old and for now, were all that she could put to the loss of her sibling and the destruction of all the possible futures that Cerulean Eight could have had.", "Tears in the rain.", "~", "Vamn felt the vibrations as boarding craft latched onto his ship. They targeted hangars and cargo doors for easy access or clamped on to the battlecruiser\u2019s hull and started burning their way through meters-thick armour like it was nothing but foam padding. Security teams and Janissary squads had been mobilized. Access to command had been fortified, as had Engineering and all other vital systems. Vamn would not allow Ecanok\u2019s Blade to be another prize in Gravestone\u2019s armada. He would destroy the ship long before that happened.", "The Scar was circling Ecanok\u2019s Blade, well beyond reach of even the most violent self-destruct. It had surgically defanged the battlecruiser, destroying weapons batteries and point defence site to allow its boarding to go unopposed, content to watch the proceedings from a distance. It knew Ecanok\u2019s Blade\u2019s primary reactor was still operational and it wasn\u2019t nearly foolish enough to bring itself closer. Not until it had secured its prize.", "If its initial boarding waves went badly, the warship might be drawn in to provide support. That was Vamn\u2019s hope now. To bait his killers in and take them into death with him. His mission had failed, but he took solace in knowing that the Compact still knew about the corridor. Others would come. These systems would become a bloody battleground, but the Compact would succeed. His nation had survived for six thousand years. This foe would not be the one to bring it down. He believed that, and until his last breath he would do everything in his power to make that belief reality.", "He looked at his people. They were all armed, the command deck\u2019s weapons lockers opened. Armsmen and security proctors had taken position inside the bridge, just as the Janissaries had done so outside. \u201cWe will not allow them to take this ship,\u201d he told his people. \u201cThat is our final duty. We\u2019ll bleed them for every meter of hallway, every room, every chamber that they try to claim. And if they see victory before them, we will deny it. We are soldiers of the Compact.

And let me spit in your face as you drive the blade in.", "~", "Cerulean Two had no intention of taking Ecanok\u2019s Blade. At least, not in the manner that Vamn believed she did, but she was content to let her opponents believe that. Her first waves of boarders operated exactly as they should if their objective was to take the ship, but their initial goal was accomplished within the first few moments of the assault. Ecanok\u2019s Blade had locked down its computer, but Two wasn\u2019t interested in primary systems. Her automations delved into logs, trying to find the hidden secret she suspected existed.", "The vindication sent a flash of delighted surprise through the AI\u2019s circuits. \u2018What you did to mine.\u2019 That\u2019s what you said, wasn\u2019t it? Not that she\u2019s dead. Not that we killed her. The battlecruiser\u2019s logs confirmed Two\u2019s intuition. Ecanok\u2019s Blade had taken aboard personnel from Oathcurser\u2019s Bane, but they\u2019d discovered the nanite clusters that Eight\u2019s units had implanted in the surviving crew. That was exactly what Two had hoped she\u2019d discover.", "Her units were still fighting around Engineering and attempting to make a push on the bridge. With a bit more effort, she could break through, but the alien commander would almost certainly destroy the ship before she could secure it. That was irrelevant; her goal wasn\u2019t the capture of a functional starship. The raw materials from a wreck would be good enough, but even if she couldn\u2019t prevent the aliens from destroying their ship, she only had to delay them. She had to make them believe that they had a chance to stalemate her, that they had time to enact whatever final gambit the enemy was hoping to carry out.

Not only from without; the boarders shut down the security doors in that section and the \u2018survivors\u2019 of Oathcurser\u2019s Bane surged out of their barracks. Three of them were killed in the fracas. Treshu was not among the casualties. He felt sick for being glad that she wasn\u2019t, and paradoxically for wishing that she was.", "At first he was confused by Gravestone\u2019s actions; the manpower that the infected personnel added to the assault was negligible. The quarantined decks were just living quarters and a small medical unit. There were no vital ship systems in the area, nothing that would warrant the attackers diverting the kinds of forces that they had to free sixteen souls.", "It was only when he looked through the list of computer breaches that he put it together. Medical files had been compromised, specifically those documents, records and methodologies pertaining to the detection of the nanites and potential treatments. He keyed a channel to the commander of his Janissary detachment. \u201cRedeploy immediately,\u201d he ordered. \u201cDon\u2019t let any of Oathcurser\u2019s Bane\u2019s survivors get off this ship.\u201d He paused for a single breath. \u201cNone of them.\u201d", "Renilip was looking at him in confusion. \u201cThey know how we spotted their infiltrators,\u201d he told her. \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything about the data they\u2019ve taken, but the survivors\u2026\u201d Once Gravestone adjusted their machines, they\u2019d try again. They\u2019d use those people as infiltrators, slipping them into the Space Force again as they\u2019d tried and failed with him.

That was the only reason he hadn\u2019t destroyed the ship already, but that hope wasn\u2019t worth letting those survivors go. He was giving his people one chance to stop them. If that failed, his last act would be denying his enemy their own victory. Everyone loses.", "The enemy knew his plans. Hardly a large leap of logic; they\u2019d spotted his defenders moving to intercept them and they knew the condition of his vessel. The assault forces around Main Engineering pushed harder. As he watched the battle escalate, each side fighting with mounting desperation, he opened a clear channel to the compromised sections. \u201cTell me,\u201d he asked. \u201cDid I even rescue my sister?\u201d", "There was a pause before Treshu answered. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean, Vamn,\u201d she told him. She had a gun in her hand, she was moving alongside Gravestone\u2019s boarders. That answer said everything. Whether she was no longer herself, or had been changed so utterly that she truly couldn\u2019t understand what was happening and what he meant no longer mattered. That wasn\u2019t his sister. His sister had died aboard Oathcurser\u2019s Bane.", "\u201cThen I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Even facing that truth, he still hoped some part of her could hear him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I failed.\u201d He closed the channel.

Gravestone\u2019s baorders were attempting to commandeer the battlecruiser\u2019s remaining courier. Gunfire slashed back and forth. Men and women on both sides screamed, thrashed and died. Six of the survivors went down. The rest ran. One woman was crawling towards the compromised vessel. A Janissary shot her in the back of the head, the soldier dying himself a heartbeat later.", "He saw his sister stagger, saw a bullet hole blossom in her back. She almost didn\u2019t make it onto the shuttle, but the invaders formed a shield with their bodies around the ramp, taking the hits in place of the last few infected personnel.

I figured since I'm working on it more now, I'd put it up here for everyone else to enjoy/theorize about.", "For those of you who want to remain unspoiled until the work drops in completion, I've put the snippet in spoilers and ask anyone who wants to discuss it to do the same.", "Spoiler", "Even in its final throes, the beast refused to die.", "Glory of Oada was lost, and with it, more than two hundred other warships. All to kill a single enemy vessel, but they had succeeded. Group Leader Prime Torten Omin Curz Lalen Cura Strom Dgal, sigil leader of the Compact Space Force War Vessel Glory of Oada, watched as their target died before him. Its hull was cratered and it was breaking apart as the gravity of a gas giant latched onto its wreckage and pulled it down into its inescapable embrace. Even now, he could see the beast trying to repair itself, the vessel regenerating even as he watched, but the damage inflicted upon it was too extreme. The planet had it now, and it would pull the towering monstrosity down through thousands of kilometers of clouds into its core, crushing it beyond recognition in the process.", "\u201cNo,\u201d the Tribune said with a satisfied cough. \u201cNo, there\u2019s no escape.\u201d He looked over his shoulder at the armoured doors to the Chariot\u2019s command deck. They were glowing as the creatures on the other side tried to cut their way through. \u201cNot for any of us.\u201d", "Let us in, the dead demanded, their voices rolling through the intercom. Let us in, let us save you.", "For long years, the star system of Anvil 731 had been a lonely outpost on the edge of the Compact of Species, an undermanned fortress watching over distant colonies and providing aid to the far-travelling expeditions that passed through it out into the unknown.", "Frontier regions were always dangerous; fledging and undefended colonies with supply runs of fat-hulled transports carrying valuable industrial supplies and infrastructure were tempting targets for Unbound. The grip of the Space Force was weak here, with too few ships to cover too much territory. Vermin flourished in such environments, whether criminals, Jackal ghost fleets. Ships went missing. Worlds went dark. The dead hulks of the former and the silent, depopulated remains of the latter bespoke this kind of predation.", "At first, Local Command believed what was happening in their sector to simply be the inevitable and unpleasant consequences of living in an area far from civilization. More patrols were scheduled, more ships were requested from Force Command, and the inhabitants were warned and educated about matters of safety and security, but losses continued to rise. Rumours began to spread. Anvil 731 did what it could, but there was simply too much territory for its garrisons and patrols to adequately cover.", "There were regions of space more dangerous than others, such as the Agrinna Expanse, the Mortek Star Cluster or the Kaedan Vault. It was suspected that this sector was simply another one of those, perhaps helped along by opportunists such as the Jackals or the Red Hand. That was until the deep-range explorer Eventful Horizons arrived in Anvil 731. Eventful Horizons had been reported missing for several months, one of several such vessels to have disappeared recently. It returned with a dead crew, its hull mangled and holed by weapons fire and databanks showing what it had seen far beyond the edges of known space. ", "With that, the Compact no longer considered Anvil 731 to be a minor outpost to be sent whatever could be spared. Support and reinforcements began to arrive in greater numbers. A reconnaissance in force was launched at the coordinates Eventful Horizons had carried, only to find empty space and deserted systems\u2026 at first.", "The recon force\u2019s final message arrived in Anvil 731 upon a courier drone, two words only that would have been aggravatingly cryptic but for the reams of information included within the drone\u2019s data tracks.", "IT\u2019S AWAKE."]}
