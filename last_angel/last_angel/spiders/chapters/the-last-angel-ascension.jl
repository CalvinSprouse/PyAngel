Four dozen days of of travelling from one pocket of molecular gas to the next, chasing shadows and hunting for echoes. Eight weeks of furtive scope contacts as their quarry haunted their steps, maddeningly brief encounters that lured them in directions that seemed to be without pattern or reason, but there was one, <i>oh yes</i>. Column Leader Prime Tren (and seven names besides) knew there was a reason for everything this abomination did, even if the only underlying pattern was to make them think that there was none. Some of his strategists claimed that their quarry was mad, that its actions could not be explained any other way, but the Prime knew otherwise.<br>\n<br>\nIt was was playing with them. They'd spend days chasing leaked signals, winding through the trails of clear space amidst the cloying, augur-clogging gas clouds only to come up with decrepit comm buoys and minefields. They'd follow an engine wake into one of the many pockets of dust, only to have their prey fire from the blackness and fade away before they could retaliate, or have it pounce on isolated vessels. More than once, he had sent seven-strong squadrons to flush their quarry out, only to have six come back. Save for the thermal scars and radiation spikes, there was never any sign of his lost ships. No physical sign, at least. His missing vessels and crews called to him still. The bitch-thing was playing with them, broadcasting the distress calls of dead ships and murdered crews. Morale had taken a hit when he'd ordered that all distress calls were now to be ignored. He'd lost other ships as they'd tried to find their injured comrades, rescuers vanishing into swathes of nothingnes. Then, it had been their cries for aid that had been heard next.<br>\n<br>\nTren was slouched in his command throne. It was not a true leader's posture. It did not radiate command and surety. All four of his aching eyes were red-rimmed from staring at screens and plots for hours on end. His head throbbed with a migraine he'd carried for days. What sleep he got was fitful and unsatisfying. He still had enough ships. If he could bring the beast to battle, he could end this.<br>\n<br>\n\"Patron,\" Communications reported, lifting her head. Like him, she was tired. \"Another transmission. It's the <i>Scales of Truth</i>. It's very faint, but we have a vector.\"<br>\n<br>\nThat ship had been missing for six days.<br>\n<br>\n\"Ignore it,\" the Column Leader Prime rasped, not knowing whether he was passing over a trap or condemning a crew that hoped for salvation. \"All ships will continue on course.\" He turned himself back to the main viewscreen, staring out at the starless emptiness. Not for the first time, he wondered just what was staring back.<br>\n<br>\n~<br>\n<br>\nThe prey ships stayed in formation, dozens strong. None broke away and they advanced in a solid wall, scouring this micronebula for any trace of their quarry.<br>\n<br>\n<i>Sitamun</i> watched them march on, the Naiad hissing like lightning striking sheet metal and rolling on her axis to punctuate her displeasure. &lt;they're ignoring our songs&gt;<br>\n<br>\n<i>&lt;</i>yes,&gt; a different voice said.

She\u2019d asked why Red was so focused on that system in particular. The main holo tank came to life, revealing hundreds of tactical reports, threat analyses, captured data tracks and various other bits that Red and her cat\u2019s paws had been collecting from the Veiled Reaches over the course of decades. Most of the information was months out of date, or even older.

First and foremost, her network was sorely lacking in manpower and she relied almost totally on information raids, data-harvesting and infective programs. It could take months or years for her to visit any particular data-drop site, or acquire data from any given effort. Her attack programs and the information caches they created were frequently discovered and destroyed, often without the Compact even knowing to whom they belonged.</i>", "<i>Another issue facing the AI was that her network had almost no penetration of the older, more established Compact worlds and she was blind to the plans of the Inner Council and Force Command until they put their machinations into motion. Despite all that, the warship had nonetheless amassed a staggering amount of information from what sources she did have. It was enough to choke entire intelligence divisions for months or years, but she could process it far faster than simple organics, collating and cross-referencing classified military files, political analyses, trade reports, security briefings and thousands of other bits of electronic flotsam and jetsam, weaving them into potentialities, her mind plotting out a thousand times a thousand different outcomes.</i>", "<i>She was walking Grace through one of them now.

Isolated garrisons were obliterated, construction bases and military outposts were annihilated one after the other. The fleets that first attempted to stop them were too small. By the time any larger forces could be assembled, the Sundial armada had ripped gaping holes in the Principality\u2019s defences, supply lines and logistics chains. It was a massacre. \u201cDon\u2019t they know?\u201d she asked. \u201cThey have to know.

They\u2019ve also been conducting a strategic misinformation campaign to keep the Argosy looking in the wrong directions even if they suspect a flanking assault of this magnitude. The Principality has likely learned something of Sundial, but I doubt they know what it actually is. By the time they do, Galhemna\u2019s defences will strong enough to repel any pre-emptive actions.

The dissent I have found in their archives and computers is based on degree and method, not on ultimate goals or intents.

I reject the Compact\u2019s concept of \u2018racial madness\u2019, but I have encountered species and civilizations so utterly foreign in their thoughts and behaviour that meaningful communication between them and other organic species is nearly, if not totally, impossible. This becomes all the more difficult and dangerous when these species are hostile. <br>\n<br>\nThe Anorax are the Compact\u2019s benchmark for this: a species responsible for multiple genocides and utterly incapable of conceptualizing other sapient life as anything other than a threat to be destroyed.<br>\n<br>\nThe Mejjatrythe are mine.
