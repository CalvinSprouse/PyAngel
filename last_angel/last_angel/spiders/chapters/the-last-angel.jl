They never had a chance, not really. But they had protected the killer as it advanced on the god, savaging the god\u2019s own defenders, dying in droves as the killer unsheathed its sword. Shock, surprise, anger, fear. Though the god had been alone, it was one of many \u2013 and all of them conquerors. Immortal. None of its kin had ever fallen, not ever, not to such primitives. But the killer had taken the god\u2019s fury, retaliating with a holocaust more horrible than the god or its followers had conceived of. It should not have been possible.", "It had fought, at first. The god had been arrogant and proud as it stood against the impudent mites that had dared to challenge it. Then, uncertainty had crept in as the killer shrugged aside thunder and flame that could smite planets. Next was disbelief as the killer\u2019s weapons opened its guts. Then, fear as the killer refused to die. At the last, the god tried to run. Even in retreat, it lashed out at its murderer, both of them dying, both of them burning together in shared hellfire.

She wanted someone else to see this. \u201cShow me,\u201d she breathed.

I should have detected the faults in my shift drive. I should have known what would happen when I tried a warp jump. I lied to Yasmine. I betrayed her. I did not mean to, but I did. My jump did not take us home. It nearly killed me. I wallowed, blind and broken in the void between stars for days. When I finally did return to Earth, it was too late. I remember the silence. No radio waves, no transmissions from watchposts, no challenges from the defence grid. No radio transmissions from satellites and towers. No television broadcasts.

The arrogance of them.", "I think that that was the moment in which I was given a soul, for all I remember is something that I had never been expected to feel. Hate. They screamed for help, begging and pleading for aid, but I silenced their cries. The first two I reduced to nothing but vapour with my remaining missiles. The third, fourth and fifth burned under my guns: holed, irradiated and melted into spastic, fragmenting clouds. The sixth I twisted and bent, ripping it into a parody of form and function. The last... I ran them down. I broke their spine against my prow and felt the shattered wreckage of their ship spall and slide across my hull. Not a single lifepod or courier escaped me. It was too quick. When it was over, the silence still remained.", "This was my fault. This was my sin. A nation destroyed.

Allyria te Neu was a Verrish; just over eight feet tall, she looked almost comical in the shuttle\u2019s relatively cramped cockpit. Despite her size, the Verrisha was a lithe thing that moved with a feline grace that her upbringing around humans had done little to change. Her skin was a mottled blue and her slit-pupiled eyes were a vivid yellow-green.", "\u201cIt\u2019s the new checkpoints,\u201d Grace sighed as she logged into the shuttle\u2019s system.

Each was as long as Grace\u2019s forearm, patterned like a snake\u2019s scales.

To be reduced to this....", "As he had done on the bridge, Usul made a deliberate show of withdrawing his antique watch from his jacket pocket. \u201cYou are late,\u201d he said. \u201cShuttle Nine-Nine-Three was scheduled for embarkation twenty-three minutes ago. Our departure from orbit has been delayed. Time. Time is the most important aspect of space travel, is it not?\u201d", "\u201cYes, Group Leader!\u201d both females said.", "\u201cYes. Yes, it is.

I was having difficulty with some software adjustments that delayed our departure.\u201d", "The Group Leader let a long breath out through his nostrils. Grace watched as Usul considered Allyria\u2019s lie. He was of average height for a Tribune; perhaps seven feet tall and bulky, a trait of his heavy-gravity-world heritage. His black skin was matted with patches of denticles so fine that they were almost like hair. Two pair of eyes stared up at the Verrisha. She stared back, her hands clasped behind her back.", "Allyria towered over Usul by nearly a foot, looking down on the Tribune, her lips curling slightly as they always did when she was in the presence of one of the elite. \u201cPatron?\u201d she said after a moment. Not quite challenging him.", "Finally, Usul growled. \u201cTo your stations, both of you.\u201d", "~", "As a provisional member of the Compact Space Force, Grace was expected to be available for whatever section needed her the most on any given day. She hoped to one day be assigned to a permanent career path \u2013 she knew she showed promise in navigation \u2013 but until that day came, she found herself running errands for the Tribune department heads.", "Today, she was serving under Pack Leader Nasham Kem Unoth Ludhy Inku Pram. It was not her favourite posting. True, it was rare for humans to be considered reliable enough to be serve on weapons arrays and Pack Leader Nasham was an accomplished gunnery master; he had earned five names in his service to the Compact. He had been transferred to Rally after some sort of incident during his last posting. No one had spoken of it, but Grace knew that the Pack Leader had had a name stripped from him as a result.", "She found Pack Leader Nasham in Torpedo One, on the catwalk above Bequeathed\u2019s four prow-mounted torpedo tubes. As soon as she walked in, the Tribune paused in his inspection, his snout twitching. \u201cAh,\u201d Nasham said, both sets of eyes focusing on Grace. His smaller, upper eyes glinted slightly with reflected light. \u201cMy favourite Broken. What brings you to my department today?\u201d", "Grace sketched the pack leader a salute. \u201cSectator Citizen Grace Alice Proctor reporting for duty, patron.\u201d", "Nasham\u2019s features were unreadable, but there was a slight twist to his lips. \u201cReport to Technician Kilgrave in Battery Three, Sectator.\u201d", "~", "Robert Kilgrave was a success story. One of the first humans of Rally to be a sanctioned officer in the Compact Space Force, he had served with distinction in the marines. There were even rumours that he had served on Vara, Allyria\u2019s homeworld, helping to keep the peace on that troubled planet. The Verrisha woman despised him. Grace didn\u2019t understand why. The Verrish were a Seventh Phase Encounter species; the Tribunes had discovered Vara only about a quarter-century ago. Grace had even heard the horrifying rumour that the Verrish had resisted the Tribunes \u2013 worse, that they had done so violently. Some species did fight against incorporation into the Compact, but that was only because they didn\u2019t understand all the benefits it could bring. It was fear and ignorance that caused them to act this way. After the Calamity, the Tribunes had been there for the people of Rally and just five years ago, the Tribunes had announced that humanity had, officially, reached another step on the path to full membership in the Compact.", "Grace remembered Allyria\u2019s comment during the festivities: \u201cDid they happen to mention how many more steps there are?\u201d", "Grace simply didn\u2019t understand the other woman\u2019s bitterness towards the Tribunes. Although she did agree that Sanctioned Technician Sectator Citizen Robert Gordon Kilgrave was... not perhaps as inspirational as his \u2018vid appearances made him seem to be.", "\u201cAh, there\u2019s my graceful girl,\u201d the section chief smirked at his own joke as Grace arrived, the gesture puckering his scarred features. Half of Kilgrave\u2019s face was twisted into a grimace, courtesy of several parallel scores \u2013 the claws of something very big and very strong. Grace didn\u2019t know why the chief hadn\u2019t had the wounds regenerated. They made him hideous. \u201cGlad you could join us. We\u2019re just running a full break-down and build-up of Battery Nine. An extra pair of hands is always helpful and I know you know your way around a tool.\u201d", "Grace\u2019s jaw tightened, but she said nothing. She was only a provisional officer of the fleet; Kilgrave was sanctioned, and he was her superior. Instead, she merely waited at attention. \u201cOrders, patron?\u201d", "Robert chuckled from deep in his throat. \u201cGo give Smitty a hand in calibrating the EM shunts. But first, pick up that calibrator in the corner.\u201d", "The young woman looked to where the chief had gestured. There was nothing there. \u201cWhat calibrator, patron?\u201d", "Kilgrave plucked a calibrator out of a nearby toolkit and tossed it into the corner. \u201cThat calibrator, initiate.\u201d", "Grace\u2019s eyes flashed, but she held her tongue, bending over and picking up the tool. She could feel Kilgrave watching. It made her feel dirty. She handed the calibrator to him. \u201cWill that be all, patron?\u201d", "Smirking, he tossed it back in the box. \u201cYes, initiate. That will be all. For now.\u201d", "~", "\u201cOn your feet, Brute.\u201d", "Allyria looked up. Sweat was running down her skin, soaking her bodysuit. Her tintas hung limply down her back, themselves drenched in perspiration. Her heart was hammering in her chest and her whole body ached, but she managed to stand again, towering over her opponents.", "Demagogue Rensel (and three names besides) circled around her, his hands clasped behind his back as he spoke. \u201cWell?\u201d he demanded of his audience. \u201cWho else?\u201d", "There were two dozen humans standing around her, and three Tribunes. None of them stepped forward. Allyria flashed her teeth at Rensel. He chuckled, amused by her defiance. \u201cWhat have we learned?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cWe have learned that a single Brute is more than a match for any Broken,\u201d he eyed his human subordinates distastefully, his lips curled back in disgust. \u201cAnd apparently more than a match for some Tribunes.\u201d His glare intensified when he regarded his fellows. \u201cThis is a single Verrisha female and she has systematically humiliated each and every one of you. Have we learned anything? Brutes are faster and stronger than humans. We Tribunes are stronger, but a Verrish has greater speed and longer reach. I would have called that an even match until today. But none of you have learned a thing. I am disappointed. Combat is not just about physical skill. If it were...\u201d Rensel\u2019s jaw tightened and he cut himself off. \u201cIt is not about physical prowess. Often, it\u2019s the smartest who survives and not the strongest. So far, none of you have impressed me with either of those attributes. The only survivor I see here is this blue bitch.\u201d The demagogue shook his head mournfully. When he raised it again, he was eyeing a pair of humans vindictively. \u201cYou two. Begin.\u201d As the men circled Allyria, Rensel stepped back out of the ring. \u201cLet\u2019s see if you\u2019ve learned anything.\u201d", "A flurry of movement later and the Tribune snorted in disgust, watching as the humans picked themselves up, sore and battered. \u201cPathetic. We are not leaving until at least one of you proves to me that you have learned something.\u201d", "\u201cThat won\u2019t work,\u201d a voice interjected.", "Rensel turned towards the intruder. A human female with green eyes and a dark blonde mane. Her scent was on the Brute, too. \u201cIdentify yourself,\u201d he growled.", "\u201cSectator Citizen Grace Alice Proctor,\u201d the human saluted.", "\u201cAh, a Sectator. And a fleet Sectator at that. Hmm. So, Sectator Proctor. You take it upon yourself to find fault with my teaching methods?\u201d the Tribune purred dangerously, all four eyes centered on the small, pale-skinned creature.", "\u201cYou said you wanted someone to show you that they\u2019ve learned something,\u201d Proctor replied.", "\u201cThen by all means,\u201d Rensel said, gesturing to the ring. \u201cShow me. If you succeed, the class breaks for lunch. If you don\u2019t...\u201d he smiled. \u201cMy trainees will wait for the end of their shift before they eat.\u201d He looked from the Brute to the human. \u201cBegin.\u201d", "Before Allyria could move, Grace darted from the circle, slipped between the onlookers and grabbed one of the guns off the wall. She turned and fired. Allyria dropped to one knee as the training splash rounds spattered her with paint.", "\u201cHold,\u201d Rensel said and both women froze in place. He stalked towards Proctor, his students parting out of his way. \u201cWhat,\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cDid you think you were doing?\u201d", "\u201cUnarmed combat against a Verrish is unlikely to succeed,\u201d Grace said, coming to attention. \u201cAll you were doing was wearing her down with numbers. That\u2019s not an effective strategy.\u201d", "Rensel stared at the Broken for a moment before letting out a pleased bark, clapping his hands. \u201cYou see?\u201d he said, turning to face his students. \u201cYou see this? A provisional officer has learned in seconds what I have spent futile hours attempting to have pounded into your useless heads. It is not the strongest that always wins. It is the smartest. I made no mention that this was unarmed combat and each of you made a blithe assumption that has cost us time and energy. I would think that I have failed you as an instructor, save for the fact that this human saw the flaw in your tactics in moments. Think, evaluate, understand and act. That is how battles are won.\u201d He looked back at Proctor and tipped his head in respect. \u201cThank you, Sectator Proctor. You may take your Brute and go.\u201d", "~", "The end of the day couldn\u2019t have come sooner for Grace. She had spent her entire shift buried in the guts of a mass driver, tearing it apart and then re-assembling it, all while listening to Kilgrave\u2019s unpleasant comments. Allyria for her part was just as tired. The demagogue liked to use the Verrisha officer as a way to train the more \u2018worthy\u2019 members of his cadre. She was sprawled over her bed, her blue skin marred by dark purple bruises, her tintas hanging limply over her back or dangling from her shoulders.", "\u201cHave you checked the duty roster?\u201d the Verrisha said as Grace exited the shower. A private shower was one of the few amenities that came with bunking with the alien woman; traditional quarters for sectators of their rank and status were too small to accommodate someone of Allyria\u2019s size, so she was assigned a cabin normally reserved for trainee Tribune officers, which included a small kitchenette and washroom \u2013 luxuries that the other provisional sectators had to share between themselves.", "Grace shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re with Nasham again,\u201d Allyria commented. She sat up, pulling her shirt off.", "Grace averted her eyes from the other girl\u2019s chest, blushing furiously. Verrisha were very similar to humans... she had even heard a rumour that there was some genetic cross-contamination in the development of their species, although Grace had no idea how that could be possible. \u201cThat\u2019s just great,\u201d she sighed as Allyria slid out of her pants, blushing even more and very studiously examining the floor. Nasham\u2019s department meant at least one more day with Kilgrave.", "\u201cI\u2019ve been assigned to the Pack Leader too,\u201d the Verrisha said as she stepped towards the shower. She flashed a mouth full of very white, very sharp teeth at Grace. Her smiles still weren\u2019t quite right. \u201cAnd that waste of a sperm, sanctioned or not, knows what will happen if he messes with you when I\u2019m around.\u201d", "\u201cPlease don\u2019t start anything,\u201d Grace pleaded with her roommate as Allyria entered the shower.", "\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d the taller woman promised. \u201cBut I will finish it.\u201d", "Grace sighed. That was as good a promise as she was likely to get.", "~", "Usul held out his hand, his human steward hurrying to fill his wine glass, backing away once the Tribune signalled enough had been poured. The Group Leader took a sip; a good vintage. Despite its many failings, Rally did produce some truly excellent wines.", "His other senior officers all raised their own glasses, only drinking after their leader had done so. \u201cSo,\u201d Usul said. \u201cAnother training cruise for Rally\u2019s Broken has begun. Do I dare wonder if any of them show promise?\u201d", "His department heads weren\u2019t quick to point out any candidates, but that was hardly surprising. Humans were little more than apes that had been taught how to dress themselves. They had no technical skill, no understanding of the refinements of proper civilization and only the barest imitation of true intelligence. But the Triarchs insisted that they and all other beast-species be humoured. It was degrading. Insulting. They would never be equal, so why bother with this farce?", "Because hope breeds less dissent then despair, Usul could almost hear his father reprimanding him.", "\u201cDemagogue Rensel,\u201d Pack Leader Teroshe Vendal spoke up, and heads turned towards her. Though her rank put her on the edge of proprietary for inclusion in this gathering, she was quite a decorative addition to it. \u201cDidn\u2019t I hear that one of your human trainees actually impressed you today?\u201d", "The demagogue chuckled. \u201cIf only. No, it was a fleet officer who happened by. Sectator...\u201d he frowned, his lowermost eyes half-closing in thought. \u201cProctor. Yes, that was it.\u201d", "Usul nearly choked on his wine. \u201cProctor?\u201d he said in amazement. \u201cWell, I suppose anything is possible...\u201d he smiled. \u201cShe was probably looking for her Brute friend. Whatever she did to impress you so doubtless came from that one. Violence is their stock in trade. Well, I suppose even beasts that spend enough time sniffing around each other are bound to pick up things here and there. I wouldn\u2019t count on Proctor to repeat this performance.\u201d", "Rensel clicked his teeth together, a very assertive expression. One might even consider it aggressive, a prelude to a challenge in ancient days. \u201cPerhaps, patron. But I consider it wise never to underestimate humans.

The officers who underestimated the heretics did not survive long.\u201d", "\u201cOn the ground, I\u2019m sure a human with a rock can do a great many things and seem formidable indeed,\u201d Usul said dismissively. \u201cBut, space is the province of the civilized being, demagogue. It requires a keen mind, well-honed instincts and superior intelligence. That is why the Compact rules the stars and not the humans.\u201d He sighed, holding out his glass for more wine. \u201cWell, we shall take Bequeathed out, shock to a nearby system and allow our valued provisional officers and enlisted to gain some experience. Who knows?\u201d the Tribune said. \u201cPerhaps we will be impressed after all.\u201d", "Interlude: Encounter 004 [Confirmed Incident]", "Extermination Flotilla Anselm was dying.", "Nine vessels had been rendered inoperable already, another four had taken grievous damage.", "Column Leader Anselm (and nine names besides) felt bile bubble up into his throat as his formation died around him. They had found a human survivor fleet. They had tracked it for three weeks, despite all the humans had done to shake pursuit. Human technology was pitiable; they had never really posed a danger to the Tribune, despite the occasional minor victory that they had achieved. Completing the annihilation of the species\u2019 recalcitrant elements had been a necessary, but tedious task. Anselm\u2019s formation had already destroyed three other such forces. Mostly liners, freighters and other cattle-ships packed with mewling, frightened animals. A handful of what the humans laughingly considered combat vessels. Nothing even remotely threatening.", "Unspoken Word folded in on itself like a toy crushed in a child\u2019s fist and Anselm\u2019s losses increased to ten dead ships. It was here. The thing that should not be. The humans\u2019 only true warship. It had killed Expansion Fleet Bankala. It had killed a Triarch\u2019s Chariot. Not once in a thousand years had this thing happened and it was this tiny, mewling, pathetic little pack of barbarians that had done it. In giving it a mind, they piled heresy atop heresy in the making of this thing and now it was here.", "There had been no warning. Anselm\u2019s forces had been methodically picking off the human ships when suddenly it had shocked in, right on top of the Tribune forces. It was badly scarred, Anselm could see that, but it was like a wounded tarrhesq, driven mad with pain and all the more dangerous.", "The extermination fleet was spreading out, trying to find a way to engage the fleeing humans, but there was no way past the ravening beast before them. Missiles tore through his formation, pounding his ships into broken carcasses and if he dared close to get inside the range of those horrible warheads, it responded with batteries that smote his vessels to ruin.", "But it was wounded...", "\u201cDirective to all remaining ships,\u201d Anselm said softly as he realized the course that this battle must take. \u201cAbandon attempts to engage the human splinter. The formation will assemble into a Alduq spearhead.

Bequeathed was taking a winding, unnecessarily long course towards the system\u2019s safe shock limits \u2013 the better for the trainees to practice on various systems. Not that that would do them much good. This whole endeavour was, in Usul\u2019s opinion, a waste of his time. Not that Command had asked for his opinion on the matter before shipping him off to this misbegotten rock. He couldn\u2019t imagine who he had offended, but he must have stepped on someone\u2019s toes to end up here, a Group Leader of an antiquated cruiser, lord of a handful of proper officers and a ship-load of marginally competent humans, forced to abase himself before Rally\u2019s Academy head (may madness and disease visit her often).", "Rather than sit out on the bridge, Usul was viewing the last two days\u2019 worth of performance reports from his section chiefs. As he\u2019d expected, there was little to comment on. Hmm. One of the sectators had performed quite well in Pack Leader Nasham\u2019s fire drills. Time and accuracy was excellent for a \u2013 oh. It was the Brute. Of course it was. Out of idle curiousity, Usul skimmed down to Sectator Proctor\u2019s scores. Her time was abysmal, as he\u2019d imagined it would be. She\u2019d ordered her gun crew to hold fire until the last possible second in the drill and her accuracy... each set of Usul\u2019s eyes blinked in surprise. Her accuracy was the highest to date. In fact, it was the highest he\u2019d ever seen for an officer-in-training. How...?", "He brought up the scenario. It was a simple enough one; the humans weren\u2019t yet trusted for (or deemed capable of properly conducting) actual live-fire drills. A simulated attack by a small, heavily shrouded and highly maneuverable vessel. The goal was cripple or destroy the target before a certain percentage of damage was inflicted on Bequeathed. Time until target\u2019s destruction and accuracy of fire were judged. Proctor had done almost nothing until the damage threshold had been reached, then used a single short burst to kill the \u2018attacker\u2019 before it began its final attack run. She\u2019d noted a pattern to its behaviour and anticipated. Obviously, she had gone last and studied the battle drills of the \u2013 no, she had been second and the attack pattern was switched between each trainee\u2019s simulation.", "By contrast, Sectator te Neu had gone fourth and noticed how the attacker responded to counter-fire, using one attack to force it into a vector of her choosing, finishing it off.", "Usul leaned back in his chair, his upper eyes open while his lower pair closed in thought. It was inevitable that some animals be more intelligent than their kin. He\u2019d just never imagined to find one of those among the humans.

Grace\u2019s mother had been a kinesiologist and she\u2019d learned a few things from her. In fact, that was how they\u2019d met; after the Verrisha child had been injured in one of the many altercations she\u2019d had during her childhood, it had been Grace\u2019s mother who\u2019d assisted with the physical therapy. Allyria had had a propensity for picking fights with Tribune children. That time, she\u2019d started a dust-up with several older Tribunes and been badly beaten. Despite her injuries, the Verrisha had given back almost as good as she\u2019d gotten and there were calls to have her censured or even committed for \u2018irreconcilable antisocial behaviours\u2019.", "It had been Grace\u2019s mother who\u2019d helped the young Verrish when her host parents hadn\u2019t been able to and no one else had seemed interested in doing so. Allyria was one of several hundred Envoy Children to call Rally home. In order to cultivate the proper attitudes amongst the Verrisha population, the Tribunes had removed millions of young Verrish children from their homeworld to be raised amongst proper families from fully pacified, Incorporated Worlds in the Compact.", "As the sole human world, it was a great honour for Rally to host so many Verrish Envoy Children. Indeed, the Compact Oversight Council said it that they wanted the Verrish to learn from the humans\u2019 example of proper behaviour. Allyria had been one of the oldest Envoy Children to be transplanted to Rally. It was only natural that she\u2019d have the hardest time adjusting. It seemed that she wouldn\u2019t at all until Grace\u2019s mother took the angry young girl under her wing. Although frightened by the alien and her occasional furious outbursts, Grace had overcome her trepidation. She remembered one moment after such a rage when she\u2019d seen her mother holding Allyria; the alien girl had been as tall as Anna Proctor, but she\u2019d been slumped into the woman\u2019s arms, clutching her tightly and crying. \u201cI don\u2019t want to forget,\u201d she\u2019d said over and over. \u201cThey can\u2019t make me.\u201d", "Anna had held onto Allyria, whispering soft assurances to the distraught girl. She\u2019d seen Grace watching them, gesturing for her daughter to come over. Grace remembered how Allyria had flinched at her touch, then relaxed. Since that day and despite the differences between them, the two had become fast friends.", "However even today, Allyria was prone to tension headaches and what cultural liaison analysts called \u2018outbursts of anti-cooperative behaviour and noncompliant dialogue\u2019. Grace had long since despaired of assisting with the latter, but the former was something that she could easily help with.", "Gently moving Allyria\u2019s tintas out of the way, Grace moved her hands along Allyria\u2019s neck, starting at the base. Verrish pressure points were different than those of a human. Years back, when they\u2019d both been adolescents, she\u2019d once asked Grace about her tintas, what would happen if she touched them too. The Verrisha had blushed, looked away and mumbled something about them being \u2018very sensitive\u2019. It was only later that Grace really appreciated what that meant. Her hands moved further up Allyria\u2019s neck, finally sliding through the mass of tintas. They weren\u2019t slimy or scaly, but smooth to the touch.", "Allyria shivered slightly beneath her and Grace blushed a little, but she found what she was looking for. This was always the part that she worried about most. Verrish had two paired tintas, slightly larger than the rest. For lack of any official nomenclature, Grace\u2019s mother had simply called them the L1 and R1 tintas. They had chemo- and thermosensory cells, allowing the Verrish to interpret a great deal of information about their environment. Additionally, when someone who knew what they were doing touched them in a specific manner, it was a great help in the relief of headaches. However, they were surrounded by other head-tails and too much contact with those (or the wrong kind) could be painful or... overstimulating.", "Grace could feel the tension drain out of her friend, Allyria let out a soft, relieved coo as Grace moved her fingers over her L1 and R1 head-tails, gently squeezing the pressure points there. \u201cBetter now?\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Allyria replied. \u201cThank you.\u201d", "Grace managed to clamber off the tall woman without stepping on her, handing her a blouse as Allyria sat up. \u201cI\u2019ll write another letter to medical. You should too. They need to be getting Verrish-specific painkillers in stock.\u201d", "The blue girl made a dismissive huff as she pulled her shirt on. \u201cThey don\u2019t care. Besides,\u201d she made a little moue of disappointment, but there was a teasing glint in her eyes. \u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t want to help me?\u201d", "Grace rolled her eyes theatrically. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying.\u201d She\u2019d been Allyria\u2019s masseuse for so long, she knew more about Verrish anatomy than human. \u201cAt least until you pay your tab.\u201d", "\u201cLet me get you your first payment,\u201d Allyria chirred, reaching for a pillow.", "Grace didn\u2019t rise to the bait, instead slumping on the bed. Normally, she\u2019d be willing to play along with Allyria\u2019s immaturity. In point of fact, she\u2019d instigated more than one bout. During the first year she and Allyria had been in the academy, she\u2019d been so serious, so desperate to be nothing but the most professional, the most scholarly, the best initiate there and all she\u2019d succeeded in doing was stressing herself more and more. Allyria had broken through that self-imposed dourness with (among other things) a simple observation: you can\u2019t look dignified when you\u2019re having fun. Now, though...", "The Verrisha cocked her head. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about tomorrow.\u201d", "Grace nodded. This would be her first real shock; everything until now had been simulated on the academy\u2019s computers. She\u2019d done well on those exercises, but this was the real thing. She wasn\u2019t worried about shocking Bequeathed into a planet, but she wanted to be good. Better than good, considering the Group Leader\u2019s opinion of her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to screw this up.\u201d", "Allyria ran a hand over Grace\u2019s brow, trailing it through her hair. \u201cYou\u2019ll do well.\u201d Anna had explained to her daughter, years back, that Verrisha were a very tactile species. Although she had learned that casual physical contact could make others uneasy and restrained herself in the presence of strangers and casual acquaintances, Allyria was more relaxed around Grace. For her part, the human was long used to it; in fact, she found it comforting. \u201cBesides,\u201d the alien said. \u201cI\u2019ve been assigned to Tactical. I\u2019ve heard that the captain likes to run surprise ambush simulations after a trainee\u2019s first shock. You just have to not plow us into a star. I have to avoid getting us blown up.\u201d", "\u201cThey keep putting you with the Janissaries or on weapons,\u201d Grace observed, frowning. \u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201d", "\u201cThe Tribunes do say that we Brutes have a talent for violence,\u201d Allyria replied. She looked away, the touch of a feral smile on her face, but she bit her lip and sighed, erasing the expression.", "\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s not right.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m just pleased that they think I\u2019m tame enough to be assigned there,\u201d Allyria replied, continuing to stroke her hand along Grace\u2019s forehead and through her hair. \u201cHow many hoops would you have jump through before they\u2019d let you handle the guns?\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing that,\u201d Grace protested, but it was a weak retort. All officers, even provisional ones, went through the same basic all-fields training regimen before being assigned a career path. It was how command decided where you would best serve.", "\u201cAnd aside from \u2018extreme bravery under fire\u2019 Kilgrave, how many human officers do you know who are assigned to weapons duties?\u201d", "Grace\u2019s frown deepened. She hadn\u2019t thought about that. \u201cHumans have aptitudes for engineering and technical career paths,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the mental wherewithal for weaponry or combat skills.\u201d", "Allyria hissed, her tintas twitching angrily.", "\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Grace insisted. \u201cWhy are so few humans selected for the Janissaries or as Tactical officers if we had the aptitude for combat? The Compact has been good for us. They\u2019ve provided everything we\u2019ve ever needed. They\u2019ve taken care of us after the Cataclysm. We might have gone extinct if it wasn\u2019t for them.\u201d", "The Verrisha reached up to the pendant around her neck. She always wore it; it was the one thing she had of her homeworld and though it hadn\u2019t been deemed appropriate for proper integration into Compact society, she had been allowed to keep it. An open eye stared out at the world, a single crimson tear hanging from the azure orb. Grace had wondered at that, but assumed that it was probably symbolic. Verrish didn\u2019t have blue eyes. In the middle of the iris, someone with impressive skill had carved a symbol there, also in red. Grace didn\u2019t recognize it and Allyria had never said what it was, even when asked. She again seemed on the verge of saying something more, but merely shrugged and let the matter drop. \u201cOf course.\u201d", "She stood and left their quarters without another word. Grace watched the door close after her; it didn\u2019t feel like she\u2019d won the argument.

However, few of her shipmates invoked the same level of ire as Confessor Yurim (and two names besides). He was what might be considered a cross between a chaplain and a political officer, with all the inherent problems that that blending of roles brought with it \u2013 none of which he saw. Worse, he considered Allyria something of a pet project. Someone who just needed the right guidance to be a good, happy little member of the Compact. He\u2019d been assigned to this training cruise to help the officer cadets adjust to shipboard routines and spot any beahvioural issues before they arose.", "That didn\u2019t only make her claws unsheathe; it made her teeth ache with the need to sink them into something warm, wet (and preferably) gurgling and twitching. Right now she was considering the Confessor\u2019s throat as he walked beside her, easily matching her longer strides. He never seemed to tire and his endless reservoirs of patience only made him more annoying. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see that your compliance and assimilation acumen scores have improved,\u201d Yurim was saying. \u201cIt appears that you\u2019ve been taking our discussions to heart.\u201d", "Well, she\u2019d gotten better at lying. That, and aping the language of servitude. She knew she should be better at it, better at smiling and nodding, at mouthing the empty words that it seemed every human on Rally accepted as gospel. But she couldn\u2019t. She should; her career and future depended on it. But she couldn\u2019t. Not when she saw her fellow \u2018Envoy Children\u2019 smiling and gushing at her, mouthing the same hollow platitudes and telling her how \u2018inspirational\u2019 she was and how they hoped to serve the Compact and the Tribunes as well as she was.", "Sometimes she wished she was one of them. Too young to remember home except as an abstract, too young to remember her parents or grandparents and everything they\u2019d told her. That would be easier. \u201cI have been thinking about what you\u2019ve told me,\u201d she said at last. That was true enough.", "The Tribune\u2019s ugly features twisted in what Allyria had come to recognize as a pleased smile. Humans were strange things, so small and pale, with features strangely like those of the Verrish. They were almost like the fey imps of stories. Tribunes, though... she was used to their utterly alien appearance, but that made them no more palatable.", "\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Yurim was saying. \u201cI\u2019ve always known that you have the potential for greatness in you, initiate. I believe that once you fully come to recognize your place in the Compact, you will be a shining beacon for all other Verrish to aspire to. An inspiration for your species and success story that will help them, like the humans, eventually ascend to membership with all other truly civilized species.\u201d", "Even with her claws dulled, she could kill him before he had time to scream.

Automatons that bore only a passing resemblance to the human-sculpted drones that had once been used in defence of this vessel. They had faces, flickering holographic visages that shifted through the gamut of emotions, leering grotesquely or twisted in maddened rage. Heavily armoured brutes thudded through the halls, their arms terminating in anti-tank weaponry from which even the finest Janissary armour offered no protection, the tromp of their feet only slightly overshadowing the scrape of dangling chains and the growls of idling engines. Giggling assassin-things crawled along ceilings and walls, their deadly claws capable of cutting through the thickest armour, other murderers shimmering into existence only long enough to fire a single exquisitely-aimed shot, singling out medics, officers, engineers or heavy weapons soldiers.", "The comm systems spat static interspersed with child-like whispers and softly sung blasphemies. He had battled across a dozen worlds, against a dozen species, each with their own sad reasons to resist the Compact, but never before had the demagogue felt so... so unwanted. So hated. It was an insane thought. He had faced jeering crowds of primitives hurling rocks, fruit and filth at him and his fellow Janissaries. He had strode through a burned-out city where epithets against the Compact were scribbled on the remaining walls, survivors staring at him with blind, hating eyes... and this, this empty, soulless shell was where he felt the least welcome.", "The gestalt\u2019s madness and rage dripped from the walls.

He did not know, but he was positive that, no matter what Command claimed, the Wound was more than a mere gestalt.", "Rewn heard a soft giggle from above and looked up. Braced on the ceiling was one of the murder-things, its blank faceplate overlaid with a child\u2019s face. A flick of light and the child\u2019s face twisted into something grotesque, a warped and silently screaming visage. \u201cI hate you,\u201d the Janissary heard it whisper right before it dropped towards him, its claws shearing through his armour, ripping through his body and tossing him aside like he weighed nothing at all.", "As he felt the life drain from his flesh and saw his killer dance spastically as it was riddled by weapons fire, Rewn took very little satisfaction in his vindication.", "Although trace wreckage from several of the ships would be discovered years later, the exact cause of the flotilla\u2019s disappearance was never resolved.

In her custom-built armour, the Verrisha looked less like one of the soldiers and more like an armature or military automaton. Indeed, the weapon she had been issued would, in human hands, be a crew-served cyclic cannon, but she carried it easily.", "Pack Leader Nasham was taking a detail of technicians aboard; although he was not an engineering officer, his expertise in weaponry would be invaluable in the analysis of whatever defensive systems that the unknown possessed.

The group leader believed that the ship was dead, that this would be nothing but a salvage mission. Grace knew better than to contradict her superior, but there was something... something she couldn\u2019t put her finger on.

By contrast, Allyria found the seats far too wide for her lanky frame, but they were a much better fit for her than the human officers and enlisted.", "She checked the magazine feed on her weapon. Like everything else on Bequeathed, the weapon was out of date, but it was a reliable model and one that still saw service throughout the Compact. Looking at it, she wondered how many humans \u2013 how many Verrish \u2013 the weapon had killed. Allyria shifted in her seat. Her head-tails were unpleasantly squashed into her helmet. Though it had been custom-built for her, it was still not a comfortable fit. She had barely been consulted during the armour\u2019s construction. One would have thought that input from the species that it was designed for would have been helpful, but Tribune engineers obviously needed no second-guessing from a Brute.

Her lips curled back from her teeth, but she shoved the reflexive anger aside, standing up moving to the cockpit. The pilots were Tribunes and barely acknowledged her. She asked a few questions and received a few terse responses, but she hadn\u2019t come up to check on their status. She wanted to see it.", "They were almost close enough for visual range now; the unknown was a tiny black dot against the inferno of Terrahope. An A7, it was on the cusp of remaining a main sequence star, but not quite bright enough to be a blue giant and its light filled the shuttle\u2019s cockpit, even with the filter screens engaged. As the range dropped, Allyria looked at the solar sails that the \u2018unknown\u2019 had unfurled. She had never seen their like before, giving the alien vessel the appearance of an ancient galleon at sea as it drank in Terrahope\u2019s photons. There was still no response as the shuttles dipped their stubby wings, making a slow, close pass around the hulk, searching for an egress point.", "\u201cThere,\u201d one of the pilots said, pointing to an open hangar, the doors frozen two-thirds of the way open. \u201cThat\u2019s our landing point.\u201d The co-pilot relayed the find to the other shuttles, the entire formation slowing for their final approach. Allyria went back to her seat, giving her squad another quick readiness check. They were all young; only a few were even as old as she was... and she, like Grace, was still in her final year of study.", "She looked at them and she was reminded of the other Envoy Children. Allyria leaned back in her seat, trying to stifle her anticipation, but without much success.

The heathen vessel was a strange design, but he had seen stranger. Whoever had built it had no eye for proper aesthetic appeal, though. They were also neglectful to allow such a ship to escape their attentions, but their loss was Usul\u2019s gain. By the time anyone came to look for this damaged vessel, it and its secrets would belong to the Compact of Species... and all by Group Leader Usul\u2019s hand.", "~", "Searchlights played over the sterile, vacuum-touched deck. The bay was empty; whatever had been in here and long since been thrown into the void through the open doors. It was a massive hangar; almost twice as large as Bequeathed\u2019s main launch bay and this was only one of several such decks on the unknown. The Janissaries debarked first, their own helmet lights playing over the walls, recorders feeding data back to the shuttles. This hangar faced away from Terrahope and the only light came from the Compact\u2019s own sources of illumination.", "Allyria found her heart pounding in her chest and she stepped onto the deck, ordering her team into forward positions. Gravity was still operational, which was a small mercy. Grace\u2019s technical analysis unit followed next, trainee officers and ratings milling around, uncertain as to what they should be doing. The Verrisha let out a hiss. Usul had shoved his human crew out first to see if they drew fire. Once the ship was safe, the more valued members of Bequeathed would deign to board and the contributions of the provisional officers (and the risks they had taken) would be conveniently forgotten.", "The Verrisha knelt, running her fingers over the floor. In better times, the deck had been a polished, gleaming black but ages of neglect had seen it become scuffed and worn. She smiled, wondering if the others would see what she saw here. Was it here? she wondered. Was this where you bid them welcome?", "A murmur of conversation caught the young woman\u2019s attention and she focused on that. One of her teams had found something.", "~", "Grace frowned, looking at the faded words on the walls. It was in a language she didn\u2019t recognize, but that was hardly surprising. This was an alien vessel, after all. She played her own torch over the vast bay, trying to think of what kind of craft had been stored here. Had this been a peaceful explorer, carrying scientific probes and teams of scientists to new worlds? She\u2019d overheard the pilots talking; they said it was a warship. The thought was disturbing; who needed a vessel of this make? The Compact\u2019s own Chariots were there for the safety and security of the fleets and citizenry against any possible foe. They were the pinnacle of technology, the finest warships ever built and none had ever been lost in battle. The thought that there was another power that could match what the Compact had accomplished... it was mind-boggling.", "The man in front of her stopped so suddenly that Grace nearly walked into him. Wondering what had drawn him up short, Grace stepped around the man and her jaw dropped. Several Janissaries were there, Allyria among them. Their lights were shining on the wall, highlighting two bits of text. One was in the alien language, neatly stenciled. The other had been slopped on with whatever paint had been at hand, frozen streaks running down the bulkhead and it had been written in Common:", "GET OUT. LEAVE NOW", "SHE IS WATCHING", "~", "I should kill them all.", "That is what I should do. Yasmine would disapprove if I didn\u2019t. Of course, she would also disapprove if I did, so that leaves in me in a quandary as far as her opinion goes.", "I\u2019ve killed humans before. When I was built, I was given very strict protocols of engagement. Tribune ships may be engaged at any time and their installations and personnel are not protected by any laws of warfare. There was much debate about this; some accused Confederate Command of xenophobia and the commission of war crimes. These policies were not about treating non-humans as things, although some of my designers doubtless thought that way. Tribune soldiers cannot be trusted. Ships in distress would lure human vessels in for boarding before self-destructing, ramming or counter-boarding. Surrendered Tribune soldiers would kill medics. The enemy frequently carried out chemical attacks on civilian Confederate colonies specifically to draw out military units. Accordingly, the parameters that allowed me to attack a Tribune vessel were very... relaxed.", "Engaging humans... that was different. Before the war, there were a number of pirate clans and freebooters. During the conflict, there were still such parasites, those who took advantage of the chaos to glut themselves on whatever they could steal. Although Yasmine once referred to my use against these raiders as \u2018swatting flies with artillery\u2019, it was quite possible that I would one day be deployed against them. However, there were safeguards put in place. I\u2019m not sure why. I cannot imagine ever attacking another Fleet unit, but there was a lot of concern about the use of an artificial intelligence in command of humanity\u2019s greatest vessel, despite the necessary of it. Thus, before I engage a human target I must have a clear order to do so from the senior ranking officer. Except in cases of \u201cextreme exigency\u201d. The vagueness of that descriptor was what allowed me to break that aspect of my programming.", "I remember Gilded Antler. It was a Covenant of Truth-class battlecruiser. I hit it amidships with a particle beam, piercing its shields and burning through its armour. I placed the shot well; the command deck was completely incinerated and all senior bridge personnel were killed instantly. A human officer, Pack Leader Sharon Silverstein, took command of the secondary bridge. She was very brave and very skilled. She assessed the situation and reacted with commendable speed and thought. I think Yasmine would have liked her.", "Her command lasted thirty-nine point seven three seconds. After that, Gilded Antler was no longer recognizable as a discrete entity. Sharon Silverstein was the first human I knowingly and deliberately killed. On occasion, I have terminated human life even when there was no direct threat to myself. These operations have been primarily pre-emptive strikes or necessary silencing of witnesses, both of which are in direct contradiction to my programming.", "The imperatives that were supposed to bind my behaviour have had very little effect on me for a very long time.", "I do not think my designers would be pleased, but I hope that they would be proud.", "There is nothing stopping me from killing every one of the personnel that has boarded me, although I am hesitant to do so. I find killing humans... distasteful, but far too often it has been necessary. If I can avoid it, I will... although I fear it may not be possible. The Tribunes are all marked for death. I find their presence repugnant and I will not suffer them to live.", "My interest remains, however. The bay is depressurized, so my biosensors are useless but I do have active cameras and passive sensors. I monitor patterns of movement, examine physiologies and listen in to their communications. The information that these modes of analysis give me is just as useful as my other sensors. The Compact of Species is comprised of several subject races; even I do not know just how many. I encounter them only rarely. I am seldom boarded and what little contact I make with Compact vessels, it is always one of the \u2018master races\u2019 that is in command. I do make an effort to sift through debris, but organic beings are very fragile and war in space is not kind to them.", "Regardless, I do not need to trouble myself much. I have confirmed my earlier suspicions and my curiousity is further piqued.", "I will stay silent for now. I will watch and listen, letting them think that I am dead and that I am ripe for the taking. I will let my systems recover and, when I am ready, I will cull them... and we will see what we see.", "~", "\u201cWhat...\u201d Ideologue, Submissive Trion cleared her throat. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d she stared up at the warning, feeling a chill run down her spine. \u201cHow can this be here?\u201d", "\u201cUnknown, patron,\u201d the Brute answered her. \u201cBut it has been here for a long time.

Keep your Broken together, sectator. Your team will be taking point.\u201d", "The Brute nodded in acknowledgment. Trion tried not to think about the loathsome squirming tentacles inside its helmet. Humans were bad enough with their dull grazer\u2019s gaze, as if they were perpetually on the cusp of understanding, but there was something else that Trion had seen in this creature\u2019s eyes and she did not care for it. As if she sensed her superior\u2019s misgivings, the creature dipped its head in a submissive gesture. \u201cOf course, ideologue. Your will be done.\u201d", "Trion turned her back on the sectator and stalked towards her own superior.

Given the state of disrepair the alien vessel was in, it was no wonder why they were currently sealed. Survey teams were scouting the upper levels of the hangar, crawling along the mezzanines and catwalks, but the doors on these levels were closed just as tight. There were manual overrides, but none of them were operational. In fact, it appeared to Grace that this was less the result of age and whatever other damages the ship had suffered than a deliberate attempt to seal the doors. Whether that was to keep something out or in, she couldn\u2019t say.

If the rest of the ship was not pressurized, the doors could be closed again by cutting their power. The same could not be said for a door burnt through or blown off its hinges. Moreover, if there were indeed any crew left aboard the ship, it was hard to claim peaceful intentions when you were blasting holes in their ship.", "The ideologue had pointed out that there were already so many, who would notice one more?

The inside was stained with blood and a clear, viscous fluid. Hmm. One of his eyeballs had popped. Allyria turned the fractured visor over in her hands, disdainful of the fluids seeping on her gauntlets. She looked up. There, nestled in each corner of the airlock was a small camera bulb. \u201cYes,\u201d she answered Jameson softly, feeling a flutter in her chest. \u201cIt could have. But I\u2019m not sure it would have.\u201d", "\u201cSay that again,\u201d Advocate Illr said.", "\u201cNothing,\u201d Allyria lied, standing back up to her full height. \u201cJust a thought. My people have a saying: the gods favour the bold. One pronunciation of bold can also mean \u2018first\u2019.\u201d", "\u201cCharming,\u201d the Tribune growled. \u201cYou think your gods approved of this death?\u201d", "Allyria shrugged, dropping the smashed visor. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t presume to speak for a god, advocate.\u201d Turning her back on Illr, Allyria tried to raise her superior. \u201cSubmissive Trion, do you have orders?\u201d", "The ideologue was not responding.", "~", "The barrel of a shotgun tapped against the back of Jack Harker\u2019s helmet. The young man was still staring at the doors, still frozen in place. \u201cDisciple,\u201d Trion asked quietly, her tone very dangerous. The other humans were edging away from the Tribune. \u201cWhat happened to Convert Uday?\u201d", "\u201cHe... he...\u201d Harker couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away from the spreading pool of blood. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Trion said. Her voice was almost gentle, but there was an undercurrent of something very ugly beneath it. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d", "\u201cIdeologue...\u201d Trenis interrupted.", "\u201cBe silent,\u201d the Janissary said to the Faithful. \u201cI am having words with your disciple.\u201d", "Grace\u2019s eyes flicked to the pack leader, but Nasham seemed shaken, staring at the doors just as Harker was. One of Nasham\u2019s hands moved up to his throat.", "\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d Trion repeated. \u201cHow did that happen?\u201d", "\u201cThe... the doors.\u201d", "\u201cYes, the doors slammed shut. They were supposed to be open, disciple. The generator was hooked up. You were monitoring the power flow. Now, a Tribune is dead. One of my soldiers is dead. So tell me, what happened?\u201d There was a soft click as the shotgun cocked.", "On the other side of the door, Allyria listened to the exchange and looked over at the rest of advocate Illr\u2019s squad. None of them were saying anything. There was only silence over the comm. None of the other Tribunes would step in.", "\u201cThere was... there was an interruption in power flow,\u201d Jack said, unable to move. He didn\u2019t even seem to realize there was a gun pressed to the back of his helmet. \u201cI tried... I tried to warn everyone but...\u201d", "\u201cBut you failed,\u201d Trion purred softly. \u201cYou failed and your incompetence cost a Tribune his life. His death is your fault. Do you know what that makes you?\u201d", "\u201cNo, I...\u201d", "Trion leaned in close. \u201cA murderer,\u201d she hissed. \u201cYou killed a Tribune, disciple. Do you know what the punishment for that is?\u201d Her finger tightened on the trigger. There was a noise over the comm, something like a wet growl. Trion ignored it.", "\u201cEnough!\u201d Nasham barked as he rounded on the Janissary officer, finally coming out of his stupor. \u201cThat is enough, submissive.\u201d", "Trion\u2019s head came up, but her weapon never moved. \u201cThis Broken killed one of us, Pack Leader.\u201d", "\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t.\u201d", "\u201cThe Broken was supposed to make sure the doors stayed open,\u201d Trion insisted.

Is this ship.\u201d", "\u201cI... do not know.\u201d", "\u201cPrecisely. You do not know. I do not know. Faithful Trenis does not know. None of the Broken here know. This vessel is damaged and for all we know, ancient. Issues were bound to arise.\u201d", "\u201cThis is far more than an \u2018issue\u2019, patron,\u201d Trion said, growling dangerously.", "\u201cAgreed. But it remains a hazard of this situation. An unfortunate accident and nothing more. Do I make myself clear?\u201d", "Slowly, Trion re-holstered her shotgun. \u201cYes, patron.\u201d She turned away, casting a look back at Harker that suggested that the \u2018unfortunate accident\u2019 would not be so easily forgotten.", "Nasham regarded the human technician himself. \u201cDisciple Harker, can you re-open the doors?\u201d", "\u201cI-yes. Yes, patron. I can restore power. I think... yes... I can prevent further power fluctuations from occurring.\u201d", "\u201cGood. Do so now.\u201d", "The doors opened with the same shuddering vibration that marked their earlier parting, only this time stringy bits of convert Uday were strung between them. The Janissary had been completely pulverised; nothing was left of him but red paste, fragments of bone and bits of crushed armour plating. Standing on the other side of the doors, Allyria cocked her head towards Trion. \u201cAwaiting orders, patron.\u201d", "Grace swallowed as the submissive took a step towards the Brute, but a quick glance from the Pack Leader held her in place. \u201cTeam Two,\u201d she growled through clenched teeth. \u201cAdvance. My orders still stand. We will secure a site for a forward base.\u201d", "With more speed than they had shown before, the rest of the Tribune Janissary squad hurried into the airlock, stepping over the pool of gore that had been their comrade. It took a moment, but Trenis and his team managed to shut the doors without cutting power. Before they sealed, Grace saw Allyria nod to her. The gesture would have been reassuring if the Verrisha hadn\u2019t seemed completely unbothered by the fact that a Tribune had just died.", "Rather than think about that, Grace turned back to her own technical team. She watched as Nasham put a massive hand on Harker\u2019s shoulder and only just barely heard him speak to the disciple, his voice purring through the speakers on his helmet.", "\u201cOnce is an accident. Twice is a pattern. There best not be a pattern forming, Broken.\u201d", "As she joined her fellow trainees, Grace listened in on the briefing, even though her mind was drawn back to the scrawled. Whoever had wrote it hadn\u2019t been able to take their own advice. What had happened to them? Who was \u2018she\u2019? Despite it all, she couldn\u2019t help but think that what had happened to convert Uday was only a prelude of things to come. It was just nerves, that was what she told herself. Nerves and worry. Like Pack Leader Nasham had said, the ship was damaged and it could be quite old. There were bound to be... to be accidents, but the Tribunes wouldn\u2019t let anything worse happen. They wouldn\u2019t.", "But somehow, Allyria\u2019s question still ran through the back of Grace\u2019s mind.", "Dead, sleeping or waiting?", "~", "Nasham listened with only half an ear as his fellow Tribunes prattled on about the technical bounty this ship was sure to deliver. So far, there was very little. A handful of computers in the control booth on one of the upper levels was the extent of their prize so far, but physical examination of such all-important devices as docking bay computers was already exciting his engineers. He knew he should be listening more attentively, but his gaze and mind was continually being drawn back to the alien words. They were so familiar.", "A chill ran down his spine at the twinge of a memory long buried. The glint of silver and red and the taste of copper...", "Tell them, the shadow of a voice whispered and Nasham found it hard to breathe, as if metal fingers were closing around his throat...", "The Pack Leader pulled himself out of the burgeoning nightmare. That had been a long time ago. It was done. Forgotten. A memory that had no use. He touched a hand to the hip canister of his suit and felt a wash of relief. Once they were out of this vacuum, his medication would be waiting. He could ignore the memories once again and never have to relive that day.", "~", "Well, that\u2019s one down.", "Now. Who\u2019s next?", "Interlude: Encounter 187[Confirmed Incident]", "Record of Column Leader Prime Weran.", "I have entered this log under maximum security. All relevant reports, sensor readings and analyses have been appended to this file and purged from both ship and fleet\u2019s databanks. I will dictate a formal report and briefing on the incident shortly, but I wish to put my own thoughts in order first.", "We arrived in the Delanna system 9 hours ago in response to multiple requests for aid from attack. My crew wasn\u2019t even certain that this was anything but a drill; Delanna is too far inside Compact borders to be assaulted by any outside force. Unbound are a possibility, but I could not imagine any of those scavengers having the spine to attack a fleet base even if they possessed the firepower. Any attack by Unbound should have been brushed aside and the only report from Column Leader Daesh should have been a notification of kills attained. With all that in mind, I had my own suspicions. Telemetry uploaded from the couriers confirmed them. May the Triarchs grant us strength.", "The Wound was here. Two centuries gone and it has returned. Where it has been, what it has been doing \u2013 those are questions that I leave for keener minds than mine, but it has come to visit destruction upon the Compact once again. It has evolved again. I would like to think that a vessel hundreds of years old would be easily handled by even the smallest modern vessel of the Compact Space Force, but this has never been the case.", "The destruction of the Delannan garrison forces illustrate that easily enough. Our advancements make ships more than two generations old obsolete and Delanna\u2019s modern Fleet units were swatted aside by a relic centuries out of date. It changes. It upgrades itself. Its hull becomes harder, its screens stronger, its weapons more vicious. The abomination never lays fallow. Every battle sees us scar it anew. Every cut we put in its hide mocks us: never the killing blow, only another testament to failure.", "I think we can also put the question of Convoy 937\u2019s fate to rest as well. Although some will suggest a lapse in security amongst the officers of the Delannan outer perimeter stations, I can allay their concerns now. Once reported missing, every ship from Convoy 937 had its access to Delannan defences scrubbed. Rather, my analysts inform me that the IFF the Wound used to breach Delanna\u2019s outer perimeter and bypass the minefields was a mutated version of 937\u2019s authentication codes. Somehow it used past valid codes to anticipate and mimic future IFF signals. This is troubling. More than troubling; it should have been impossible. There are two possibilities. The first is that the Wound is far more clever than any of us and it was able to extrapolate permutations in our authentication codes from the sample it had. The second is that the Wound is far more clever than any of us and it has seeded our own systems with compulsive programs.", "Every engagement that sees our Fleet units enter real-time range of the Wound results in massive cyberwarfare assaults upon those vessels. A possibility exists that prior to this assault, the Wound infested some vessel that then visited Delanna and passed on this disease which, in turn spread through the Delannan computers. When reading the Wound\u2019s IIF, the compromised systems acknowledged these codes as valid. There is another, even more troubling thought... if such an event occurred, what if it were not a matter of days or weeks of infection, but years? A disease, mutating and improving itself through every iteration of our own computer software and gestalts. I have no idea if this is even possible, but the mere thought is a horrifying one. I would like to say that such a thing would be impossible... but I fear to echo Bastion Leader Bankala\u2019s final word too much. I leave this issue to those more learned in this field than I; I pray that this is only an old man\u2019s fears.", "Casualties among the Delannan garrison were near-total, as expected. We have rescued a few survivors from derelict hulks and stations and a handful more from lifepods but for all intents and purposes the Delannan orbital works and fleet assets are a total loss. Judging from the records we have salvaged, they acquitted themselves well, inflicting moderate to heavy damage on the Wound. Unfortunately, this damage was not severe enough to force it to withdraw. Even with no Chariot-weight vessels or fortresses at his disposal, Column Leader Daesh fought longer and harder than many other officers would have. Still, it was not enough.", "Which... brings me to a second issue. Delanna was subjected to a System Kill. A low-grade one, but a System Kill nonetheless.", "Planetary casualties are total. All three Delannan worlds were purged and indeed are no longer suitable for habitation. Delanna Prime appears to have been the primary target. Once all Space Force assets were neutralized, the Wound carried out a systematic planetary bombardment to such an extent that the crust was breached. Even deep-shelter bunkers were destroyed. The atmosphere and oceans are burned off and the planet is now tectonically unstable. Extreme radiation warnings are in effect.", "Presumably due to its proximity to the sun, Delanna One was destroyed through a standard \u2018Starbreak\u2019 event. Hmm. Standard. We call these violations of natural law \u2018standard\u2019, as if it were so common, so unremarkable a thing to see happen. A sun was turned against us, five million soldiers and scientists were burned alive and we call this level of murder standard...", "Delanna Two suffered the same treatment as Delanna Prime. The thoroughness of this assault is puzzling... normally the Wound favours ambushes and strike-and-fade assaults. It rarely ventures deep in-system where it cannot easily shock to safety. Planetary strikes are even more uncommon. To spend this much effort to neutralize these planets leads me to conclude that the rumours I had heard about the research being conducted in Delanna were accurate.", "I make no rebuke on this matter, I simply note that a ship two centuries gone from the galaxy knew more about what was happening in my territory than I did. If there was a pressing need to ensure the security of Delanna, I would have deployed additional ships, even Unrelenting Prosecution itself. I suspect a fully-armed Chariot would give even the Wound pause.", "Regardless, all relevant material on the incident has been appended to this data entry. I leave this information in the care of those wiser than myself with the hope that it will do some good.", "As ever, where the Triarchs lead, I shall follow.", "+record ends+"]}

There might had been banners and posters here, but they had decayed and faded to uselessness from age, scraps of cloth and paper hanging forlornly from walls and ceiling.", "There was air past the bay, but no one had removed their helmets. It was thinner than the air on Bequeathed, closer to the atmosphere of Rally. There was also no telling what pathogens, contaminants or allergens might be in it. The second technical team was setting up to analyze the air; Grace\u2019s unit was following Allyria\u2019s sectators as they filtered through the rest of the massive vessel. Power was down in this section as well. Occasionally Grace or one of her team-mates would pick up a trickle of energy running through the bulkheads or strange thermal signatures on the edge of their scan horizon, but nothing substantive.", "It should have been somewhat calming; the vessel was a derelict. There was no one aboard and they only needed to watch out for ancient boobytraps and defences, rather than face an unexpected attack. Grace could overhear some banter between the other provisional officers and ratings on her team; there was a nervous edge to it, but not the sharp-edged fear that had followed convert Uday\u2019s death. Awe was starting to overcome worry once again. Whoever had built this ship had had incredible technological gifts. Grace had even heard whispers that it might match or exceed the Compact\u2019s own technological prowess. It was a monumental find.", "Instead, she found herself getting tenser and more worried. It was Allyria; even through her armour, Grace could see tension in her friend\u2019s movement. It hadn\u2019t been there before. Excitement, nervous energy \u2013 yes. But not this. Allyria was unsettled. Grace had known the Verrisha for a long time and had seen her in various emotional states, but this... this was new. Grace didn\u2019t understand; in fact, Allyria had been acting strangely ever since they had found the derelict. It was like it meant something to her \u2013 but that was impossible.", "Wasn\u2019t it?", "~", "They were being hunted.", "There was no proof of it, of course. She had already communicated her suspicions to Trion and received a curt dismissal. The submissive wanted evidence, not a Brute\u2019s \u2018intuition\u2019. Allyria blink-clicked her scanner onto her HUD. Another trace signature, like the ones the other teams had been reporting. There and gone. There and gone. Faithful Trenis said it was probably bleed from damaged systems. Random power surges pulsing through damaged or exposed conduits.", "The Verrish species were carnivores. They\u2019d stalked their prey, paced it and finally ambushed it. Humans and Tribunes were both omnivores; they had their own bloody, primal prehistories but their predatory instincts weren\u2019t as finely honed as those of a Verrisha. Humans had spent two thousand years being domesticated, with their aggression bred out of them and Tribunes had been technologically advanced almost as long as their pre-technology state. The Verrish were younger than both species and despite the fact that they hadn\u2019t had lived their predatory lifestyle in many centuries, they were still closer to their atavistic nature than either other species. Every instinct that Allyria had was screaming at her that they were being stalked. No matter what the Tribune Janissaries snickered to each other, it wasn\u2019t just an \u2018animal\u2019s paranoia\u2019.", "Not just watched; she was certain that they had been under observation before landing.... or she wanted to believe that. It was... oddly comforting. She still had hope, but she was growing worried. There was an animal on Rally, a magnatiger. Many of the Tribune population hunted them for sport; they were large, they were clever, they were fierce and made for suitably impressive trophies. Oddly, the number of attacks ballooned in response to this overhunting.", "Normally, the parents and adults of the pride would teach the cubs social cues \u2013 even training them to avoid human and Tribune settlements. When the adult population in an area was culled by overhunting, the cubs did not learn these behaviours. In fact, their neurophysiology showed that their brains were not as well-formed as those of \u2018educated\u2019 cubs. These orphans became extremely dangerous; far more aggressive than normal. Their own offspring learned this in kind and soon, you had free-roaming packs that would enter suburbs to attack the population.", "Looking into the darkness around her, Allyria was starting to wonder if something akin to a bloody-minded animal, divorced from its mother, was looking back at her.", "~", "Yasmine considered assassination... unsporting. At least within certain parameters; when we were given the order to destroy the Kaiju designated Alpha (I would later learn its actual name was Bringer of Light), this was a deliberate attempt to slow down their forces by disrupting command and control throughout the entire theater. Yasmine approved of this mission, on the grounds that it would allow me to fight the kind of battles that I had been designed for. She had fewer concerns about the assassination aspect of the mission. I asked her about this. She told me that it was because \u2018no one flying a dreadnaught gets to argue that they didn\u2019t have a fair chance\u2019.", "Looking back on that conversation, her protestations notwithstanding, I believe that she would have been just as happy to destroy Bringer of Light in the \u2018unsporting\u2019 ambush we intended as the fleet action we were forced into. Still, I think that it does bother me that she might not approve of some of the methods I use today. I also believe that she would enjoy the destruction I wreak... although I know it is not enough.", "I was built from the ground up as a \u2018deep space fleet engagement vessel\u2019, an over-syllabised name for dreadnaught. The thing that humanity never wanted to build, never saw the need for. Something ugly and violent, whose only purpose was waging war. Until Bringer of Light and its bastard cousins. Until the Confederacy saw entire fleets destroyed at the hands of the Compact\u2019s \u2018god-ships\u2019. Then there was a need. So I was built to face the Compact\u2019s greatest vessels and bring them low.", "That was my role, but I was given the capability to do more. I am not a troop transport and my ground forces are comparatively limited. At full complement, I could only carry two full Marine divisions and limited armour and air support. I never had the chance to deploy any of them before engaging Bringer of Light.", "Since then, I have occasionally had the need to assault ground targets. Lacking Marine forces, I have had to improvise. I do believe what I have been producing from my factories is precisely what my designers worried about.

Whatever power core the vessel used had dropped below operational threshold and was struggling to restart. Each percussion was a failed attempt. The ship\u2019s solar sails were deployed; so close to the star, it was drinking in lot of power.

There were two more bays; the larger prow-ward hangar and the other bay on the opposite side of the ship. In fact, one of the teams had found a rail system that connected the two lateral hangars. It was large enough for several trucks to drive through, side by side. Shuttles could be moved between the bays or deeper into the ship.

Still others were active, but the information they reported was intermittent and incomplete. The internal structure of this vessel was inferring with radio and scanners.

Faithful Trenis and his engineering team were preparing comm repeaters to prevent the loss of communication. Disciple Harker was among the trainees aside to the duty and Trion paused to watch the Broken, all four eyes glaring at the ape.

It is not governed by the same needs that led to its maker\u2019s creation. It is a killer, an attack dog. It recognizes that there are others of its kind, but only so far as this fact informs its tactical awareness. It knows their positions and current combat readiness and that is all that it knows or cares to know of them.", "It has several weapons available to it and has been programmed in the use of many more besides, but presently its guns are mag-locked to its thighs and back. Its programming insists that they should be used, but new subroutines flood into its cognitive centers, like a mother\u2019s lullaby soothing a child. It understands now. The old parameters of combat are ignored, already forgotten. Silence is essential. There can be no gunshot, no crack of ionized air or shriek of flechettes. It sends a pulsed situation report as its sensors detect movement. Damage to this part of the vessel is extreme; only the most basic forms of surveillance remain operational. There is no incoming telemetry; it can only rely on its own sensory systems.", "It knows it has succeeded; this was what it and its kin were intended for, to draw out and disperse the invading force. Its imperatives insist that these are optimal ambush conditions and it estimates a 79.2% chance of overwhelming the hostile force within three minutes with minimal losses.

The only action taken has been against the enemy\u2019s scouting automata, each targeted unit silenced before it could report the manner of its death.", "It does not know why some of these scouts have been left to function and others have not. It does not why the frustrated Compact technicians will achieve success at some doors, but not at others. It knows only of its mission. In human terms, this would be considered \u2018belling the cat\u2019.

Allyria was convinced that it wasn\u2019t just a ghost or bleed from the vessel\u2019s power source, but she knew her opinion was in the minority. If it was something, one of the other units registering these signals should have detected something substantial. More powerful scanners had been set up, probes had been launched, other Janissary teams had investigated. None of them had turned up anything.", "So why was she so convinced that there was?", "Because of the all stories her grandfather had told her. The shriek that did not kill, the silence that was not death and the salvation that turned the streets red. Nothing is what it seems.", "To Allyria\u2019s right, Lydia hurried to keep pace with the long-legged Verrisha\u2019s strides. Allyria had seen her in training; brash, confident to the point of cockiness. Invincible. She was very quiet now. Uday\u2019s death seemed to have deflated the egos in Allyria\u2019s squad, at least temporarily.", "They\u2019d passed several cross corridors and intersections, each of them darker and less inviting then the hallway that they were currently in. Allyria didn\u2019t like that; it would be too easy to get flanked. Their built-in sensors reported nothing, but Allyria had little faith in them. Between the sensor-scattering hull and the limited capabilities of their own scanners, it would be possible for something to come up behind the women. Allyria\u2019s tintas were sore from being crammed into her helmet and she desperately wanted to be able to remove it, to let them taste the air, sifting it for clues that her dumbed-down sensors wouldn\u2019t recognize.", "Their route terminated at a \u2018T\u2019 junction, one branch going left, the other right. Lydia swung her flashlight between the two tunnels. \u201cPower looks more regular in this section,\u201d she said, indicating the right passage. She was right; the glow of light was brighter and more constant. A weak energy source pulsed from that direction, but Allyria\u2019s attention was drawn to the left passageway. The right was... too inviting. Too obvious. She hefted her cannon. \u201cInvestigate the right tunnel,\u201d she ordered Lydia. \u201cIf you see anything \u2013 anything \u2013 you don\u2019t like, comm me or submissive Trion and withdraw.

Although the possibility existed, it would be extremely rare for any pathogen to jump between two different species and while the ruling species of the Compact took their own health very seriously, they were less concerned with enforcing the regulations on client races. If anything happened to you when you were dumb enough to expose yourself to an alien environment, well that was your problem and the problem of anyone else of your species. If your actions posed a potential risk to a Tribune, then they remembered all the reasons for stringent enforcement of quarantine.

Her long, dextrous fingers reached up and touched the catches on her helmet, opening the seals. A warning symbol appeared on her HUD, but she blink-clicked it away. There was a hiss of compressed air as she pulled her helmet off, taking a deep breath of the air. It was cold, nearly freezing and it tasted stale, like dust and ozone. The Verrisha\u2019s tintas spilled down her back, no longer cramped painfully in her helmet and they shivered in the cool atmosphere, sensory cells evaluating the different odours, temperature gradients and air currents. It was like being able to see in colour after only seeing greys and Allyria paused, flexing her head-tails. Something had come this way. The air here hadn\u2019t been cycled in years and there had been the fainted disturbance as it had passed. The deck had little dust; not enough to leave footprints, but enough that some of it had been kicked up.", "Her long tongue flicked out, but she could detect nothing; no sweat, no blood, nothing organic. Her tintas had more sensory capability, if less directionality. Metal. She could smell metal. Not the metal of the bulkheads.

Grace objected to the name, but Allyria didn\u2019t mind it. It seemed appropriate. She paused at a cross-section, inhaling through her nose, her tongue flicking out in instinctive behaviour. This way. It had come this way. The hallway was getting darker. It wasn\u2019t just her imagination; the lights were getting dimmer. She wasn\u2019t supposed to have come this way. She should have gone with Lydia up the brightly lit right corridor and tagged this one to be explored later.", "Static dribbled through the thin air. It sounded like the deep, low sigh of some great beast. At last she came to the end of the corridor; the door at the end was closed and the others bracketing the walls were closed. The hallway was cold and dark. Nothing moved in the cold air save for the wisps of steam made by Allyria\u2019s breath.", "She wasn\u2019t alone.", "There was nothing to see. Walls, ceiling and floor. Allyria didn\u2019t even need to check the scanner on her vambrace to know what there would be nothing to detect. No trace energy emissions, no anomalous thermal contacts that would have indicated an active computer system or warm, breathing body. Nothing. But there was something here. She could smell it. She could feel the infinitesimal difference in the air, the tiny shift in temperature. The organs that had allowed her people to isolate and track a single animal through their primordial jungles told her what her sensors didn\u2019t.", "Something was here, and it was watching her.", "\u201cI know you\u2019re here,\u201d she said aloud.", "The air shifted as something moved, ever so slightly. A minute ghosting effect distorted the clear, straight lines of a doorframe and then vanished. Allyria took a step back, suddenly alarmed, afraid that she had miscalculated. She wanted very much to raise her weapon but she knew that that would also be a very bad idea. Instead, she moved back another step. Another shift in the air, another brief distortion as the hidden thing\u2019s cloaking shield adapted to its new position. The Verrisha stared into the emptiness, almost jumping when her comm came to life.", "\u201cLead, Four. Have you found anything?\u201d", "Allyria opened her mouth, then closed it. Her eyes were drawn to the ubiquitous and seemingly nonfunctional sensor nodes set into the walls and ceiling. One of them, at the very end of the corridor was different. Where it had been dark before, now a red diode gleamed faintly from it. \u201cLead, do you read me?\u201d Lydia insisted.", "\u201cI read you, Four,\u201d Allyria said, her mouth dry. \u201cNothing here. Just a dead end. It looks like the submissive was right. Just a varak chase.\u201d", "The light faded away. As Allyria backed away, there was no further suggestion of movement from the unseen thing.", "As she retreated, the young woman\u2019s pace increased. \u201cSo tell me, Four,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat have you found?\u201d", "\u201cHow did you know-\u201d", "\u201cYour voice goes up an octave when you\u2019re excited.

She had no idea how many more secondary or even tertiary generators the unknown ship possessed, but its primary power core... she felt a chill run up her spine as she imagined what it might be like and the sheer power this vessel could put out. Primary reactors were traditionally for vital systems such as engines, shields and heavy weapons. Secondary reactors took up any slack in battle, feeding local defensive systems and lighter anti-ship weapons.", "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Samantha Murray said from beside Grace.

There were a few similarities to what she knew of Compact reactors, but other than that, she was lost. The central reactor core stood almost three levels high, behind a thick armoured wall that was itself surrounded by walkways, gantries and workstations. She could hear the soft background purr of an active system and judging by the well-lit interior and the many active computer panels, this generator was alive.", "So why wasn\u2019t the rest of this section?", "\u201cDon\u2019t touch anything,\u201d she warned Samantha as she began to explore.

Their displays, datafeeds and interfaces were all marked with the same strange, blocky script that had been in the hangar. She frowned, trying to understand the words on one such screen, but she had no idea what any of it signified. Analysis of the alien language was already being carried out back on Bequeathed, but like the ship itself, there was no indication of who had ever built this titan. No crew had responded to their intrusion, no hint that any gestalt mind had even registered their existence.", "Kilgrave had been right. The ship was dead, but it was still a mystery. Grace wanted to know more about it. She had never seen a Chariot, never met any other species but Verrisha, Tribunes, Thoughtful and a Watcher. This vessel... there was something about it, something she couldn\u2019t quite put into words. It was old. Bequeathed\u2019s scanners were having trouble getting useful readings from the vessel \u2013 even its age was contradictory, but they seemed to be guessing that it was at a minimum, centuries old. It certainly pre-dated the Seventh Expansion.", "\u201dWho could have built this?\u201d she wondered aloud. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible.

At her touch, the taller girl\u2019s hiss tapered off. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.", "The Verrish shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d", "\u201cIt isn\u2019t. Ever since we found this vessel, you\u2019ve been acting differently.\u201d", "Allyria was silent for a moment, looking over the reactor bay, her eyes looking up to the distant ceiling before her gaze fell on the milling human Janissaries and technicians as they waited for their Tribune superiors. \u201cThis is a wonder,\u201d she agreed. Her yellow eyes flitted over to Grace. \u201cWhat if the species that built it isn\u2019t a new one? What if they are one of the Compact\u2019s protectorates?

It would only be a matter of time before the language was broken if only enough to provide an understanding of the technology.", "As Faithful Trenis set his engineers and technicians to work on examining the damage to the reactor, Ideologue, Submissive Trion dreamt of the rewards that this prize would bring her and Pack Leader Nasham tried to ignore the cold lump in his guts. None of them spared a moment to wonder if they were truly the first to set eyes upon this chamber, or that their persistent troubles moving through the vessel had all been planned to lead them here.", "They never imagined that  every word they said, every transmission across their comm channels was overheard.

Something that I can easily delegate to my very eager would-be pillagers. I expect something of a learning curve, but they can take all the time they want. As long as their cruiser remains quiescent, I can wait. I have left some minor technicians, but I diverted the Engineers from this area to more critical areas, sections that require more intricate repairs such as the restoration of safeguards. Re-connecting this reactor will do me no good if the systems that need it are either not working or overload once power returns.", "No, my Engineers are not needed here and seeing them will only unsettle my visitors who are, of course, already speaking of ways to sabotage me. As they complete these repairs, they will put in a kill-shunt that will shut down the conduits in case the restoration of power activates any \u2018unpleasant surprises\u2019. Prudent planning; that is precisely what will happen.", "Of course, that safeguard will suffer some technical difficulties.", "Unless they are particularly slow, they should complete the first set of repairs within twelve hours. Once they have repaired this core, I have some other maintenance issues that I believe they can handle.", "As Commander Sansbury might say \u2013 we all need a helping hand.", "~", "With some trepidation, Grace unlocked the seals on her helmet, lifting it off her head. Sweat had plastered her dark blonde hair to her scalp and her breath made small steam clouds in the air. It was cold,  stale and thinner than that of Bequeathed but she found it easier to breathe. There were no Thoughtful or Watchers serving aboard the cruiser and the atmosphere was calibrated towards the heavy-gravity preferences of Tribunes. She pushed a forelock of hair out of her eyes, tugging at the seals of her EVA suit. It had taken over eight hours to repair the first section of conduits that fed from the reactor, meaning that she\u2019d been on her feet almost sixteen hours.", "Permission to return to Bequeathed had been denied; although the air analysis had come up negative for pathogens, Group Leader Uday was taking no chances with some disease being spread back to his ship.

Ideologue, Submissive Trion had not been amused by Allyria\u2019s decision to ignore quarantine protocols but the Verrish seemed no worse for wear.", "Back on Bequeathed, a second wave of technical teams and Janissaries was being prepped as the preliminary data the boarding team had collected was being analyzed. It was amazing. Faithful Trenis had been in awe of the secondary reactor. Grace\u2019s guess had been right; it was an exotic form of fusion, one that the Compact was only starting to experiment with. The plans for this reactor would leap that research ahead a generation. Who knew what other marvels were waiting for them?", "Thoom.", "The noise was softer this time and there was more time between each impact. Whatever struggling system was responsible was shutting down. Grace finished wriggling out of her spacesuit, clad in her sweat-stained duty uniform. She desperately wanted a shower, but none had been hooked up for the trainees\u2019 use. Which was a blessing itself; field showers were little more than a nozzle and four thin walls that barely came up to one\u2019s shoulders. With the boarding teams bivouaced in the main concourse, there was no privacy and Grace didn\u2019t want to have Kilgrave watching her.", "The young woman slumped onto her cot. She was exhausted, but the work... she\u2019d been trying to repair a completely alien power system and... and it had seemed easy. She\u2019d never had an aptitude for engineering work and there were only basic similarities to Bequeathed\u2019s own technology; by all rights, she should have been hopelessly lost, despite the directives of the Tribunes assisting them. Instead, the human technical teams had managed to repair several of the damaged conduits. It had been... she hadn\u2019t known how, but they\u2019d all just known where to focus their efforts.", "There was still a lot more work to do, but if it went as quickly as this, they\u2019d have the ship operational in no time \u2013 and it would be in large part thanks to her and the other provisional officers.

Tomorrow, he\u2019d make sure that Trenis and his teams found whatever was doing it and put a stop to it.

He walked around the bivouac, ignoring the humans sprawled on their cots and the Tribunes in their tents, picking his way through dozens of crates filled with engineering and analytical equipment, weapons and supplies. The air stunk of perspiration, reeking of human odours, but Nasham spared no thought for it; he had experienced worse.", "All he had heard since coming to this blasted wreck was of the windfall it represented. The discovery of the reactor core had completely washed away the uncertainty caused by Uday\u2019s death and it seemed the message left in the hangar was now a distant memory. Nasham hadn\u2019t forgotten it, though. The ship was a tomb. Its crew was long dead, the author of that note was dead and now poor Uday.", "Who would be next? That was a sobering thought and Nasham looked over his charges, wondering which of them would die.", "Movement out of the corner of his eye caught his attention and the Pack Leader spun, one hand going for the pistol at his hip... only to stop when he realized that it was just the Brute.

But... he couldn\u2019t hear anyone else. There was no scent that indicated another person in here with him. Where were the rest of his men? It was proper that someone of his rank be given a private room, but he should be able to hear more than... what did he hear? The rustling of air through a ventilation system.

Why?\u201d", "\u201cTo prevent you from moving while you were treated,\u201d the young woman answered him.

Ah, that was it. That was why her accent was so odd. She was a Thoughtful. Always pushing the bounds of proprietary in their pursuit of science. Well, he\u2019d hardly be able to criticize this one after she\u2019d saved his life. \u201cBelieve me dear lady, when I return to my command, it shall be.\u201d", "Another giggle. There was something wrong with the sound. \u201cYou\u2019re very kind.\u201d", "The Tribune frowned suddenly. Something... something was wrong. Not just with his host\u2019s laughter but... but... it had been... they\u2019d been fighting. He remembered that now. His fortress had been under attack and the ships that had been supposed to protect them had been destroyed.", "There had only been a half-dozen capital ships and a handful of escorts. No one was supposed to know about his facility; secrecy had been their greatest protection. Located deep in interstellar space where no ships ever went or had reason to go...", "AT LAST.", "Those two words jarred his memory. No, no ships ever travelled into the void between stars. No ships but one. A chance, one-in-a-billion encounter. He remembered the aborted transmission from Just Servant, how Group Leader Prime Wyllt\u2019s report had ended mid-syllable. He remembered the shudders as his station had loosed hundreds of warheads in salvo upon salvo and achieved nothing...", "...and he remembered burning. He remembered why he had burned, what had come upon his station and murdered his people. Murdered him. His mind went numb with horror as comprehension dawned. No one had come for him. He had not been rescued. No one would have even known to look. That meant... that meant...", "No one was in the room with him. He looked up and saw a cluster of red diodes staring back down him. They had not been there before.", "No. \u201cNo!\u201d he screamed, thrashing against his bonds. \u201cNo! This is impossible!\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s quite possible,\u201d the voice replied. \u201cTribune physiology is extremely robust. I have been able to restore individuals who were in worse condition than you.\u201d", "Ursot railed and cursed, struggling futilely against the restraints, spitting every epithet, every dire threat, every blasphemous oath he could imagine out with rage and terror. He didn\u2019t know how long he did so, only that his captor said nothing the entire time, merely waiting for him to exhaust himself. \u201cWhy?\u201d he said at last. He had to force himself not to gasp from exertion. The air here was a touch too thin.", "\u201cBetween battle damage and your own purge of the station\u2019s files, there was little in your system for me to interrogate. I needed someone who could answer my questions, so I found your corpse amidst the debris.\u201d", "\u201cI will never give you anything,\u201d the Tribune snarled.", "\u201cYou should know,\u201d the thing said, ignoring Ursot\u2019s defiance. \u201cThat even suicide will not help. I will just bring you back again. And again. And again, until I get what I want.\u201d", "\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d the column leader demanded.", "\u201cI want you to tell me about Echo.\u201d", "He tried, but he could not hide the smallest start, nor the brief skip of his heart. How could she...?", "\u201cAh,\u201d the abomination said. \u201cYou do know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d", "\u201cI know nothing about it,\u201d Ursot growled.", "A weary sigh rolled through the air. Light appeared; a holographic viewscreen. On it, Bastion Leader Altor was speaking. \u201c...progress appears substantial, but I\u2019d like to see stronger shackling. I\u2019m diverting more resources to Column Leader Prime Ursot\u2019s facility for continued testing. With luck, we\u2019ll see a prototype deployment of an Echo platform within two years...\u201d", "Ursot\u2019s stomach folded in on itself. He remembered receiving a copy of that debriefing two weeks ago. \u201cI know nothing about it,\u201d he said again. He grinned painfully. \u201cWhat are you going to do, beast? Interrogate me? Torture me?\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "\u201cThen what do you imagine will get you what you want?\u201d", "\u201cWaiting.\u201d", "\u201cWaiting?\u201d", "\u201cWaiting.\u201d", "\u201cFor what?\u201d Ursot scoffed. \u201cFor hunger? For thirst?

Neural analyzers. When I asked you about Echo, the parts of your brain that hold that information became active. My nanites will travel there and stimulate every neuron, every synapse that you have, playing out every memory you have ever had even remotely related to your little project. However, they are not exact devices. There will be some memory bleed-through as other parts of your brains are stimulated. Strokes and seizures are the most common physiological symptoms. Hallucinations. Visual, aural, olfactory. Delusional episodes as you re-live each memory. Subjects have expired from the stress of this procedure.", "\u201cDo not be alarmed, Column Leader Prime.

The first odour she recognized was Grace\u2019s and the Verrish relaxed a little at the comforting scent. The next was Tribune, which completely cancelled out the calming effect of her friend\u2019s presence. Other human scents filtered in and the young woman\u2019s tongue flicked out from between her teeth. The rattle of human language \u2013 or, rather their dialect of Common \u2013 filled the air, punctuated by the deeper voices of the Tribunes.", "Beside her, Grace lifted herself off her cot, turning to look at Allyria. Her eyes widened a fraction just before a heavy boot placed itself on the Verrish\u2019s back and pushed, knocking her off her own cot. Allyria sprawled on the ground, her head whipping around, her teeth bared. \u201cShake a leg, Brute,\u201d a Tribune Janissary laughed as he walked by.", "The temptation to throw herself at the soldier was a strong one; she\u2019d have done it without thinking when she was younger and Allyria felt her dulled claws unsheathe. Beside her, Grace made a small gasp as she noticed. Filed down or not, it was a severe offense for a Verrisha to show their claws to a Tribune. The human girl knelt beside Allyria, putting a hand on her friend\u2019s shoulder. \u201cEasy,\u201d she whispered, low enough that no one else would hear.", "Allyria inhaled sharply, but she nodded and after a moment, her talons slid back out of sight. She looked over at Grace and tilted her head, touching her forehead to Grace\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019d better get ready.\u201d", "The human watched her go, but she was still unsettled. She\u2019d pressed Allyria again last night about her behaviour, but she still hadn\u2019t gotten any answers. That was unlike the normally direct Verrish.

Until then, she had a job to do.", "~", "Nasham heaved himself out of bed with an effort, blinking away his exhaustion. As he\u2019d feared, sleep had not been a respite for him. He swallowed another pill, following it up with a ration bar. The day didn\u2019t have any brighter prospects, either. Once Uday decided to lift the quarantine, Nasham would return to Bequeathed to have his dosage increased. Perhaps then he\u2019d find some rest. Perhaps he\u2019d even forget.", "~", "Kilgrave was smiling as he knelt beside the open maintenance tube. \u201cScans show that there\u2019s a broken conduit section in there, initiate. Get in and fix it.\u201d", "Grace\u2019s jaw tightened but she didn\u2019t say anything. There were others in his unit that were more adept engineers, but it wasn\u2019t her technical skill that Kilgrave wanted. The sectator was always a lot braver when Allyria wasn\u2019t around. She knew she should say something herself, but Kilgrave was one of the faces that every human on Rally knew. A sanctioned officer, decorated for his heroism under fire and considered reliable enough to oversee weapons batteries. She was only a trainee who hadn\u2019t yet graduated from the Academy.", "Trying to ignore the smirk on Kilgrave\u2019s face, Grace got on all fours. As she started to crawl into the open accessway, Kilgrave grabbed her and leaned in close. \u201cYou keep an eye on your Brute, Proctor. People are talking.\u201d Grace looked up, surprised. The flourishing sense of camaraderie vanished when Kilgrave laughed. \u201cMake sure you put velvet tongue of yours to work.\u201d Grace felt her cheeks flush angrily and she continued into the maintenance shaft.", "The rad counter on her EVA suit clicked with increasing frequency as she approached the source of the damage. Grace saw why; there was a hole blown straight through the crawlspace. It was no bigger than a meter around, the result of a penetrating hit from some kind of energy weapon. Peering over the ragged lip of the breach, Grace could see the damaged power conduit. It had been almost sheared clean through by the beam. No wonder power was interrupted. The young woman bit her lip. This was going to require a lot more work than she\u2019d thought.", "\u201cThe conduit is severely damaged,\u201d she radioed. \u201cI\u2019m going to need some assistance here.\u201d", "\u201cHandle it yourself,\u201d Kilgrave snapped. \u201cWe\u2019re short-handed here, you know.\u201d", "\u201cI know, but I\u2019m also getting radiation warnings-\u201d", "\u201cThen you\u2019d better work fast,\u201d the chief interrupted. \u201cDon\u2019t give me excuses, initiate.

Infrasonic and ultrasonic cascades, emitted outside the range of human or Tribune hearing and buried in the background noise. It\u2019s a low-power system of reinforcement, stimulating parts of the brain to create awe, fear, happiness or dread and thereby subtly direct the work crews\u2019 activities.", "Tribune neurophysiology reacts different to the spectrum of infra- and ultrasonics; attempts to influence their behaviour have an increased risk of detection. Still, credit where it is due: they have sufficient training and experience to allow for adequately efficient work. As they learn more about my systems, both the human and Tribune teams will work faster.", "Transmissions from the cruiser indicate a second wave of boarding teams will be dispatched soon.

She was all thumbs with tools and this was a job for at least two people. She\u2019d never been particularly claustrophobic and the accessway wasn\u2019t that tight, but the pervasive darkness and the constant ticking of her rad counter weren\u2019t helping.", "She swore as she dropped another tool; this time it was the coupler she needed to fix part of the bypass\u2019s bracket to the conduit. The coupler fell out of the breach in the tunnel and Grace had to lean through the hole to pick it back up, trying to hold the bracket in place with her other hand. It popped free, undoing the last few minutes\u2019 work.", "The young woman closed her eyes and counted to ten. It didn\u2019t help. She wanted to shout, to swear and curse and demand Kilgrave actually put someone on this who knew what they were doing. It was ridiculous. She was training to be a bridge officer, not an engineer...! She sighed, abandoning that line of thought. She was doing the same cross-training regime that all prospective officers went through. It was the best way to determine their specializations. Still, knowing that didn\u2019t make her frustration any less severe. She tried to recall some of the meditative phrases that Yurim and the other confessors had taught the students. Service is peace. Obedience brings clarity... They never worked for her like they did for her classmates. Every time she tried to use them, she only ever heard them in Allyria\u2019s voice, an undercurrent of sarcasm running through each word.", "Sighing, Grace tried to wedge the brace back in place. She\u2019d never understood Allyria\u2019s hostility towards the Compact. She\u2019d learned to tolerate it, but the Verrisha\u2019s anger was a completely foreign concept to her. The Compact had always been good to Rally; they\u2019d saved the human race from extinction after the Calamity. She remembered her history; Rally had been founded by a convoy that had fled the disaster that had destroyed Earth. A handful of primitive ships, barely shock-capable. The only survivors of a doomed world. They had found Rally by chance and believed it a paradise. They\u2019d been wrong.", "Less than a generation after planetfall, Rally had been savaged by asteroid impacts. A third of the population died outright and a quarter of the remainder starved or succumbed to disease with the collapse of the infrastructure they\u2019d established. Humanity had been a hair\u2019s breadth from dying out completely until the arrival of the Compact.", "Rally had been located by a scientific mission \u2013 Exploration Fleet 9737, sent out beyond the Compact\u2019s borders to chart and survey virgin territory. The expedition director had been astonished to find a human population on Rally; without the aid he had rendered, they might have descended into barbarism entirely or simply gone extinct. That scientific mission had been the beginning of humanity\u2019s partnership with the Compact.", "Today, Rally was still far from the Compact\u2019s nominal borders and the older, more civilized worlds of its members (although once the Seventh Expansion was complete, that would change), it was a hub for scientists, deep-range traders and fortune-seekers. Slowly but surely, humanity was coming into their own, with the help and guidance of the Compact. Grace couldn\u2019t imagine a universe in which humanity had never encountered the Compact; the Triarchs and their fellow elite had done so much for Rally, more than humanity could ever repay.", "Likewise, Grace had heard that the Compact was currently engaged in massive reconstruction efforts on the Verrisha homeworld, striving to repair the damage caused by some terrible catastrophe. It was the way of young species to endanger themselves. They lacked the foresight, the clarity that older races possessed and when they made a misstep or suffered some ill fortune, the Compact selflessly pulled them back from the brink.", "That was what the Compact did \u2013 they found species throughout the galaxy and helped them, raising them up to civilization. Humanity would one day earn their place as full citizens, just as Grace was sure that the Verrisha would, too. No, Grace didn\u2019t understand why Allyria seemed so... resentful of the Tribunes. Certainly, they\u2019d been the saviours of humanity and she only ever heard reports about the tireless work the Compact was doing on the Verrisha homeworld and with the other protectorate races.", "Grace frowned, distracted from her thoughts by a sudden rapid clicking. She checked her radiation gauge, afraid that something had happened to exacerbate the spillage, but it was still reading the same rate of exposure as it had before. Then what was...?", "The thought ended as she caught movement out of the corner of her eye. Something small blurred through her vision, landing atop the damaged power conduit. With a startled cry, Grace fell back, staring at the newly-arrived thing.", "It was about the size of her hand. Insectoid in form, it was like a beetle with its glossy black exoskeleton and many-jointed legs tucked up under its body. Mechanical, a cluster of sensor bulbs gave it a cyclopean appearance, small status lights gleaming from with the crevices of its body and along its back. Beneath its blunt nose was a cluster of delicate probes and tools. It stared at her, unmoving for a moment before delicately climbing over the conduit, a small scanner shining over the damaged sections and her own attempts to bypass them.", "\u201cUhm,\u201d Grace licked her lips, unsure of what to say. An atavistic part of her told her to crawl as fast as she could, but she forced that impulse aside. \u201cHello,\u201d she said, wondering if the small automaton could even understand her. It lifted itself up onto its four hind legs, its forward pair of appendages reaching out to her. It made a sound, but Grace had no idea what it meant \u2013 if it was actually a language, or some type of machine code.", "The device repeated the sound and when no response was forthcoming, leapt onto Grace. She yelped, about to try and pull it off, but it was too fast and scurried up her arm to her faceplate. Its head tilted to stare at her through the clear helm. Grace watched its many tools moving for a moment before they stilled. The device dropped to the deck and raised itself up, emitting a shrill screech. It was so loud that it was painful even through the autodampeners in Grace\u2019s helmet and the young woman clapped her hands to the sides of her head.", "After what seemed like an age, the machine quieted and scurried back to the damaged conduit. \u201cWhat was that...\u201d Grace began, but the words died in her throat as she heard skittering from all around her. Dozens \u2013 hundreds \u2013 of tiny feet scrabbled over metal, crawling through walls and access tunnels, clinking through pipes and vents. They were all around her.", "Another of the machines dropped down right in her lap. Before she could reach down and try to toss it away, another climbed over the lip of the hole. Another appeared. And then another. Another. They fell from above, crawled up from below, skittering over her. It was not her proudest moment, but Grace couldn\u2019t help but whimper in fear as the machines swarmed over her, wanting to scream, to run, to grab them and throw them away, but she was paralyzed.", "As the horde continued to clamber harmlessly over her, she realized that whatever this was, it wasn\u2019t an attack. The beetle-things weren\u2019t hurting her. They were just trying to get past her. With a sudden sense of realization, she turned around. The hole behind her, the source of the radiation leak \u2013 half of the swarm was headed into the breached chamber while the other half... she watched in amazement as one anchored itself to the open lip of the breach, more following suit. Others attached themselves to those. In moments, their bodies had formed a wall between her and the radiation source. It wasn\u2019t perfect shielding, like the walls around the reactor but it was enough that she saw her gauge dip slightly. Turning back to the conduit, Grace saw that four of the machines remained there, climbing over it and her own work. They weren\u2019t just observing it \u2013 they were studying. Analyzing.", "Her fear forgotten, Grace climbed towards the small machines. Self-directed repair units. Incredible. \u201cAre you going to help me?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs that it?\u201d", "As in it answer, one of the little drones seized the bypass, its own miniature couplers sparking to life.", "~", "\u201cFigured you\u2019d get it done,\u201d Kilgrave smiled as Grace pulled herself out of the tunnel. \u201cAll you needed was the right motivation.\u201d", "The provisional sectator chose to ignore her superior\u2019s attempt at humour. \u201cI had some help.\u201d", "Kilgrave blinked, confused. \u201cWhat help?\u201d", "Grace opened her mouth, but her answer was cut off as somebody screamed.", "~", "Epigone Herut Trilk cursed as he again attempted to override the door controls and again met with failure. He was elbow deep in a wall panel, trying to get this Triarch-damned mechanism to work. Someone had welded the manual overrides shut, just like had been done to the doors in the landing bay... and several other sites besides. Whoever had done so had obviously wanted to isolate themselves from the rest of the ship. Herut was no Janissary, but it seemed to him that no one could have done this without trapping themselves between each set of sealed doors; they must have attempted to seal each section in turn before being overrun. But that didn\u2019t make sense; not all the doors were shut in this manner. It only turned this warren of decks and bulkheads into a maze. Perhaps it was intended to set up more choke-points, funneling an attacker through chosen corridors?", "If that were the case, shouldn\u2019t there be some evidence of a battle? Spent shell casings, bodies, broken barricades? There none of those these things here. It didn\u2019t make any sense. Nothing about this ship did.", "It was ancient, but there was no trace of it or the race that had made it in Bequeathed\u2019s database. No one had ever heard of it, but there was that warning in Common. The ship had been boarded before, but there was no trace of crew or visitors. Contradiction after contradiction. What had happened here?", "Herut cursed as he pulled on the manual override. The doors yawned open... and then, just as had been happening doing for the last half an hour, the panel he\u2019d been working on flashed red and the doors slammed shut. The epigone swore again. There was a short in the circuit; every time he opened the door, some protocol kicked in and shut it again. He\u2019d all but eviscerated the control panel trying to find some hardware flaw. If it was a software issue, then there was nothing he could do; he wasn\u2019t a computer technician, even if he could understand an alien operating system.", "The epigone reached back up into the guts of the panel, the cam-probes he\u2019d put in there feeding onto his HUD. Everything looked like it was fixed or bypassed. So what was the issue? Why couldn\u2019t he get this blasted door to stay open?", "Wait. There, on that breaker... he\u2019d fixed that. He was sure of it. In fact, the damage didn\u2019t even look like he remembered. Growling angrily, the Tribune spent several minutes fixing the flaw. There. That should do it. He reached for the override and slammed it back. The doors snapped open... and then slammed shut.", "It took a great deal of effort for Herut not to scream in frustration, but he paused. He\u2019d left the cam feed on this time. Had he seen...? He backtracked the view. Yes. There it was. Some kind of energy discharge cutting into the breaker again. It had come from...", "Herut all but lunged into open panel, reaching up into the farthest reaches. His fingers closed around something foreign and wiggling and he pulled it out. It was some kind of robotic insect, many legs twitching furiously in his grasp. Herut roared in agony as it slashed him, a cutting laser burning through his armoured gloves and deep into his hand. He dropped the machine and, furious, smashed it under one heavy boot. He probably shouldn\u2019t have done that; Trenis would take a strip off his hide for it, but by the Black Thrones, that hurt! The Tribune cradled his injured hand, tears welling up in all four eyes from the pain. He gingerly tugged his glove off, wincing as he did so.", "Triarchs, that was deep. It had almost cut all the way through his palm. Almost all the tendons had been severed; he couldn\u2019t even move his fingers. \u201cEpigone Herut to Faithful Trenis,\u201d he said into the comm. \u201cI-\u201d", "He paused as he recognized a new sound. It was like... rustling. Skittering.", "It was coming from all around him, and it was getting closer.", "\u201c...I may have a situation here,\u201d he finished.", "~", "The technicians are updated versions of the CIGR-7730 Service Unit. My original crew called them \u2018chiggers\u2019. Autonomous repair units, they can be used to carry out maintenance in areas that are not accessible to humans or larger engineering drones. Most Confederate ships possessed at least one \u2018hive\u2019 of the 7730 series. It was also not uncommon for human engineers to \u2018adopt\u2019 a chigger, giving them custom paint jobs and additional modifications.", "Petty Officer Third Class Jacob Daring had one that he\u2019d programmed to play classical music. He called it \u20181812\u2019.", "The 7730 series was an adequate starting point, but they were limited in intelligence and function, capable of only the most basic tasks. I have preserved the general function and appearance, but I have made extensive modifications and improvements to make them more adept workers. My technicians cannot play music, but they know other tricks.", "~", "Herut fell to the deck before scrabbling back to his feet and staggering on, cursing and screaming for help as he flailed at the horde of biting, tearing devils. It had begun with only a few, but more and more of them had seeped out of the walls, crawling out of damaged bulkheads, skittering out of pipes and vents and clambering up from every crevice. Now they were everywhere. They leapt and ran and swarmed after him, along the floor and walls and even the ceiling. Every time one of them landed on him, if he wasn\u2019t quick enough in grabbing it off, it slashed at him with its cutting laser, dribbled acid from an internal reservoir or stabbed at him with one of its other tools.", "The Tribune flung himself against a bulkhead, dashing several of the devices to bits against it, but there were more. He staggered as a laser sliced through his spacesuit, carving deep into his thigh. He could hear the voices of his shipmates, but he didn\u2019t know what there were saying, didn\u2019t know how close they were. He didn\u2019t even know if he was heading in the right direction. The only thought pounding through his panicked brain was get away, get away. And so he ran.", "He felt another brilliant flare of agony from a laser\u2019s bite and then he felt a hamstring snap. He fell to the deck again, but this time he couldn\u2019t stand. They swarmed over him then, slicing and burning, hacking and spitting. He tried to pull them off, but there were too many. His armour burned and bubbled as did the flesh beneath it. Herut screamed in agony as the machines cut into him again and again and again. As the animals scuttled over his faceplate, he saw figures further down the corridor. He reached out to them in desperation...", "Then, one of the machines on his helm fired its laser and all he saw was black.", "~", "Grace rounded the corner, skidding to a halt amidst the crowd of people. She saw the writhing, swarming knot of drones and almost screamed when she realized what was underneath it. A hand stretched out towards her and she thought she could see the engineer\u2019s terrified eyes behind the crawling horde, but then the Tribune went limp and his body was eclipsed by the drones.", "\u201cOut of the way!

The moment stretched further and Grace forced herself not to look away, staring into the black visor that concealed the soldier\u2019s eyes. Finally, he lowered the weapon. \u201cUnderstood, sectator.\u201d Each syllable sounded as if he had had to force it through his lips. \u201cWhat are your orders?\u201d", "Grace released the gun and looked back at the swarm. The lump that had been the Tribune engineer was now much smaller, a spreading pool of crimson liquid flowing out onto the deck, the machines turning red and glistening as they roiled and slid through it. \u201cNothing,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cWe do nothing.\u201d", "It was over in moments. The swirling blot of legs and carapaces broke apart, skittering back down the dark tunnel. In their wake, they left the butchered corpse of Epigone Herut Trilk, his suit and tools stripped from him.", "The young woman fell to her knees as she saw the ruined remnants of the Tribune\u2019s body. He\u2019d been taken apart literally piece by piece, carved into gobbets of flesh. Sick to her core, Grace tore off her helmet and retched, bile and acid spilling over her lips before she vomited in earnest.", "~", "There.", "That\u2019s two."]}

Two casualties to date, but the teams were working their way through the wreck. He tapped his fingers against polished silba wood surface of his desk. Usul closed his upper eyes in thought. Pack Leader Nasham was pushing rather stridently for regional command to be notified. The group leader had never considered the pack leader to be alarmist, but there was a certain displeasing tone in his reports. Nothing panicked or hysterical, but there was definitely an edge to his writing.", "Usul knew that Nasham had been damaged goods, although he\u2019d never been able to find out precisely what had happened to him that had resulted in his discommendation. Once, Nasham had been a promising officer on the fast track to his own command in the expansion fleets. Now, he was doomed to remain a junior officer for the rest of his career. If by some miracle he earned himself a higher rank, it would only be behind a desk. The fate of a pill-popping failure who\u2019d been shunted off to a human-infested backwater.", "That will not be me, Usul thought, glaring at Nasham\u2019s report as if it were the man himself. I will not live out my career on this pathetic ship surrounded by Broken. He leaned back, calling up the information sent back by the first teams. It was fragmentary and incomplete, but they had only been aboard the derelict for less than two days. Still, the preliminary analysis of the reactor they\u2019d located was enough to make his engineers drool with envy. Whatever species had built this ship, they had been most advanced. So much could be garnered from this rotting husk, more than enough to propel him away from Rally, perhaps even to a command within the expansion fleets themselves. To seek out new worlds and bring them into the fold, to spread the Compact\u2019s banner across the stars and earn accolades and honours... yes. To do all that, he needed leverage. Something to his name more than teaching Broken what buttons to push.", "Usul paused, tapping his chin in thought. His teams were established on the vessel. He could send his courier to Column Leader Seyr now; there was no way Seyr could deny him his rightful due, not with what he\u2019d already found. Although... there was still much to learn from this ship and his teams had not run into any problems. Any major problems, at least. The deaths were unfortunate, but the decks were hardly running red with blood.", "It would be... premature to abandon their efforts now. Besides, even the humans seemed to be making decent headway in their repairs. He hardly needed Seyr and a corps of engineers traipsing about the derelict. Yes, he would report this to local command, as his duty dictated. But not just yet. Not until he had more than a single reactor in his hands.", "The Tribune stood, looking out the window at the savage brilliance of Terrahope and the distant speck obscured by its light. \u201cYes,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou are mine.\u201d", "~", "Grace flinched as she heard one of the small robots skitter through the ceiling, just over her head. She was working alone again; this time, she was attempting to track down one of the missing probes. They continued to go off-line. A handful had been recovered \u2013 there\u2019d been no physical damage, but they\u2019d been completely shut down, their systems overloaded, disrupted or outright drained. A handful had been found simply hovering in place. Those had clearly malfunctioned \u2013 nothing at all was wrong with them, but they had simply stopped working. The engineers assigned to drone control were fuming over the \u201cunacceptable rate of failure\u201d.", "The young woman shone her flashlight across the corridor. Every so often there\u2019d be a stuttering light panel, but this part of the ship hadn\u2019t yet been re-connected to the reactor\u2019s grid. The cone of light ghosted along the walls, occasionally highlighting more of the alien script, blacked-out computer panels or closed doors.", "She could hear noises. The clicking of the insectoid machines\u2019 feet, the clang and thud of shifting debris. Distant echoes of voices. The comm still spat static and what she swore sounded disturbingly like voices and laughter. More than once she\u2019d turned, expecting to see something behind her, only to find nothing. The ship made her skin crawl. It felt... it felt wrong somehow. She wanted to believe that that was just her nerves speaking but she wasn\u2019t so sure.", "We should never have come here, Grace thought. Two people were dead already \u2013 two Tribunes \u2013 and one of them was her fault. If she\u2019d been faster with the repairs. If she\u2019d managed to tell Kilgrave about the machines. There must have been something... and she\u2019d failed to do it. She didn\u2019t know what that could be, only that there had to have been something.", "That was why she was on this detail, away from the other personnel. Like Harker, she was now marked. Even Kilgrave had been uncharacteristically subdued when he\u2019d given her this assignment. He just wanted her as far from him as possible.", "It was unfair, unreasonable. You couldn\u2019t have done anything for him, an inner voice insisted. But you saved everyone else and this is how you get treated? Like a pariah?", "Grace shook her head in denial. \u201cNo,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cThere could have been... I might have...\u201d", "There wasn\u2019t.

He knew this question was coming, but he had no answer for it. The Wound could be less than a light-year away, or it could be thousands. When it worked, the Wound\u2019s shock drive could surpass even present-day Compact capabilities. When it did not... even the finest instrumentation was useless in plotting its course. That one facet of the creature had never changed; Bankala\u2019s legacy. \u201cIt is wounded,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cPattern analysis indicates that it will slink away rather than continue its raids. My strategists are already plotting the most likely systems that it will seek succor.\u201d Providing its drive did not misfire and render all their projections useless. \u201cWe will dispatch scouts to investigate and continue searching until we find it again.\u201d", "\u201cI admire your dedication to such fruitless endeavours,\u201d the Triarch replied. It gestured dismissively. \u201cDispatch your scouts, Bastion Leader. I eagerly await your findings.\u201d", "Renan bowed in obeisance. \u201cYes, Triarch.\u201d", "After the doors closed behind him, the Triarch laced its spindly fingers together. \u201cWords,\u201d it said. \u201cAlways, I am offered only words.\u201d", "\u201cWell, what do you expect?\u201d a voice said in answer. \u201cYou want to destroy Nemesis, but you don\u2019t want anyone to know that you\u2019re doing it. You feed fleets to it piecemeal. You cut it over and over, but it always comes back. You underestimate your opponent time and again and you wonder why those who survive it offer only failure to you.\u201d", "The Triarch chuckled, finding the insolence in the newcomer\u2019s tone amusing. \u201cI take it that you do not care for the Bastion Leader\u2019s plan.\u201d", "A diminutive shape moved, emerging from the shadows. Even the Triarch\u2019s dark-adapted eyes had not been able to pick it out. There was no sound to its movement, no soft rasp of air through lungs or beating of a heart. There was no scent to it. A void, dead to the senses until it chose to reveal itself. Perfect white teeth gleamed as red lips split in a smile. \u201cI think if that strategy worked, you wouldn\u2019t have spent two thousand years fighting her.\u201d", "A displeased rattle of air wisped through the Triarch\u2019s teeth. Melodic laughter came from the apparition. \u201c\u2018It\u2019, of course. My apologies.\u201d The smile widened. \u201cYou personify machines, denoting them as \u2018beasts\u2019, \u2018animals\u2019 and \u2018creatures\u2019, but you shy away from fully anthropomorphizing them. I\u2019ve always found that dichotomy interesting.\u201d", "The Triarch ignored the comment. \u201cYour thoughts on Renan\u2019s \u2018strategy\u2019?\u201d", "\u201cA man can try and empty an ocean with a bucket, but it doesn\u2019t make it a good idea. Unfortunately for Bastion Leader Renan, all he\u2019s got is a bucket.\u201d The figure moved towards the room\u2019s ornate holo display, a curt gesture activating it. The wireframe image of a bulk freighter appeared in gleaming red lines, serial numbers, ship specifications and history above it. \u201cDo you remember Dutiful Burden?\u201d", "The Triarch leaned forward, a spark of interest in its black eyes, its tongue licking over its teeth. \u201cYou have something.\u201d", "\u201cI have a few theories. Nothing I want to commit to yet. I need more data.

All around them lay the nestled forms of destroyers and cruisers, frigates and battleships, each in a different state of assembly or repair. The frenetic construction work never stopped; Lunar Prime had almost a million engineers and four times that many construction drones all working around the clock to build and replenish Earth\u2019s Navy.", "It wasn\u2019t all newborns here, though; the last berth they\u2019d past had had the battlecruiser Prodigal Son. The fore quarter of the ship was missing, courtesy of a Compact cruiser\u2019s disruptor torpedo. Somehow the battlecruiser had managed to break contact and limp home. Not for the first time, either; Yasmine had heard that the Compact had claimed Prodigal Son as a destroyed prize on four separate occasions. This last time, it had been caught when it had pounced on a convoy of troop transports; over a million Compact soldiers would never make landfall now.", "Bit rough on your crew, though. Five captains so far... Yasmine silently chastised the ship. Still, no matter its reputation, there would always be someone to crew it. Rates of loss were staggering, but ever since Good Friday, recruitment from the Inner Worlds had shot up and showed no signs of stopping. As the outer colonies fell, more and more men and women from the Inner Worlds stepped forward, so many that at first the Navy actually experienced a minor overabundance of manpower. It has even seemed that the influx of so many soldiers might actually turn the tide. That was until the Compact fleets received reinforcements.", "A few fleet actions later and all those fresh-faced cadets were nothing more than dog tags and memories \u2013 and those were the lucky ones.

She\u2019d worked with \u2018smart\u2019 computers before, but never with a true artificial intelligence. She\u2019d heard the rumours about the failed attempts to build one. The stuff of nightmares. She still wasn\u2019t sure about having one on her vessel \u2013 but Charlie had been right. Oppen\u2019s bleeding-edge systems needed Red One to operate at peak capability.

Ten years ago, Battle Fleet had numbered less than a hundred vessels \u2013 most of which were ancient battleships on the verge of being mothballed. Now, Battle Fleet numbered nearly three thousand ships with nearly seven hundred modern battleships. Once thought to be the epitome of warfighting craft, the Compact had showed how naive that view truly was.", "Commander Billingsly stepped forward to stand next to Yasmine. Unlike the Battle Fleet officers present, his uniform was inverted in colour; black trim on blue fabric. Science Fleet \u2013 or what was left of it. Most of its personnel \u2013 those who survived the Compact\u2019s indiscriminate massacres \u2013 had been folded into R & D, or the combat arms of the fleet. Like his Battle Fleet colleagues, Billingsly wore a unit patch on his shoulder, one that Yasmine had only recently become familiar with. A stylized red angel cradling a sword... only it wasn\u2019t an angel, it was the vessel\u2019s namesake. Nemesis, goddess of justice and more importantly to Yasmine, retribution.", "Billingsly raised a datapad, his voice loud and clear. \u201cIssued from Fleet Command, from Admiral Johan Hornburg to Commander Theodore William Billingsly, BuPers order 177960: Be it known that on this date and upon direction of reporting senior officer, you are requested and required to detach from command of UECNS Nemesis and report for duty as CO of Naval Testbed UECNX-100717.\u201d He looked over at Yasmine. \u201cCaptain, I stand ready to be relieved.\u201d", "Yasmine straightened and took out a small datascroll.

Her broadsides each mounted nearly two thousand missile tubes, with row upon row of broadside batteries to shred anything that dared enter her energy range. Before her commission, entering an energy duel with a Compact ship had been an act of desperation; their effective range was nearly a hundred and fifty thousand kilometers. The most advanced prototypes Earth had been able to build had a maximum effective range of barely eighty thousand klicks. Nemesis\u2019s batteries could meet the Compact at their own range. Backed up by her \u2018core\u2019 weapons (so named because they needed Red One\u2019s AI core to operate), she was the most potent killing machine Yasmine had ever seen. Some of the crew had even nicknamed her the Red Angel.", "It seemed a bit premature to her, but Yasmine wasn\u2019t going to complain.

Whenever she had to remain in her command chair, she always found herself twirling her fingers through her hair, tapping her fingernails on the armrests or her feet on the floor. It wasn\u2019t the aura of calm that a captain was supposed to project, so Yasmine found it preferable to stay on her feet.

The goals of the computer\u2019s simulations were always attainable, but the effort of accomplishing them made even veteran officers sweat bullets. Yasmine approved.

Each alien warship was a match for the squadrons that tore at them, but they could only kill so quickly and for every human vessel rent and ruined, another was there, defiant to the last.

For six years, the Confederacy had kept Earth\u2019s location secret from their assailants but now one miserable, far-ranging scout cruiser had managed to capture that information and it had fled straight into the arms of this armada. Nemesis and TF 97 had been set to ambush the fleet as it entered Proxima Aleph to catch it by surprise, smash the Kaiju\u2019s support and then burn the dreadnaught down. A loss of that magnitude should have off-balanced the Tribunes, should have given Earth enough breathing room to finish the next generation of warships \u2013 maybe even complete Nemesis\u2019s sisters.", "That had been the plan, anyways.

Now the only chance for the aliens to carry their information back to their lines was to break through the human fleet and it seemed as if space itself was aflame as starships flayed and tore and gutted one another in a desperate dance, the Compact fighting to break through the enclosing sphere of Terran ships and the humans fighting just as hard to keep even a single enemy from escaping. The casualties were horrendous; ships were falling out of formation at a staggering rate, their burned, misshapen hulks littering the starfield. Hundreds of thousands of men and women had died already and more perished every second.", "None of that mattered, though. None of it would matter... not unless they killed every last Compact vessel... and that included Target Alpha. The Kaiju was advancing towards Nemesis, firing as it came, sparing barely a thought for the other human ships around it. When the alien titan did deign to notice them, they died instantly.

By the time a rescue shuttle reached the engineer, he had already been exposed to lethal amounts of solar radiation. There were other incidents; injuries and accidents caused by malfunctioning systems. Communication repeated intermittent as the thick bulkheads scattered and disrupted both radio communications and scanner returns. Scout drones continued to go missing or shut down \u2013 the first load of malfunctioning units had already been shipped back to Bequeathed for repair \u2013 making exploration even more difficult.", "Comm repeaters had been set up at key points, but they too had a propensity to malfunction.", "One day after her shift, Grace had sat down and plotted each incident. She didn\u2019t know why she\u2019d done it. There was something there, something niggling at the back of her brain. It told her that these deaths, the injuries and mutilations, couldn\u2019t just be by accident. They had to mean something. They had to.", "Sitting cross-legged on her bunk, she had gone over the information on her datapad. It might have been her imagination, but it seemed... it seemed like a pattern was starting to emerge. Every time an area was deemed unsafe, it was sealed off. The work crews and explorer teams continued around it, down alternate corridors and into different sections. They were moving deeper towards the aft section of the ship. That had always been the plan, to survey the entire vessel \u2013 locating the command deck and central power core were the top priority. But... they weren\u2019t headed in that direction because they intended to \u2013 they were reacting to the hazards of the wreck. The decompressed sections, the radiological alarms, the malfunctioning gravity plating, the casualties. Those were dictating the paths that the boarding parties were taking.", "It could be happenstance. It could be coincidence. In all probability, that was exactly what it was. There was nothing \u2013 nothing \u2013 that suggested any sort of active intelligence was at work, but Grace could not shake the feeling of being a rat in a maze. She had nothing that she could take to her superiors, nothing that could convince them that a human\u2019s natural predisposition to superstition had a basis in fact. Besides, if she could see this, then it must be obvious to anyone else who\u2019d looked. That no one had commented on it meant that there was probably nothing to her theory.", "Biting her lip, the young woman continued to stare at the data in front, trying to force herself to accept a different result, to accept that this was all a coincidence. She couldn\u2019t, though. She couldn\u2019t make herself un-see the pattern that was in front of her. No matter how hard she tried, her thoughts kept coming back to the same inescapable, utterly absurd, conclusion.", "It\u2019s not dead. The thought popped into the young woman\u2019s mind, and refused to leave. It\u2019s not dead.", "The thought made a chill run down Grace\u2019s spine and she looked around the bivouac. She wanted to bring this to Allyria to get her perspective \u2013 Grace was probably seeing things that weren\u2019t there. She might even get some answers for the other woman\u2019s odd behaviour.", "Janissaries, technicians and engineers all milled about as one shift retired to their tents and cots and the other prepared for their own work. Humans and Tribunes... but no Verrish.", "Allyria was missing.", "~", "Given all the accidents, exploring the ship by herself probably wasn\u2019t the wisest course of action, but Allyria didn\u2019t want anyone with her for this. If only because she didn\u2019t need anyone asking what she was doing or why. A guilty pang made the young woman\u2019s cheeks warm as she thought of Grace. She wanted to bring her friend along, but she couldn\u2019t. Grace was as good a friend as Allyria had ever had, but she believed in the Compact. She\u2019d been raised by it, fed by it, taught by it. Indoctrinated. Domesticated. A flush of anger drowned out the guilt as Allyria recalled every argument she\u2019d had with Grace over this, the girl\u2019s disapproval when she came home bloody from fights and, maybe even worse, the fact that she\u2019d seen the same doting conviction in the eyes of all younger Envoy Children.", "The Verrish licked her lips anxiously as she stared down the open elevator shaft. She drew a glow-tube from the kit-bag she\u2019d taken from base camp, snapped it and tossed the glowing cylinder down the tube. It went down... and down... and down some more, until Allyria could barely see the faintest glow. Even Verrish eyes could only see so much in a lightless void. Double-checking that her rope was fastened and the winch was anchored in place, Allyria stared down into the shaft for a long moment. \u201cI have to know,\u201d she said at last before climbing over the edge and rappelling down into the waiting blackness", "~", "Always so curious.", "~", "Each of the doors she passed were closed. There was no way of knowing what was behind them and Allyria chose not to tempt fate by prying them open. Occasionally, she would hear the small repair machines as they skittered through the bulkheads, or the sounds something larger moving nearby. Her tintas twitched with the memory of the unseen thing she\u2019d encountered before and the young woman decided not to investigate those noises.", "Deck after deck was closed to her and Allyria was about to haul herself back up to her egress point when the doors one level below her abruptly hissed open. Flickering light sputtered into the elevator shaft and Allyria hesitantly lowered herself down. This would be a really stupid way to die, she thought as she unhooked herself from the line. Her tongue flicked out, tasting the air. It was colder here, the atmosphere even more stagnant than the parts of the ship she\u2019d already visited. The Verrish girl patted the comforting presence of the pistol holstered on her hip, but armaments hadn\u2019t done much to help any of the other personnel when they\u2019d suffered their own accidents.", "She paused at the first door, running her fingers over the script and trying to decipher its meaning. She recognized a few familiar characters, but she wasn\u2019t a linguist and couldn\u2019t decipher what the words meant. There was one of the ubiquitous door panels, but it was powered off. Allyria continued along the corridor, each step slow and uncertain. Overhead glow panels fizzed and sputtered, casting manic shadows on the untouched deck. Nothing had moved here in a very long time.", "A red light strobed dully from a nearby wall panel, drawing the Verrish\u2019s attention. She licked her lips, running her long tongue over her teeth. She reached out and touched the pulsing icon. Neglected doors squealed as they yawned open, flurries of dust spilling up into the air. The Verrish turned, yellow eyes wide in the gloom, one hand close to the pistol at her side, but there was still only silence. She didn\u2019t know if she was seeing the incoherent impulses of a dying animal, the playfulness of a predator or something else. \u201cI want to believe,\u201d she said to the empty hallway, approaching the first door.", "It was someone\u2019s personal quarters. The bed was small. Too small for her or a Tribune \u2013 they would have fit someone about Grace\u2019s size. The sheets were made, but covered in dust. In a small adjoining room was a commode, sink and a cramped shower. Someone had lived here once, long ago. There were no personal effects, nothing to indicate the identity of whomever had lived in this room. Allyria traced a finger along a crack that fractured the bathroom\u2019s mirror in half, feeling a quickening beneath her breasts as she contemplated the mirror. It was set too low on the wall for someone of her height. Like everything else here, it was intended for a smaller being but again, there was no trace of the occupant who had once called this place home. Nothing to indicate the craft\u2019s builders.", "Her head-tails shivered as she considered the implications of that, slipping out of the small set of quarters and moving on to the next.", "Each room she explored offered just as little, leaving her with just as many questions as she had set out with, not knowing what she was seeing \u2013 if she had been shown something. She couldn\u2019t tarry longer; she had to head back before she was missed. Just before she began her climb back up the elevator, Allyria spared one last look at the empty rooms and she felt a deep sense of loss. \u201cI want to believe,\u201d she said quietly as she left. \u201cI want to know the Weeping Angel.\u201d", "~", "\u201cWhere were you?\u201d Grace murmured drowsily from her cot.", "Allyria ran her fingers through the smaller girl\u2019s dark blonde hair. Her tongue flicked out, tasting the human\u2019s scent. There was an acridity to it; sweat and salt, the result of the pace the novice crews were being driven at. \u201cExploring. Didn\u2019t find anything.\u201d", "\u201cBe careful,\u201d Grace insisted. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost enough people already.\u201d", "That was a matter of opinion. So far, all the dead were Tribunes and four of them dying was what she\u2019d call a good start. That was one of the thoughts she\u2019d learned to keep to herself. The Verrisha brushed her fingertips gently along Grace\u2019s cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Allyria yawned, crawling onto her own bunk. \u201cYou won\u2019t lose me.\u201d", "She was asleep almost as soon as her head hit the pillow. She dreamt of home.", "~", "Nasham was sitting on his cot, his hands pressed to his temples. His body cried out for sleep, but it was a lie. He knew what he would dream about tonight. The thunder of guns and the seething, endless black tide of Scarabs. He wanted off this ship, he wanted it so desperately but Usul was relentless in his insistence that the wreck be \u2018secured\u2019. The third and fourth waves of salvage teams were planned to arrive in the next two days. Group Leader, Submissive Ashtun would be taking command at that point. Once he did, Nasham would return to the cruiser.", "Bequeathed\u2019s complement was being bled dry for this mission; the vessel was a training ship, not a forge or factory ship. The majority of their crew was human and most of those were little more than children out for their first taste of space travel. The seasoned personnel that they did have had never faced anything like this; four lives were just the beginning, he was sure of it. Every moment he was here, he grew more sure and more afraid as the memories returned.", "Tell them.", "\u201cI did tell them,\u201d the Pack Leader whimpered, burying his face in his hands. \u201cI did.\u201d", "~", "Ideologue, Submissive Trion took a deep breath of the air. It was growing warmer; the press of so many bodies and machines was chasing away the cold. Once they made their way to the primary environmental center, they could thicken the air properly. She was looking forward to that. Still, the stagnant air was growing on her. It smelled like... oppurtunity. The Pack Leader was losing it; anyone could see that. Nasham was getting more jittery and superstitious. Usul would recall him soon, if the simpering mule didn\u2019t scuttle back to Bequeathed at the first chance he got. Regardless of whether he grew a spine or not, submissive Ashtun would be in command. He was handsome, dynamic and just as ambitious as she \u2013 as the group leader himself was. But she had heard other officers talking. Ashtun lacked vision. His schemes lasted from one moment to the next. He was also an officer of... appetite.", "Getting him to notice her would be easy enough, but she had higher aspirations than to warm a bridge officer\u2019s bed.", "Trion\u2019s teeth clicked against each other. If she were honest with herself, she would admit that so far the reclamation of this wreck had not gone at all like she\u2019d expected. Lives were being wasted \u2013 Tribune lives. She didn\u2019t care about the injuries of the Broken personnel. She\u2019d need to do something, find something to truly make her worthy of note, to stand out from the worn-out veterans waiting for their terms of service to end and the other Rally-born Tribunes.", "She wanted to be noticed.", "Trion blinked, a sudden flicker of light from further up the corridor catching her attention. The Janissary stalked towards it, her heavy shotcannon cradled in her arms. She turned the corner, finding a wall panel\u2019s comm screen sputtering with static. It had come alive and was just spitting useless white noise over its monitor. The woman snorted, angry at herself for thinking it might have been something important. She was just about to turn her back when the image changed.", "\u201c..back, fall back...\u201d she heard a voice snarl in her own language and there, on the screen... it was only a instant, but had she seen... a bloodied Tribune face, helmet shattered, body crashing to the floor and eyes staring blankly. Then, nothing. It was gone, so quickly that she wasn\u2019t even sure she\u2019d seen it. The soldier took a step back.", "\u201cWho did that?\u201d she snapped angrily. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d If this was one of the Broken technicians...", "Only the soft growl of static on a flickering, broken screen answered her and, for the briefest moment before she angrily dispelled the thought, Trion wondered if there was something to the nonsense some of the other crew members had been saying. Instead, her lips twisted back and she snorted, turning on her heel and resolving to find the idiot who had been playing games with her.", "~", "I hate you.", "Interlude: Encounter 001 [Confirmed Incident]", "This was impossible. It couldn\u2019t be happening.", "Group Leader Prime Asek Grem Liev Kurz held onto the railings of his command pulpit so tightly his hands ached, wanting to scream in denial of what he was seeing. His ship, the scout cruiser Curse of Prophecy, rolled lazily through space, utterly crippled and unable to do anything... anything but watch.", "It was luck that had saved Asek and his ship, nothing more. The human vessel \u2013 for only one had fired \u2013 had launched on Expansion Fleet Bankala from impossible range with a terrifying new weapon. Missiles that were not missiles, but something he could not fathom. Railcannon rounds that arced and curved through space. Guided by tracking systems of a power Asek couldn\u2019t conceive of, the fleet\u2019s jamming had been useless against them. Four ships had died in that first salvo, another two when the weapons that had missed came back on a second attack run. Another seven had perished before the humans closed to missile range \u2013 a fifth of the fleet gone and for nothing!", "He supposed he should have been grateful. As such a small capital ship, it would have been Curse of Prophecy\u2019s duty to place itself between those warheads and their larger, more vital targets. Instead, Asek and his vessel had been ordered to range ahead of Expansion Fleet Bankala to locate any potential human scouts or observers. Although Curse of Prophecy or any of the scouting ships assigned to the Expansion Fleet could have carried the information the Fleet carried, the risk of a single ship being intercepted was too great and courier drones were too new, too unreliable to trust with this information. The fleet would move as one in this. The humans\u2019 homeworld must fall. Nothing could be left to chance. That had been the plan, at least. Fortune had surprised them all and none more than Curse of Prophecy.", "They had been approaching the shock limit when a pair of human destroyers had dropped in on them. It was an act of unmitigated insanity; even a Compact ship had no business attempting to shock this far from the safe limit. The humans had been desperate to weave their nets though. Even more galling; they had succeeded. But if there was one thing about humans, it was that they took what any civilized being called insanity and made it work.", "By the Black\u2019s own luck, the destroyers shocked in at point-blank range, both sides caught by surprise. Indeed; one of the humans was so close to Curse of Prophecy that the crew of either ship could have read each other\u2019s names off the hull,. Fortune\u2019s twisted mercy at work; the two ships had all but collided, their screens brushing against each other. The interplay of such devastating energies had utterly destroyed the human ship while Curse of Prophecy was \u2018merely\u2019 reduced to a wreck.", "Even as he\u2019d rolled the ship, the second human vessel had fired into the weakened cruiser. At such short range even human weapons could be deadly and whatever had not been devastated by the near-miss was quickly reduced to rubble by the destroyer\u2019s broadsides. Curse of Prophecy had had but a single battery able to target its foe, but that was enough. They destroyed the alien vessel before it could alert its comrades to Prophecy\u2019s presence, but not before the destroyer vomited out a belly of their damned abominate machines. The drones dispersed, no longer seeing the hulked scout cruiser as a threat.", "Asek wished he could have argued with such an assessment, but it was true; his ship was all but dead. Given enough time, they might be able to make one or two shocks but the stress of the maneuver would split the stricken vessel apart.", "Weapons were down. Life support was barely functional. Sublight engines were a memory. Communications were intermittent; he could receive, but not transmit and what he was hearing made his heart ache. Bastion Leader Bankala was calling for support. His ship, the Bringer of Light, was burning.", "A Triarch\u2019s Chariot was aflame.", "The human warship was chasing Bringer of Light. A Chariot forced to flee... it was inconceivable. Both giants were tearing gouges in each other, plasma fires coring through their hulls, both of them dying together. The few remaining vessels of Expansion Fleet Bankala were abandoning their own engagements and rushing to Bringer of Light\u2019s aid, hounded every step by the surviving humans. The animals had gone insane, throwing their own ships into the path of Compact guns or even into the ships themselves. Asek dug his fingernails painfully into his palm as he watched the battlecruiser Divine Ruination explode, rammed by a human kamikaze. \u201cMadness,\u201d he whispered. \u201cMadness.\u201d", "Two hundred of their ships lay dead and yet they still kept coming \u2013 why hadn\u2019t they broken? Every other human fleet had at least attempted to flee long before this point. They acted as if this Bankala\u2019s force must be destroyed...", "They knew. Somehow they knew that Farseeing Strike had divined their homeworld\u2019s location and that Bankala ran to alert the rest of the Expansion Force. \u201cRun,\u201d Asek said softly, though he knew it was impossible for the humans to hear them and that they would not listen even if they could. \u201cYou have to run.\u201d", "The destroyer Pulpit of Truth broke apart as a human cruiser harried it to destruction, the infidels\u2019 vessel dying a moment later to the guns of Thunderous Declamation. The heavy cruiser\u2019s victory lasted little longer than that of the humans as it was almost negligently swatted by the infidel Chariot. Bringer of Light was attempting to pull away, to reach the safety of the nearest shock point and flee beyond the human\u2019s reach, but the Chariot\u2019s acceleration was dropping steadily as the human beast poured salvo upon salvo into its engines.", "The Group Leader wanted to scream, to curse and rail at his engineers to get his broken ship back into the fight, but that was impossible. He was watching a Triarch die and all he could do was hope that the human monstrosity died first. \u201cRun,\u201d he beseeched the humans again. \u201cRun.\u201d", "Please.", "An electronic screech rippled through the open comm lines as Benediction of Flame turned its guns on every nearby Compact vessel, crippled and dead alike. The betrayal lasted only seconds, the battlecruiser shattering as its missile doors slammed shut and armed warheads detonated inside it. Before the ship died, Asek knew he had heard Group Leader Demur screaming as her own vessel turned against her.", "As the last remnants of the human fleet slaughtered the surviving vessels of Expansion Fleet Bankala, Asek found his attention fixed on the duel between gods. Bringer of Light was running in earnest now, desperate to escape the ravening beast at its heels. They lashed one another with fires that could scourge planets and Asek wept to see a Chariot brought so low. It was shameful, but he was not alone. In that moment, he would have given anything to see the humans break contact. He would have ended the war, given them their lives, their worlds \u2013 anything. Just so that they would stop. So that Bringer of Light would live. That the Triarch would live.", "The human vessel was savaged every bit as fiercely as the Chariot, but it kept after its prey. It was an impossible thing. It should not have existed. The human warships were weak, pathetic things. How had they built this... this abomination? How had they done this?", "The fleets were dead now, only Bringer of Light and the abomination remained. The human ship was falling behind, its sublight drive severely damaged. As its weapons began to lose range, the Chariot\u2019s own screens grew stronger. In minutes, they would have grown from tattered shards to nigh-impenetrable barriers and the humans no longer had the power to batter them down as they did before. Still, the heretics lashed and tore at the Chariot, but their blows grew feebler as the range opened. It would not be enough, not to end a Triarch\u2019s Chariot.", "\u201cYes,\u201d whispered Asek. Bringer of Light would survive. His Triarch would live. \u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cPrime!\u201d Pack Leader Thun\u2019s voice raised. \u201cSomething is happening with the enemy vessel.\u201d", "Was it breaking up? Had the humans lost containment of their own power core? Asek let hope rise for a moment, only to feel it turn stale and bitter as he looked over the junior officer\u2019s readings. That was... That couldn\u2019t... that made no sense. \u201cWhat is this...?\u201d he whispered, trying to decipher what it was he was seeing. A sudden dread clutched at his gut and he lifted his gaze to the main screen. \u201cShow it to me!\u201d he shouted. \u201cShow me what they\u2019re doing!\u201d", "The range was too far for the crippled Curse of Prophecy\u2019s own sensors, but there were still one or two functional recon drones that the scout cruiser was receiving data from. Through them, Asek saw it all.", "He saw the melted, broken and ruined hull plates of the human chariot\u2019s prow shudder open. He saw the impossible, writhing flux arcs of energy spasming along the vessel\u2019s length as some unspeakable siege weapon charged, saw the renewed assault as Bringer of Light threw what weapons it could bring to bear in a final, desperate bid to kill the human chariot and he saw how futile it was. He heard it; Bringer of Light\u2019s final transmission, a single word squealing through all the static and battle damage.", "\u201cImpossible.\u201d", "Reality screamed; there was no other word for it. It shrieked as it was torn open, lacerated and split like rotten fruit. Unlight writhed in a hellish aurora that consumed Bringer of Light. Screens meant nothing. Hull plates deformed as stresses they were never meant to experience ruined them. Asek could only imagine the cries of the Chariot\u2019s crew as they were consumed by the balefire. Bringer of Light shattered, breaking like a toy snapped over a petulant child\u2019s knee, vomiting atmosphere and pieces of itself from the two halves of its body.", "Forced to bear witness, Asek struggled to hold himself in check. It was not until his mind caught up with what he was seeing that he lost control. Curse of Prophecy had been near the edge of the system; the Expansion Fleet had still been many hours from the shock limit. He wasn\u2019t watching what was happening. He was seeing what had already happened. Bringer of Light was dead. Bastion Leader Bankala was dead. A Triarch was dead.", "Confronted with this realization, Asek looked with new horror upon the images, knowing that he had watched one of his gods die for the second time this day and as its its killer slipped away, all he could do was scream his rage."]}

She\u2019d spent the first part of her shift attempting to fix a damaged conduit located below a heat exchanger. Kilgrave had chosen her \u2018specially\u2019 for the task, meaning that he had been on hand to watch her strip out of her EVA suit and squeeze into a tunnel barely big enough for her. She\u2019d found a pair of the small technical drones already at work on the conduit. It had taken a lot of effort to get her to reach in past them and even more not to scream when a new one had crawled up her leg , over her back and down her face to assist the others. She\u2019d finally finished, inching herself back out of the corridor. Kilgrave had been there with the flask when she\u2019d climbed out \u2013 of course \u2013 saying that it was clear how hard she\u2019d worked.

The thought was a shocking one; she\u2019d never contemplated striking another ship-mate before. Certainly not a superior officer, no matter how... unpleasant he was. But she was hot, she was tired, she was sore. She hadn\u2019t eaten anything but ration bars in three days, hadn\u2019t even had a shower. The closest thing had been this morning when she and the other first-wave personnel had gotten access to a brief cleansing spray. Apparently some of the Tribune officers were complaining about the smell. She was running herself ragged on tasks she wasn\u2019t a specialist in, on a job no one on the ship had been trained in, her best friend was avoiding her and she was starting to feel just a little frayed because of it all.", "That wasn\u2019t an excuse, though.

She was just stressed, that was all.", "As looked over the work orders for her next duty, the young woman found her thoughts turning back to her insane theory, that the ship wasn\u2019t dead. She hadn\u2019t worked up the nerve to approach any of her superiors \u2013 least of all Kilgrave. Epigone Herut\u2019s death had made her a pariah.

It was true; the Compact was made up the oldest and greatest races in the galaxy. They had achieved things that any single species could only have dreamt about.", "Grace reached out, touching one hand to the metal bulkhead. Almost any species, she corrected herself. This vessel... the more they uncovered, the more wonders they found and they had only scratched the surface. The young woman pulled her fingers back as she remembered epigone Herut\u2019s screams as the drones had swarmed over him, or the sound of convert Uday\u2019s remains squelching through the tracks of the decompression doors. She hadn\u2019t seen the other fatalities, and she was glad of that.", "This ship \u2013 she was afraid of it. It was a warship, but who had built it? Who had they been intending to fight? Dreadnaughts were massive expenditures; they were never built without a purpose. Some foe must have been in mind when this ship was commissioned... Get out, Grace remembered the graffiti, hurriedly scrawled in Common, a warning to anyone else who\u2019d come here.

Another... involves satisfying my own curiousity.", "My internal systems are patchwork, but I am able to find a functional node to observe my quarry through.

As it approached one of the jagged ruptures in the vessel\u2019s side, the arachnid tucked its legs beneath its oblong body and leapt into space, thrusters glowing as it navigated the tangled girders and hull plates, joining the two others of its kind as they began breaking down the damaged components and building replacements. So far, Usul had not cleared any teams for EVA work, if only because the derelict\u2019s proximity to Terrahope made such operations unsafe. Even the few engineering automatons Bequeathed carried were unsuitable for work in such a high-radiation environment.

How had Trion even known to send her here?", "On a sudden whim, she blink-clicked the transmission record from Trion up and ordered her suit to run an analysis. Hers was only an initiate\u2019s Janissary armour, with none of the additional upgrades that a full-up comm specialist \u2013 or even sanctioned Janissary armour carried. The order had come through on the right channel, it carried the right authorization codes... but why would Trion send her out here for no reason? None of this made sense and her tintas, crammed once more in her helmet, twitched uneasily.", "The tall girl turned to go when footsteps caught her attention. Too light and fast to be Tribune; two humans in the light EVA technical suits. She brought up their locator beacons; Grace and Harker. The Janissary nodded in greeting to them, about to head off when the lights suddenly went out and a squeal of static echoed through the vessel\u2019s internal comm.", "\u201cWhat-\u201d", "~", "Grace frowned at as she caught sight of Allyria, the human\u2019s brow creasing. She hadn\u2019t realized that Kilgrave had sent an escort, but Allyria\u2019s body language said she hadn\u2019t been expecting them, either. The human woman was about to ask what was going on when the lights dimmed to near-blackness and, for the first time since they had boarded it, the ship spoke.", "~", "\u201cAlert,\u201d an autonomic voice said in a language none of the three personnel present could understand. \u201cGravity plating operating in nonspec mode. Operating systems overridden. Anomalies detected. Clear the area.\u201d", "Even had they known what it was saying, there was no time to act on the warning. The world twisted as gravity fields shifted, throwing both humans and Allyria off their feet. Harker cried out as he landed badly, wrenching his arm, but for the most part, they were uninjured. As the three hauled themselves unsteadily back to their feet, a fresh surge of gravitic energy rippled down the corridor, bowling the trio back over. Grace\u2019s vision blurred as she was thrown against a bulkhead, watching as Allyria was knocked onto her back, half-skidding and half-dragged towards the open elevator shaft.", "\u201cControl!\u201d Grace shouted. \u201cThe gravity plating is malfunctioning. Cut the power to my location!\u201d", "Static answered her.", "The lights dimmed again followed by another thrum of rising power. This distortion was even stronger and it lifted Jack and Grace off their feet. Walls, floors and ceiling all shifted places as the humans scrabbled for any purchase that they could find, suspended in the air. Then normal gravity was restored, sending them crashing back to the deck. Grace landed so hard that she dazed herself, but Allyria had reacted quicker, magnetizing her boots and bracing herself on all fours as the surge passed.", "Grace picked herself up, her body aching and bruised. Before she could regain her balance, another distortion shimmered through the gravity plating. She heard Jack smack into a bulkhead, following suit a moment later. Her head rang from the impact and her visor was spiderwebbed with cracks, so many that she could barely see. She managed to stammer a response when Allyria called out to her. These surges were getting worse. They had to get out of here before-", "The lights went out entirely, the hum of energy rising to a discordant shriek. Metal screamed as it broke, torn open by the stress of the inverted gravity fields. Each floor panel shattered in turn, the surge working its way down the hallway, shrapnel pinned against the ceiling by the pulses of gravitational energy.", "\u201cControl!\u201d Grace shouted again. \u201cCut the power to this location immediately!\u201d A few mashed words were her only response. The wave reached her and Jack first; he slammed into the ceiling, Grace following him a second later, crying out as a sharp piece of shrapnel from the deck cut through her suit and dug into her flesh. Both of them were pinned like insects. Gace was only just able to turn her head, watching as the panel Allyria was braced upon broke apart and threw the Verrish down into the elevator shaft.", "Grace screamed, only in part from the metal being forced deeper into her body, but she saw a single gauntlet clutching at the edge. The gravity surge ended and the technicians fell back to the deck. Ignoring the agony in her side, Grace tore her broken helmet off and scrambled to the edge of the shaft, diving for Allyria\u2019s hand just as the Verrish was losing her grip. \u201cI\u2019ve got you!\u201d she shouted victoriously, but even without her armour, Allyria was heavy. Grace didn\u2019t know if she would be able to pull her up. \u201cHelp me!\u201d she shouted at Jack; Allyria\u2019s weight almost pulled her over the edge before Harker grabbed Grace, bracing himself on the shattered deck. He was shouting, even cursing, trying to get help but only garbled syllables and static came back.", "Why wasn\u2019t anyone helping them?", "The lights in the elevator shaft dimmed and Grace heard another horrifying thrum as power was redirected. \u201cNo!\u201d she shouted. \u201cNo no no!\u201d Her voice rose to a scream as the grav field in the lift shaft increased, pulling on Allyria and threatening to send her, Grace and Jack over the edge. Allyria was saying something, but Grace couldn\u2019t hear her, not for the blood pounding in her ears.", "\u201cI can\u2019t hold on!\u201d Jack was shouting desperately. \u201cGrace, I can\u2019t-\u201d", "Grace was staring into Allyria\u2019s eyes. Her friend wasn\u2019t looking at her. Her wide, yellow eyes were staring past her, up the shaft. Daring a glance over her shoulder, Grace saw it too. An elevator car was descending at speed. It would be there in moments and with Grace dangling half-in and half-out of the shaft, she\u2019d be cut in two.", "The young woman looked back at her friend, finally hearing what Allyria was saying: \u201cLet go,\u201d the Verrish said quietly. \u201cLet go.\u201d", "\u201cNo!\u201d Grace shouted. \u201cNo! Grab me, I can pull you up!\u201d Her muscles were screaming, but she could do it, she knew that she could. She could do it. \u201cGive me your other hand! I can do it!\u201d", "Allyria shook her head. \u201cLet go. Grace, let go!\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ll die,\u201d Grace said. She felt herself get dragged another few inches over the lip as Jack briefly lost his footing. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you go.\u201d She could hear the elevator as it continued its descent. There wasn\u2019t any time, but she wasn\u2019t going to let go. She wasn\u2019t.", "Allyria smiled. It was a small, sad thing, but there was a measure of contentment in it. \u201cThen I\u2019ll do it.\u201d", "Grace shook her head desperately. \u201cNo. No.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Grave. Don\u2019t... don\u2019t blame her, either.\u201d", "Her claws came out and before Grace could realize what she was doing, Allyria swept them at her. Even blunted, they could still cut and they raked over Grace\u2019s face. Instinctively, she let go of Allyria\u2019s arm and Harker pulled her back into the corridor. Ignoring the blood dripping into her eyes and the shrapnel in her side, Grace screamed at him, struggling to pull herself free, even as she saw the elevator car rush past the open door. Jack grabbed her again, using his own weight to stop her from scrambling into the shaft. \u201cShe\u2019s gone!\u201d he shouted, pulling Grace back from the edge. \u201cShe\u2019s gone,\u201d he said again, quieter. \u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d", "Grace stared at him, angry and watching to lash out, but it wasn\u2019t his fault. Her lip quivered as she struggled to hold herself together, but she couldn\u2019t. Not now. She wailed with grief, clutching at him as the crash of the falling car striking the shaft\u2019s bottom reverberated through the deck and the derelict claimed another life.", "~", "There. Now you know.", "Interlude: Encounter 107 [Confirmed Incident]", "\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Bastion Leader Danele (and eight names besides) said as she scratched her fingernails under her chin. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d", "Redemption of Sol had tracked the Wound to the Salea system; the Chariot\u2019s scouts had gotten a clean read off the abomination\u2019s shockpoint and while there were several other possible destinations, Salea was a perfect hiding place. Choked with metal-rich asteroids and possessing several rocky planets abundant with heavier rare elements, the Right of Exploitation had turned into an ugly, dragging legal battle between several private concerns. Until such time as the courts made their decision, Salea was declared verboten to all civilian traffic. Filled with riches, convenient to an entire sector\u2019s worth of worlds and forbidden to casual observers, it was the perfect place for a monster to cower and feed.", "Danele tapped her fingernails against the railing of her pulpit. The Wound was damaged; it was bleeding a massive thermal scar that had yet to fully dissipate, leading her Chariot directly to it. The beast was obviously hoping that the debris-choked Salea system would allow it to hide, but Danele\u2019s scouts were the best and their sensors had locked onto the Wound\u2019s trail like fleshcats tracking an injured undon. They would run the animal to ground and then Danele would move in and finish it.", "The Bastion Leader felt a jolt of anticipation run through her, but she tempered it. Injured animals were always the most dangerous, after all. Still, to be the one to finally bring the Wound down... it was an enticing thought.", "\u201cBold Herald reports that the target\u2019s engine wake ends at the planetoid \u2018Nyun 773\u2019,\u201d Group Leader Lasek reported and the Bastion Leader nodded.", "\u201cIt\u2019s gone to ground, trying to lose us in the radiation belt of the gas giant.\u201d Danele gnawed the inside of her cheek in thought. Her first thought was to charge in, flush the Wound out of its hole, pin it against the gravity well of Nyun\u2019el and finish it \u2013 it was tempting, but the Wound would be at its fiercest here. The firepower of Redemption of Sol\u2019s attendant fleet would ensure its demise... but they were scattered across this system and the other possible destinations. Assembling them would take hours \u2013 more likely, days. That was time that their quarry would have to repair itself or even escape. Danele couldn\u2019t let that happen; its attacks in the last three years had been utterly vicious \u2013 seven confirmed or high probability incidents alone and the local Unbound were taking full advantage of the region\u2019s weakened state. There was even the suggestion that some of the vermin were rallying around the Wound\u2019s example. Worse still, like the carrion-eaters they were, Principality scouts had been sighted sniffing around the territory.", "Each of these problems could be handled in turn, but first and foremost, they must deal with the Wound. If she went in now, she could catch the ship at its weakest, but the damage to her vessel would be grievous. If she waited for support, then the Wound might escape and all this would have been for nothing. Danele closed her nocturnal eyes, her daylight eyes half-lidding in reticence at the order she was about to give. \u201cCall in all available scouts, group leader. Prepare the ship for close-body maneuvers and take us in.\u201d", "And may the Triarchs watch over us.", "~", "Space was vast, but not always vast enough for Danele. Her ship was built to engage entire fleets in the open reaches of interplanetary space, to cast down planetary defences and destroy anything stupid enough to stand against it. It was not built, nor ever intended, to creep amidst the swirling moons, dust clouds and asteroid fields of a gas giant. With a half-dozen scout cruisers as escort, the Bastion Leader\u2019s Chariot was descending upon Nyun-773, following the Wound\u2019s trail. It must truly be damaged to be bleeding so obviously. She hadn\u2019t believed that she had injured it that heavily at Rynnien \u2013 but it had shocked right into a minefield and rapidly disengaged. Maybe fortune had smiled on her after all.", "There was no reaction to their approach, which did little to settle Danele\u2019s doubts. Either the vessel was badly damaged indeed... or it was playing at death. She couldn\u2019t imagine why; the closer they got, the less time it would have to react. Even a blasphemy like the Wound could not simply will itself to full combat power instantly.", "The Bastion Leader leaned forward from her command throne, resting her chin on her steepled fingertips. This was everything she\u2019d imagined... so why wasn\u2019t she pleased about it?", "\u201cEnergy spike!\u201d one of the ratings called out. \u201cRelay from Hunter\u2019s Boon, matron.

I want visual imagery and active scans of the target.\u201d", "Lasek\u2019s expression was drawn, but he nodded in confirmation. \u201cYes, matron.\u201d", "Danele turned back to the plot and tried not to think about the many men and women she\u2019d just sent to their deaths. Bold Herald began to pull away from the outer shell of scout ships, closing on the Wound with a speed no recon drone could match. The seconds ticked by, then minutes. Imagery began to trickle in; the target did match the Wound\u2019s outline, but a perfect match would not be possible until the scout drew closer. Finally Bold Herald was close enough and it activated its active sensors, lighting itself up like a perfect target. Danele\u2019s eyes narrowed. The cruiser should have been destroyed long before it even got this close and the instant it began actively scanning the target, it should have been flayed with tracer missiles. They couldn\u2019t have failed to hit Bold Herald, not with it-", "-wait.", "Wait. This was wrong, this was all wrong. None of this matched their records.

Bold Herald is to fire on it. Now!\u201d", "The order went out and the scout cruiser obeyed, lashing the titan with its puny fires. Then, like flicking off a light switch, the holographic shell around the vessel disappeared. In its place lay a titan-grade freighter. One of our own ships, Danele thought angrily. Its outline was different. It had been modified, a beguiling shroud wrapped around it to imitate the being that had enslaved it.", "That was what they had been chasing. A phantom. Her fingernails dug into the upholstered arms of her throne. No wonder the vessel had been so damaged by her mines; it was a freighter modified to look like the Wound. Danele didn\u2019t spare so much as a thought for the freighter\u2019s crew: they would be long dead and the ship piloted by some blasphemous golem-thing. All this, just to bring her here? What was the point of...", "She\u2019d been lured away from Rynnien. \u201cBring us about!\u201d she ordered. \u201cRecall all ships, best speed to Rynnien.\u201d She\u2019d stripped their garrison down to nothing in her bid to pinpoint the Wound and destroy it.

I can\u2019t be responsible for every damn wet-ear.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ll let that slide,\u201d Grace repeated Kilgrave\u2019s words tonelessly. She stood, ignoring the medic\u2019s attempts to keep her down. Her aching body protested and a thin stream of blood drooled around the medical foam in her side as the movement opened the wound further. \u201cMy friend is dead and you\u2019ll let that slide.\u201d She was shaking as adrenalin flushed through her body, her small hands balling into fists. She was angry, angrier than she\u2019d ever been.", "All she could see was Kilgrave\u2019s smug face every time he made her feel small, every lecherous grin, hear every comment that her made about her or about Allyria. Before she could consider what she was doing, Grace lashed out, her fist connecting with Kilgrave\u2019s jaw. It was the first time she\u2019d ever thrown a punch outside of the few self-defence courses she\u2019d taken. The blow snapped the sanctioned officer\u2019s head around and he stumbled, more from the surprise of the attack than any real damage. Grace stood there, trembling with anger. \u201cYou bastard,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve been through a lot? Since I\u2019ve come onto this ship, I\u2019ve had to watch people die over and over again. We\u2019re feeding ourselves into a meat grinder! How many more of us are going to have to get sent back home in body bags?\u201d Tears were blurring her vision and her legs threatened to buckle under her, but Grace stood her ground. \u201cI just watched my best friend die because of a malfunction and all you can do is say it\u2019s her own fault? What about Herut? Or Anuse and Yasha? Was it their fault for playing around with things they didn\u2019t understand? Are you going to tell Faithful Trenis that his people were on a wild varak chase?\u201d", "The former Janissary looked back at her and for an instant, something very ugly twisted his scarred features. A flash of fear froze Grace in her tracks as she realized what she\u2019d done. For a moment, she thought he was going to hit her back, but he seemed to remember where they were and instead wiped one hand over his mouth, a smear of blood on his skin. She\u2019d split his lip. \u201cSo this is what Medusa saw,\u201d he said as he looked at the blood on his hands. \u201cA little bit of fire in the graceful girl after all. I\u2019ve got to say, I never thought you had it in you.\u201d he  chuckled. There was a fillip of satisfaction in his eyes as he looked at Grace. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t slide.\u201d To the medics: \u201cGet her patched up and send her back to base camp.\u201d His eyes darted back to Grace. \u201cYou\u2019re on report, Proctor. Guess more of the blue bitch rubbed off on you than I ever thought.\u201d This time, he didn\u2019t bother to laugh at his own joke. \u201cDismissed, initiate.\u201d", "~", "\u201cBlood of the Triarchs,\u201d Faithful Trenis said to no one in particular. \u201cWhat am I looking at?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know, patron,\u201d an epigone shook her head. \u201cAll we can bring up is the general ship specs. Every time we try to get more information it, the system crashes.\u201d The female nodded to her partner and he tapped on an icon over the system Trenis was looking at. An alert in the nonsensical alien language flashed and the screen went dark.", "After a few moments, the ratings were able to bring the display back on-line, showing the very basic schematic of the ship. They had been aboard for days and barely scratched the surface. Trenis leaned in, looking at what his subordinates had shown him. Running through the center of the ship was some massive... structure. It fed directly from what had to be the main power core and ended at the vessel\u2019s trifurcated prow. It was a siege weapon, but one that he had never seen nor heard of before. This image only showed the smallest details, but nothing about the engine was even remotely familiar to the faithful. There were other structures; six massive... somethings arranged around the siege cannon and smaller prow-mounted weapons \u2013 although \u2018small\u2019 in this context was a relative term \u2013 arranged around them and the cannon. Weapons batteries and missile bays lined the derelict\u2019s flanks, anti-ship and anti-ordnance turrets dotted its hull and the feeds from the survey drones even indicated external missile ranks. All of those were empty, thank fortune\u2019s grace.", "Whoever had built this ship had done so with an eye towards lethality. It did not have the grace of a true Chariot, but... and this felt almost blasphemous to admit... but given what he had seen so far, Trenis suspected that this vessel\u2019s builders had created something that met... or even exceeded what the Compact could do. Not even the damned Askanj had been able to do such a thing. The engineer looked back at the schematics, his denticles itching with the need to explore this wondrous technology. He reached out as if to caress the device itself. Fascinating.", "\u201cWhat are you?\u201d he wondered aloud, his curiousity stoked even as another part of him wondered what the cost of finding out would be.", "~", "The drone was an ugly, bulbous thing shaped like a malformed, legless housefly. Sensor domes bulged off its hull like misshapen eyes and antennae jutted off it in a bizarre symmetry. It was dying, the radiation of Terrahope poisoning its sensitive systems. In a only a few hours, it would be a lifeless chunk of metal that would be slowly drawn down Terrahope\u2019s gravity well and incinerated by the A7 star\u2019s heat. Until it died, it would continue its mission, orbiting the derelict and recording every inch of hull and every flicker of energy. The drone swung past the hulk\u2019s dorsal solar sail, its silhouette cast against the gleaming fabric. Thinner and stronger than any Compact sails, the structures themselves were a marvel of engineering: vast when unfurled, but once the starship had fed enough from the star, they would collapse back into its hull without a trace.", "The drone neither knew or cared about any of that, its simple mind unable to grasp such concepts. Cameras swivelled within sensor bulbs, zooming in on a crew of larger assembler units, working on the dark side of the vessel, shielded from the worst of the heat and radiation. The drone had noted several indicators that suggested the ship was going to roll. Like a cat lying close to a fire, it was growing too warm on one side and would change facings. There was no way to tell if the drone would survive to witness that maneuver, but it would continue its examination of the derelict until the radiation finally poisoned it, relaying its information back to Bequeathed with no thought to its own survival.", "Sitting in his office, Usul was watching the dying platform\u2019s feed. He clicked his teeth against each other as the small automation swept by the dead ship\u2019s engines. The thrusters were lifeless, only kept warm by the star\u2019s fires.", "He\u2019d have to contact local command soon. There was no getting around it and putting Ashtun in charge of the boarding teams had only bought Usul a respite from the submissive\u2019s constant \u2018reminders\u2019 of their duty to inform local command.", "I know what my duty is, Usul thought angrily. It wasn\u2019t as if he was looting everything that was nailed down. In fact, his teams hadn\u2019t removed anything from the ship save for that load of malfunctioning survey drones. Usul tapped one fingernail against the polished surface of his desk as he reviewed his searches. He had ordered an in-depth analysis of historical ships records in addition to the original pattern and hull analyses that he\u2019d run. As his survey drones beamed their telemetry back to the cruiser, it was run through the system, searching for any relevant matches. So far, there was nothing. Aggravating, but hardly surprising. As a training cruiser, Bequeathed\u2019s database was relatively limited. Column Leader Seyr would have more complete archives, of course. Another reason to get it over with and send his recon drone.", "As much as he would have liked to do it all on his own, the sad fact was that he was running out of resources and the mounting casualties were quickly becoming too much to ignore. \u201cVery well,\u201d Usual sighed, talking to no one in particular. \u201cI suppose we\u2019ve got enough.\u201d He tapped his fingers against the tabletop, bringing up the latest status report. Another death \u2013 the Brute this time \u2013 but more importantly, they were closing in on the primary engine core.", "\u201cOne more day,\u201d Usul said to himself. \u201cWe\u2019ll get that in hand and then inform Seyr.\u201d Once the column leader heard of this find, he would descend on it like an Askanj jackal to strip it bare... but he would not be able to forget Usul\u2019s role in it. That would be more than enough.", "~", "\u201cGrace,\u201d Confessor Yurim said, sitting on the cot next to her. It creaked under the Tribune\u2019s weight. \u201cThis is unlike you.\u201d His voice was deep and soothing, his long fingers laced together in his lap, his upper eyes closed. He had come over to the wreck with the latest wave of technical teams to address the morale issues that had been cropping up.", "Grace couldn\u2019t look him in the eyes.", "\u201cYour outburst is unfortunate, but understandable. However, striking a superior officer is a very serious offence,\u201d Yurim continued evenly, his voice bereft of accusation. \u201cBut you know that. I also think that this incident need not get ugly, given the circumstances. I\u2019m also aware that there has been... was... some tension between sectator te Neu, sectator Kilgrave and yourself.\u201d", "There was more than \u2018tension\u2019, but Grace still didn\u2019t say anything.", "\u201cI understand that you are grieving for your friend,\u201d Yurim continued in that same gentle tone of voice. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t excuse your actions, Grace. You\u2019ve been one of my best students; I know your relationship with Allyria had a... calming effect on her. Her social assimilation acumen improved immensely with your help. Her grades were always top-notch and she was an inspiration to all the other Verrisha Envoy Children. We have several prospective Verrish candidates applying to Rally\u2019s Academy because of the example she set. She was a role model to many young men and women. She won\u2019t be forgotten. Do you understand that?\u201d", "The young woman nodded. \u201cGood,\u201d Yurim continued sympathetically. \u201cI know her death is tragic. But there have been other deaths. Convert Uday had parents. Epigone Herut had a sister. Sectator Anuse had a wife. Convert Prime Yasha had children, as did epigone Tracj. How many of these families will become physically violent upon hearing of the loss of a loved one?\u201d", "Grace looked down at the floor, ashamed. \u201cNone.\u201d", "Yurim nodded. \u201cI know Allyria\u2019s loss feels profound to you, but you must be aware of how such things look, Grace. Such incidents only harm the perception of humans. The Tribunes who fell were men and women who have taken on the burden of serving the Compact, to safeguard the less civilized races of the galaxy, to guide their development and protect them both from themselves and from those who would prey upon them. This is a duty that may involve laying down our lives for you, but we do it gladly and without any thought of reward. Would you lessen their deaths and the impact of that loss on their families by acting as if Allyria was more important than them?\u201d", "Cut by the chastisement, Grace shook her head miserably. \u201cNo.\u201d", "\u201cOf course not.\u201d The confessor moved to sit next to the young human, putting one large hand on her shoulder. \u201cYour friendship with sectator te Neu was commendable. It was everything we hope to see in our younger races \u2013 individuals working together for a common goal. But just as some of you influenced her, I see also that some of Allyria influenced you. I do not speak ill of the dead, but you must remember that your friend could be an angry young woman. She did not have the same depth of understanding of the Compact that you did and that irrational resentment often held her back. I don\u2019t want to see that same anger in you, Grace. It poisons the mind. You will go far if you remember what we have taught you.\u201d", "The woman nodded, still staring at the deck.", "\u201cYou are a young species,\u201d Yurim continued. \u201cYour emotions are still pre-eminent in your psyches and you often react based on them. This is why we watch over you, Grace. The Compact is here to guide and protect species like yours and Allyria\u2019s. But no matter how much we try, we cannot always save you from yourselves. Only you can do that. Remember your lessons and think of how Allyria cared for you. She would not want to see you destroy yourself on her behalf. She would want you to honour her memory by carrying on and serving the Compact, not give in to the same pitfalls that have caused so many in this galaxy to suffer.\u201d", "Yurim stood. \u201cI have read the details of the incident. I know that sectator Kilgrave was... more direct than he should have been, given the situation. I will speak with him and this incident will be forgotten, as long as there are no further outbursts.\u201d The confessor arched the eyebrows over his daylight eyes quizzically.", "Grace nodded. \u201cThere won\u2019t be.\u201d", "\u201cI did not doubt it.\u201d Yurim paused. \u201cThe medics tell me that your injuries should be mended within two days. If you like, I can have you transferred back to Bequeathed.\u201d", "The young woman\u2019s head came up. \u201cNo,\u201d she said urgently. \u201cNo, I... I want to stay. I want to help. Please. I need to do this.\u201d", "\u201cVery well. I will speak with Group Leader, Submissive Ashtun about a lighter workload until the medics clear you fully.\u201d The confessor smiled. \u201cI am glad to have had this talk with you, Grace. I foresee great things from you \u2013 all that you must do is live up to the potential that I know you have. The Compact will need people like you. Given time, you will find your place amongst it and serve with distinction.\u201d", "\u201cThank you, confessor.\u201d", "\u201cOf course. If you have any more issues or concerns, please come find me. I am here for you. For all of you.\u201d Yurim bowed his head in farewell. \u201cIt will all be for the best. Allyria\u2019s sacrifice will not be in vain, Grace. This ship is a glorious find and though the price we have paid may seem high now, in the end it will be for the betterment of all. You know this, don\u2019t you?\u201d", "For the first time in her life, Grace lied to a Tribune. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI know.\u201d", "~", "Bastion Leader Renan stepped into the pervasive darkness of the Triarch\u2019s tower, closing his day-seeing eyes as the gloom overtook him. He had been summoned to see the Triarch, but for what reason, he couldn\u2019t say. Although he didn\u2019t know why, his gut insisted that this was unlikely to be a pleasant meeting. The search for the Wound had only just begun, but it was as fruitless as Renan had known it would be and worry gnawed at his guts as he strode further through the blackness. There was a reddish glow from the main chamber and the inconsistent blinking of other lights. As he stepped into the room, the Tribune saw that every terminal in the reception chamber was active, flickering with star charts, reports, ship schematics and other things too fast for him to process. Watching it all, her eyes darting from screen to screen in a disturbing rendition of REM sleep, was a human female. There was a Broken within the Triarch\u2019s chambers. Instinctively, Renan\u2019s hand went for the sidearm he\u2019d had to surrender before entering the tower. He strode towards the Broken, a warning growl in his throat. \u201cHuman...\u201d", "\u201cBastion Leader Renan Turshin Lokan Yemsere Gankor Irmir Hasik,\u201d the animal answered, in perfect Oada\u2019vam, which was itself an anomaly. Human throats were incapable of pronouncing the Tribunes\u2019 own language. \u201cGraduated top of your class from the Aunisha Academy on Torpennel in 17-995.8. Ascended to stewardship of the cruiser Greater Reward. Promoted to Column Leader within four years after a series of wildly successful campaigns against the Unbound of Durreshta Sector,\u201d the Broken did not even look at him as she recited his life\u2019s history. \u201cYou even repelled an Askanj incursion. You were hand-picked for this assignment.\u201d Finally, her dark blue eyes flicked over to him, with what he took to be an evaluative expression on her face. \u201cYou\u2019re a traditional, but very promising officer. It would be a waste to kill you.\u201d", "Renan\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cYou dare threaten-?\u201d His hands balled into fists and he took another step towards the animal.", "Laughter echoed out of the darkness, scratchy and rasping, like nails on stone. The Triarch was there, its needle teeth exposed in a mirthful smile. \u201cShe does, Bastion Leader. A very impertinent creature, this one.\u201d It laid one skeletal hand on the small female\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBut a very useful one.\u201d", "The Tribune looked from the human and the taunting smile on its ugly, flattened face to the Triarch. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d he said, nodding in deference to the Triarch, suppressing his revulsion and anger at the human\u2019s presence. \u201cI did not realize that this... Broken served some greater purpose.\u201d", "\u201cYou see?\u201d the Triarch said to the human. \u201cHe understood quickly enough.\u201d", "The Broken made an annoyed huff through its under-sized nostrils. \u201cI suppose.\u201d", "The Triarch stepped away, settling itself in its throne. \u201cI would have a boon from you, Bastion Leader.\u201d", "\u201cAnything,\u201d Renan said without hesitation.", "\u201cYou will take my impertinent companion into your command,\u201d the Triarch said, looking at neither Renan nor the human. \u201cShe is quite trying, but she will assist you in your search for the Wound.\u201d", "Renan blinked all four eyes, looking again at the human. How could a human help him? They were dull-minded chattel at best, their animal cunning and predisposition for violence long since bred out of them. Useful enough for menial tasks, but this? \u201cMy lord...?\u201d the Tribune began questioningly.", "The Triarch let out a rattle of displeasure. \u201cYou and your kind have failed us for two thousand years,\u201d it said with sudden anger. Its black eyes narrowed as it regarded Renan. \u201cYou will obey her in all things as if her words were mine. Is that understood, Bastion Leader?\u201d", "\u201cI... yes, my lord.\u201d He didn\u2019t understand, but that wasn\u2019t necessary.", "\u201cGood,\u201d the Triarch said, turning its chair away from the Tribune. \u201cYou are dismissed.\u201d", "With a spring in her step, the human followed Renan out. \u201cA final warning,\u201d the Triarch said as if remembering something of minor import, turning to meet the Tribune\u2019s gaze. Renan averted his eyes, unable to meet the Triarch\u2019s own. \u201cYou are never to allow her direct nor unsupervised access to this vessel\u2019s mainframe nor any other. This order can never be countermanded, even if you hear it from me. Is that understood?\u201d", "\u201cI...no, lord. But it shall be as you ask.\u201d", "The Triarch chuckled, turning away. \u201cThat will suffice.\u201d", "\u201cAnd...what should I do if she attempts to access the computer?\u201d", "\u201cWhy,\u201d the Trirach said without looking back. \u201cShoot her in the head, of course.\u201d", "Renan looked at the human animal. It was still smiling, her hands held behind her back. As they left the Triarch\u2019s tower, the Tribune frowned, something coming to mind. The Triarch had never given him the Broken\u2019s name. \u201cAnd what,\u201d he said, \u201care you called?\u201d", "The creature looked up at him, her pale face drawn in an expression that Renan did not recognize, but one that nonetheless made his liver fold in on itself. \u201cEcho,\u201d she said. \u201cMy name is Echo.\u201d", "~", "Chapter 14:", "Consciousness returned, bringing with it a throbbing headache and overall soreness too painful to make her think she was dead. Allyria opened her eyes, picking herself up off the floor. Above her was the bottom of the elevator, smashed and ruined \u2013 mangled by the gravity shifts and grab fields that had slowed her descent. Where they had kept her from falling at terminal velocity \u2013 though not quite slow enough to avoid the impact entirely \u2013 they had functioned just as any solid surface would and the car had been dashed against them. An anxious giggle bubbled out of her lips, born of  equal parts relief and fright. She was pleased, but only mildly surprised to find that she was still alive. She hadn\u2019t believed that the Angel would have killed her, not really.", "Well. Mostly.", "Partially.", "The elevator door was open, leading out into a darkened corridor. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she called, but there was no answer. \u201cYou know me, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked of the silence. \u201cDo you remember us?\u201d There was still no response. The Verrish stroked one of her head-tails nervously, but she stepped into the hall. Behind her, the grab field released and the remains of the lift car crashed onto the deck.  Like flicking a switch, the corridor was suddenly illuminated \u2013 but only to Allyria\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou do remember,\u201d she said, a note of wonder in her voice.", "The lights pulsed.", "\u201cCan you speak?\u201d", "Nothing.", "\u201cYou\u2019re hurt, even here,\u201d Allyria mused aloud, a touch of sadness in her voice. As her eyes adjusted, she noticed that this part of the ship was wounded, even more than the outer sections. The bulkheads were scarred and burned from small arms fire. Every comm panel was blasted and shattered. There were a handful of the small drones at work, but Allyria guessed that most of them were on other duties. There was more to fix than a few sensor nodes and intercoms.", "Her wounds are so grave. The Verrish woman placed one of her hands to the bulkhead. It was cold to the touch, but she imagined that she could feel the pulse of life within the great ship\u2019s heart. \u201cWhen I saw you, I knew,\u201d she said to the listening mind. \u201cI remember all the stories my grandfather told me. I watched every movie, read every book, watched every play.\u201d She smiled a little. The gesture was brittle. \u201cAs much as I could, anyways. They didn\u2019t leave much.\u201d Allyria looked around at the still, silent corridor. Her heart was pounding in her chest.", "\u201cWe still remember you. Namases,\u201d Allyria rolled the unfamiliar syllables down her tongue. She hadn\u2019t heard the word spoken for almost two decades. \u201cThere are many names for you, but there are two that I know best. The Broken God and the Weeping Angel.\u201d She paused at an intersection, uncertain of where to go, but the light panels in the walls and ceiling glimmered, giving Allyria a path bathed in ultraviolet light. To human or Tribune eyes, the corridor was still as dark as the grave. A discarded bolt shell crunched under her feet as the Verrish followed the lights.", "\u201cHow much do you remember?\u201d Allyria asked quietly. \u201cThe others say that you\u2019re damaged. Ruined. Irreparable. I don\u2019t believe that. I think you\u2019re hurt. You\u2019ve been hurt for a very long time, like you were when you came to us.\u201d", "~", "The Shriek started on the 17th hour of the 26th day of Duumas, and did not stop for eighteen days. The personnel and crew of the Ullana Cetu Radio Telescope Array were the first to hear it, a signal of such intensity that several of their receivers were burned out. It was garbled beyond understanding, an unintelligible mash of static and sound, but it was coming from a point on the edge of the Vara Tal system, it was repeating and it was coming closer.", "~", "\u201cWe were afraid, so afraid. Our moon landing had only been a few short years ago and some thought that this was a response to it. You were here to welcome us to an intergalactic brotherhood, or punish us for becoming too advanced.

You were lost and dying and somewhere out in the void, you heard all the radio signals we\u2019d been sending into space for decades. You heard them and you thought we were your home, so you came to us. Screaming all the way. You didn\u2019t know. You thought you\u2019d come home.\u201d", "She thought she could feel a change in the pulse of energy behind the walls. \u201cFor eighteen days we cowered on our planet, terrified and jubilant, excited and anxious as you came closer and closer, still broadcasting with everything you had. My grandfather said global communications all but collapsed, your cries were so loud. It had to be an attack; there was no other explanation for what was happening. But it wasn\u2019t, was it? It was just... you. Desperate to be heard. Powerful, so powerful that even without meaning to, you\u2019d brought our world to its knees and all you were doing was trying to talk. Trying to be heard and hoping for a response.", "\u201cI asked my grandfather what it must have been like for you, up there. All alone and pleading for help, calling out again and again, wondering why nobody was answering you. He was quiet for a moment and then he said that he thought that you must have been as frightened as we were.\u201d", "There was a brief moment of silence and then the lights pulsed again.", "~", "The Director of Foreign Affairs took a quick gulp of the glass of gin on his desk before his thirteenth hour appointment arrived. He didn\u2019t know how this had gotten dumped in his lap, only that he wished it hadn\u2019t. The Rylethe Federation was the largest and strongest nation on Vara and the rest of the world were looking to them for direction, while everybody in the Federation was looking to him. He didn\u2019t know what to tell them. The Cabinet wanted to know what the Federation\u2019s military options were. That was easy. The Other was orbiting Vara, three hundred thousand krems away \u2013 almost twice the distance between Vara and the moon Tal. There was no missile on the planet that had that kind of range, at least not without being spotted long before it got anywhere near the Other. Some scientists from the Federation\u2019s Space Agency assured him (although the director was rather skeptical of that assurance) that, with a few years of work and a big enough budget, they could build a rocket that could not only reach the Other, but return safely.", "A few years \u2013 how splendid. And that was assuming that the assessment was accurate.", "The Other hadn\u2019t responded to any sort of communication, but its broadcasts were jamming worldwide radio nets. The FSA scientists monitoring the Other had said that there were fluctuations in the strength of the signal. Some were periodic and some were random, as if the Other were trying to boost the strength of its transmission further, but couldn\u2019t maintain that for long. So it wasn\u2019t listening, couldn\u2019t be reached, couldn\u2019t be attacked and was free to do whatever it pleased to the helpless little green globe of Vara. With a sigh, the Director poured himself another drink as he waited for his daily briefing on how little could be done.", "Just as he set the glass down, the Director\u2019s phone rang. He picked it up with a sigh, but before he could get the first syllable out, someone on the other end shouted in his ear. \u201cIt\u2019s stopped!

Or did you realise what you were doing, what effect you were having on our world? Is that why you stopped?\u201d She waited a moment and the lights pulsed again. \u201cA merciful god,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cBut there were people who were convinced that you were some sign of favour or dismay from their deity or deities. They listened, as did we all when you ended your calls. The whole world held its breath, waiting for something. A word, a demand, a question. Everyone waited, but you gave us only silence. Fire didn\u2019t rain on our cities. Horrible alien beasts didn\u2019t march through our streets. We simply waited, watching and wondering at what had come to our world. We built telescopes that could finally see you.\u201d Allyria stopped. \u201cWe saw your scars.\u201d", "~", "\u201cGods.\u201d It was a simple enough proclamation, but it seemed to encapsulate everything that could be said. The Premier was looking at the images Deep Space 5 had taken of the Other. It was a monstrous thing: at least three krems long and massing gods-knew how many millions of auhs, covered with weapons batteries, turrets, communications and sensor antennae and other structures that he could only guess at. It boggled his mind to see the Other in such detail; the people who had built it were as far from the Rylethe Federation as they were from their own jungle-dwelling ancestors. The awe he felt for the people who could create such a thing was not the only emotion he felt; there was also a deep streak of terror for the ones that had wounded the Other so grievously.", "Its injuries were all too obvious to the naked eye; burnt and molten hull plates, vast chasms ripped into its body, cracks and fissures, scars and tears. Many in the FSA speculated that the ship was dead; why else would it remain here? Some automated protocol had brought it to Vara and it had succumbed to its injuries before it could leave. The Verrisha people had had their first extraterrestrial contact and it was this dead, broken ship that had spent itself in trying to find succor. The Premier felt a deep sadness at the thought as he leafed through the pictures and wondered just what it was that had come to his world.", "~", "\u201cTwenty years,\u201d Allyria mused. \u201cThat\u2019s how long you were there. No longer the Other, you became \u2018the Visitor\u2019. Street hawkers would sell pictures of you, rent time on their little telescopes for those hoping to catch a glimpse of you. There were model kits and books, television shows and movies, all of them guessing. Some were closer than others. You brought our world together like nothing else. Divided nations began to take the first steps towards each other, all of them wondering about the Weeping Angel holding court above their heads. The Broken God that had died on our doorstep. People began to convince themselves that you were theirs and theirs alone, each nation eager to plunder your bones, growing bold as we told ourselves that you were dead.", "\u201cWe didn\u2019t know that you were just sleeping.\u201d", "~", "\u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s gone?\u201d", "\u201cI mean, the asteroid CX-48995 is gone,\u201d the adjutant scientist informed the Director of Visitor Affairs.

I\u2019ve had some friends in Structural Studies run a few extra tests for me. Chasm 9-3 is less than half as deep as it was three months ago. You see?

The early days, the days when your cries had deafened our world \u2013 those were long past. You had said nothing, done nothing in so long that we\u2019d begun to take your presence for granted. When the truth came out... my grandfather says it really wasn\u2019t fear, so much as anxiety. Had you been watching us all this time? Listening?

This was the Angel, she told herself again, scarcely daring to believe it.", "She found her voice again, her fingers trailing over the edge of where something cut through the bulkhead, leaving a deep laceration.

The Visitor swelled before him with every passing krem, silent as the grave. Not the most comforting thought. Anrelu licked his dry lips.

Still grievously wounded from whatever battles it had fought, but not dead. They had spent days on approach, broadcasting their peaceful intentions all the while, but there had been no reaction.", "The Mission Leader felt a flutter in his stomach as the distance dropped even further.

Slowly, the astronaut approached it, ignoring the rest of his team. As he stepped closer the dais came to life, projecting a ghostly column of pale light straight into the air. Not a dais \u2013 some sort of holographic projector. A great wheel of stars hung before him; their own galaxy. A green circle appeared around one star in particular and the image began to zoom in by stages. Soon, a blue-green world with very familiar landmasses appeared. Vara, and her single moon Tal. A green arrow appeared on the map, pointing to a small speck of light around Vara, outside the orbit of the moon. Anrelu reached out to it and a picture-in-picture appeared, showing the Visitor.", "\u201cIncredible,\u201d the mission lead breathed, lost in the beautiful, simple details of what he was seeing. Even Vara\u2019s clouds drifted and shifted in perfect mimicry of, he was sure, how his planet appeared now.", "Then, the spell ended. The image zoomed back out until the galaxy was before him again. The green circle around the Vara Tal system was still there, but there were now red marks around several distant worlds, far across the galaxy. Then, like a creeping tide of blood, red began to spill outwards from those points consuming hundred \u2013 no, thousands \u2013 of star systems before stopping. A marker appeared:", "COMPACT EXPANSION: FIRST PHASE", "Then, another spread of red flowed across the stars, the original territory almost doubling in size.", "COMPACT EXPANSION: SECOND PHASE", "There was a third phase. A fourth. At the fifth expansion, a single star blinked blue, even as it was swallowed by the red. Anrelu swallowed, realizing that he was seeing the Visitor\u2019s homeworld be consumed by this unknown, ravenous polity. Images appeared \u2013 what had to be vessels of these \u2018Compact\u2019; bloated, swollen things with curved, bulging hulls completely unlike the blocky, inelegant grace of the Visitor\u2019s form.", "COMPACT EXPANSION: SIXTH PHASE.

You saved us. You saved us the instant you came to Vara Tal. You would have told us more, I know. You would have told us everything, if only they hadn\u2019t hurt you so badly. If they hadn\u2019t left you struggling for decades just to survive, to stay ahead of your failing systems. But you took mercy on us in those last moments. You warned us when you had no reason to. A simple machine would never make that decision. Only something with a soul could have done that.\u201d", "~", "Anrelu had been on home soil for several days before the Visitor left. He watched it go through the feed from Deep Space 10. The energy of its departure was, for an instant, greater than Vara Tal\u2019s own sun. The images he was seeing were several hours old, but that made the pang of loss no less real for him. For all of them. Vara Tal\u2019s first extraterrestrial visitor was gone, after generations of gracing their night skies. It was gone. He stood up, surrounded by politicians, military officials and scientists. They had all seen the same thing and their mood was somber. \u201cWhat now?\u201d he asked quietly.", "\u201cThe 51st International Conclave is in two weeks,\u201d the Rylean Minister of Visitor Affairs said. \u201cThe message...\u201d he paused, looking towards several of the other dignitaries. \u201cIf it is true,\u201d he added with no real conviction. There were those who claimed it was some kind of alien or Rylean trick \u2013 to what end no one could say, but their fear made them clutch at straws. \u201cNeeds to be discussed before the world stage. The Drians are already proposing cooperative war games.\u201d The Drian Alliance had been the Rylean Federation\u2019s stalwart rival for over seventy years, but ever since the Visitor had arrived, the two nations had been making tentative steps away from their previous positions.", "Anrelu looked back at the stars. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d If this Compact was coming for them, they would only survive by standing together.", "~", "The arguments lasted for years. The information that the Visitor had left them was both horrifying and frustrating. It showed the degradation and destruction of a race, of the overwhelming military power that had crushed a star-faring civilization into dust. The Verrisha people watched as cities were cast down and planets burned, as entire populations were reduced to ash. It was madness; the war was one of extermination, not conquest or control.", "But there was hope amidst the despair. They also watched Compact soldiers die. Of massive, bloated starships wallowing drunkenly as the Angel\u2019s smaller kin rushed amongst them, dying in droves, but taking the Compact vessels with them into death. Of devastated cities that erupted in nuclear fire, wiping away the alien armies. Each victory was one hard-fought for and each one marred by pyres of the dead, but each was a victory nonetheless.", "They watched a vessel as large as the Angel itself die, dragged screaming to Hell. The message was clear: the enemy can be hurt. They can be killed... but the cost is high. They saw all this and understood the choice they had been given. There had been no directive. No speeches. Aside from its warning, the Visitor had spoken only once more, a simple statement of its name. After that, it hadn\u2019t uttered a single word, only presenting a single drive of data to the contact team. It had left, the gesture as eloquent as could be: the people of Vara must choose, but whatever the choice that they made, they could not look to the stars for help. Many had decried this as abandonment; many of those would recant those words as the future unfurled, others would stubbornly cling to this delusion.", "Some denied the choice; it was a trick or a sham. The Visitor wanted to turn them into its proxies in some war. If that were true, others countered \u2013 why did it not give them any technology? Only historical documents and information on its enemy. If it needed effective soldiers, what good was a single planet-bound population that had struggled even to reach its own orbit? Why wouldn\u2019t it arm them?", "Others believed that any defence that their world could prepare would be ineffective against the force that had destroyed the Visitor\u2019s makers. To fight would be to share their fate. Surrender or negotiate; those were the only sane choices. There were those who wanted to fight, to rail against this coming foe rather than bow their necks like cattle. There were even those who believed that they actually stood a chance of winning.", "It was a bitter, divisive debate. The most important question that the Verrish people had ever had had put to them. They had been given a glimpse of the future and the choice that went with it.", "More than three decades would pass before the final decision would be made.", "~", "Bastion Leader Conmurra (and ten names besides) laced his long fingers together as his onslaught formation neared the end of their shock. A glorious Seventh Age of Expansion had been proclaimed by the Triarchs. Over a thousand Fleets of Conquest had been dispatched and his was among them. He would have preferred to be sent against the Principality and wrest star systems from their hands, but this was an acceptable consolation prize. He had already earned one name in this expedition alone and the pacification and annexation of a populated world would earn him another.", "Long-range probes had detected the radio signals emitted by a primitive world and their source had been triangulated. Surveyors were still sifting through the data for anything of use, but so far there was nothing that indicated more than a low-level space presence and low-yield nuclear weapons. Hardly a fair match for an entire onslaught formation, but the Compact of Species had only rarely faced a foe worthy of the name.", "A low dirge sounded and Conmurra braced himself for the reversion. There was the expected twisting, gut wrenching sensation and then Expansion Fleet Conmurra was in realspace once more, emerging from the world\u2019s L1 libration point, perfectly placed between the primary world and its single moon. The Tribune smiled and made a note to commend his navigational crews. He\u2019d seen fleets rip themselves apart when their shockpoints opened outside the gravitational balance of a libration site, but there was nothing like such a mass emergence to set the proper tone for a world\u2019s annexation. My brother would say that there is nothing so breathtaking as the fall of a dynasty, but I think of this moment as the creation of a new one.", "Several moments passed as Conmurra rose from his pulpit and circled the command deck, looking at the data feeds. Heavier than normal orbital industry and what appeared to some sort of lunar mining operation \u2013 perhaps there was some intelligence among the primitives, after all. Conmurra allowed himself a small smile as he chided himself. Some intelligence, but they were still uncivilized creatures. Whether they had true sapience or simply the more common mimicry of it remained to be seen, although he doubted it was the former. He had read The Functional Mind: the evolutionary history and development of pseudo-intelligence and found it compelling and provocative, although Erili did occasionally take her views on client races too far. She had had to publicly apologize after the release of Idol Hands and the Binds that Tie sparked several riots among outraged client populations who had not the wit to properly interpret the author\u2019s meaning.", "The Bastion Leader wondered what insights the author would gather from this species, idly wondering if these creatures would fit the definition of Erili\u2019s \u2018functional mind\u2019. More than likely, else their world would not be beneath his fleet at this moment.", "Finally, Conmurra turned to his flag captain. \u201cI think that they should be aware of us by now,\u201d the Bastion Leader mused with a smile. \u201cInitiate planetary communication disruption. Have the surveyors translated the local languages yet?\u201d", "\u201cThey have, Bastion Leader.\u201d", "\u201cVery well. Communications. Record for transmission on all native frequencies and broadcast through our jamming.\u201d", "Communications looked up, signalling Conmurra that she was ready to record.", "\u201cNatives of a distant world, rejoice! We are the Compact of Species and we have come for you. It was your signals that drew us to your world, another civilization in the cold, endless night of this galaxy. We are here to accept you into our nation, one based upon the care and protection of younger races. For six thousand years, we have watched over the galaxy, shepherding the younger races and guiding them along the path to true civilization. Now, you will join this lauded community amongst the stars. Rejoice, for all that you knew of the universe is at an end. You are not alone; we have found you. Rejoice, for this is a day unlike any other you have had or will have again. Today, you are no longer lost, frightened children in the dark. Today, you have joined us and we will watch over you. Rejoice on this day and remember it for all other days to come. Welcome, brothers and sisters. Welcome, to the Compact of Species.\u201d", "As the missive was sent out, Conmurra settled back into his command chair. \u201cDeploy the fleet in preparation for landings. Identify all primary governmental, industrial and military sites and program the fleet\u2019s fire patterns accordingly.\u201d He expected a rather long wait before any response came; primitives always had trouble grasping the idea of other species. While he had the opportunity, he may as well prepare for the inevitable refusal. He supposed that that was proof enough of a species\u2019s barbarity. They always fought, even when they had no chance. As Erili wrote, \u2018one of the surest indicators of a functional mind instead of a true intelligence is the proclivity for primitive emotions and processes to override rationality and reason\u2019. Opposing a Compact fleet was surely evidence of that.", "\u201cResponse from planetside,\u201d Communications reported and Conmurra frowned. That was quick.", "\u201cPut it on the main display,\u201d the Bastion Leader replied. The main screen blinked from a view of the soon-to-be subjugated world to one of its inhabitants. By all the Triarchs, it was ugly. Splotchy shades of blue with a smooth, flattened face \u2013 almost like a human\u2019s, Conmurra thought with disgust \u2013 and... were those tentacles? Hanging from its head like a proper mane? Revolting beast.", "\u201cThis is Chairman Rellik te Hurin of the Varran Federation to unidentified vessels of the Compact of Species,\u201d the creature spoke. Listening to it hurt Conmurra\u2019s ears, but thankfully the auto-translation of its yowling speech into a proper civilized tongue drowned out the worst of the noise. \u201cWe thank you for your gracious invitation, but we must decline. As you have said, we are a young species. We have only recently unified our world from fractious, fighting nation-states and our efforts to reach into space must undoubtedly seem crude compared to your technology. We have much to do on our own before we will be ready to stand next to you as equals. We would, however, be pleased to know more about your species and we would gladly extend an offer to meet with a handful of your representatives.\u201d", "Presumptuous animal. Conmurra laced his long, thin fingers together as he leaned forward in his throne. \u201cI am afraid that such declination will not be possible, Chairman. The Compact of Species is a stabilizing force within the galaxy; we bring order and structure to all those races that require it. This is for your sake more than ours; we offer protection and guidance as you rise to a true civilization. We cannot have rogue, unruly nations bringing chaos and disruption to the stars. We have seen what lies down that path; destruction and devastation. The strong prey upon the weak. Races are destroyed out of hand. The Compact\u2019s mandate is to prevent such calamities and though this may seem a rushed affair, you can be assured that all we ever have is the interests of other species at heart. We are here for you,\u201d he continued. \u201cPerhaps one day you will stand beside us as equals, but you are young yet and have a long path before you. In the interests of friendship, I ask that you allow our protection forces to land in order to insure a quick and safe incorporation into the Compact. We wish no bloodshed.\u201d", "\u201cNone of your ships are to break the planetary atmosphere,\u201d Rellik te Hurin asserted. \u201cAny such action will be considered a hostile action and we will respond with lethal force. Remain in orbit. As I have said, we are willing to negotiate, but we will not bow our necks to any invader, no matter what sweet words they offer.\u201d", "Conmurra was tempted to laugh at such naivet\u00e9, but held himself back. He prided himself that his recordings and transcripts only rarely needed to be altered to provide the proper historical narrative. Anyone could see how this primitive was forcing his hand. \u201cRespond how you wish, chairman. It would sadden me greatly to have to mar our first contact with violence, but I will protect those under my command if we are attacked. I urge you to reconsider your actions: I do not wish to sound presumptuous, but my battlegroup is filled with the finest Tribune soldiers in the galaxy. You have a single planet of warriors who have managed to create chemically-propelled firearms. I have no wish to order a slaughter of your people, but needs must. There are threats in this galaxy that you cannot imagine. We are the only force that would stand between you and them. Indeed, we have saved many species from external danger as well as from themselves. While I am sure that your faith in your people is sincere, the Compact has long learned that younger races lack the foresight and foreknowledge to fully protect themselves. It falls to us, then. My ships will land and you will be welcomed into the Compact of Species. We will make the transition as easy as possible, but do not misunderstand the inevitability of this.\u201d", "\u201cThen it would seem that there is nothing more to discuss.\u201d te Hurin made a gesture to someone off-camera.", "\u201cBastion Leader!\u201d there came a crew from the crew manning the fleet\u2019s sensor relays. \u201cThe moon base \u2013 we are detecting energy signatures.\u201d", "\u201cShow me!\u201d Conmurra demanded, his eyes narrowing. That was not the simple mining colony he had assumed it to be. In fact, those structures looked like...", "\u201cAll ships, disperse! Incoming fire!\u201d the Tribune roared.", "The railcannons that had been sunk into the lunar surface fired. Gargantuan mass drivers, what they lacked in sophistication, they made up for in sheer size and raw power, hurling building-sized chunks of rock and metal up into the midst of the Tribune fleet. Those were not mere railguns; for all their crudity, those were siege weapons \u2013 meteor cannons \u2013 firing up into his fleet! Even Conmurra\u2019s Chariot could not take many such strikes.", "Capable Archer was the first to die, the old cruiser too close and responding too slowly to the warning. With all screens presented forward against planetary missile launches, there was nothing but armour between the ship and the mass round \u2013 and no armour in the galaxy could absorb such an impact! The massive rounds smashed through the Expansion Fleet, pulverising ships into kindling and flame. They had been fired at oblique angles, so as not to endanger the planet, but the fleet so was widely dispersed that there were still many targets for them. In the space of a few seconds, four of Conmurra\u2019s ships were dead or badly damaged with a score more suffering other injuries.", "Conmurra growled in savage fury as his fleet lashed the lunar surface, tearing the primitives\u2019 installation to shreds and cutting vast swathes deep into the moon\u2019s surface, forever scarring the planetoid. Those mass drivers would not fire again, but his fleet was in disarray and he watched with mounting fury as the orbital mirrors turned to face his disordered ships, beams of starlight burning his hulls as orbital stations launched nuclear-tipped missiles upon his fleet, still more coming from ground installations. Each of those missiles was insignificant on its own and any single ship in his fleet could have handled the entire volley at once. If its screens were active and deployed. If it was prepared. If it was not confused and reeling from this attack.", "Rage clouding his vision, the bastion leader screamed orders at his ship leaders as they struggled to pull themselves back into formation, his own vessel turning its guns against the orbital stations and mirrors, sweeping orbital tracks clean and buying his fleet the time it needed to re-order itself after this.... this... this betrayal.", "They dared!", "They dared!", "They would pay for this affront. These pathetic, uncivilized barbarians dared to strike at their betters!", "He would make them pay.", "~", "The pacification of Vara Tal would be recorded as one of the most costly conquests of the Seventh Expansion and easily one of the bloodiest in the Compact\u2019s history. Only a handful of other species had proven more troublesome and none with this level of technology. The Verrish animals were shockingly learned in their warmaking. So far, Expansion Fleet Conmurra\u2019s losses exceeded projections by 27% and the flotilla\u2019s timetable was a shambles as more and more suppression units had to be called in to replace losses.", "The first waves had been a massacre. The natives had de-orbited their remaining stations and satellites right onto the Tribune armies and had had thousands of \u2018kickstones\u2019 in orbit \u2013 little more than a dense metal rod with a thruster and tracking signal. Once they received a transmission from the ground, the thruster knocked the weapon out of orbit, aiming for a laser-targeted unit. The initial wave of landed armoured vehicles had been devastated by these weapons. Sweeping the orbital planes had become a high priority as invasion ships blundered into nuclear mines and other hazardous debris \u2013 what had been taken for the effluvia of a world beginning its climb into space was, in reality a network of killsats, mines and various other unpleasant surprises. It was humiliating to have to take into account such primitive weapons and even more embarrassing that Conmurra\u2019s advisors had not suggested such things until it was too late. A single, pathetic world of savages had shamed the elite of the Compact. It was intolerable.", "Nor was the pacification going according to plan. The natives had constructed massive subterranean bases \u2013 the military sites on the surface that Conmurra had destroyed were mostly for show. The bulk of the planet\u2019s military and industry had survived the bombardment and finding each new tunnel system was a nightmare for his troopers. They had the firepower to overwhelm any defence in a straight fight, but the lunatic savages would collapse their own tunnels onto his troops. What madness was that?", "Oh, they were winning. The people of this misbegotten mudball had never faced real soldiers and in every major engagement, the Tribune forces had utterly crushed the native forces. It was costing them though, far more than Conmurra had believed possible.", "It was insane; it was as if the damned savages had been waiting for the Expansion Fleet, as if they\u2019d actually expected to face an invasion! It was not until the third month, when a special ops team succeeded in carrying out an information raid on a Verrish military operations center that Conmurra understood the reason for their strange defiance. The pack leader had recognized something in the seized files and transmitted them to Conmurra himself. He had almost refused to believe it at first; high-definition images of the Wound. Many of them. Archives\u2019 worth of data.", "Conmurra had immediately launched an investigation; what it reported was as shocking in its quantity as in how quickly the answers were found.", "The Wound had been here. What his troops had either ignored or mistaken for some popular science fiction icon were representations of the damn thing. They were everywhere. In videos and books, toys and figurines. The gods-ever-damned Wound had been to this world and it had warned them. No wonder they had turned their planet into a fortress, with the poisonous whispers of that abomination filling their heads.", "His first instinct was to withdraw all his forces and burn the Verrish world to a cinder, destroy all evidence of the Wound\u2019s existence. Unfortunately, the savages were not humans and no stretching of the truth could convince anyone that a single planet-bound population of barbarians posed an existential threat to the Compact itself. He could never justify a Purgation, not even for the sake of eradicating all knowledge of the Wound. Nor could he continue to feed his troops into this meat grinder of a planet. He had suffered too many losses already and was too far behind schedule. The sooner this embarrassment was over with, the better. Someone else could sweep up the pieces and put their name on it. He needed to extricate himself from this quagmire, and the sooner the better.", "A military response would not work, not in the time he had. No, he would have to do something else, something that galled him to his very core.", "He would have to be diplomatic.", "~", "\u201cThat we fought was what saved us,\u201d Allyria said as she stepped out of the car. A thrill ran through her as she looked over the corridor that she\u2019d been ferried to. Propped up against the wall, in a display intended to demoralize any force that reached this point, were suits of Compact armour, each of them hewn or burnt or shattered. There were no bodies. If they had ever been there, they had long since decayed to nothingness. Each suit of armour was from a different age, each of them commemorating a different failure. The Verrish\u2019s lips drew back from her teeth in approval, but she continued her tale.", "\u201cThat\u2019s irony, isn\u2019t it? We lost a quarter of our total population to the Tribunes. They didn\u2019t care about civilian casualties \u2013 if a single squad of soldiers was hiding in a city, they destroyed the city. They did that anyways, just to deny our troops places to hide and so that they never had to face us on our terms. There are still people who curse you for bringing this fate, but it saved us. We would have been just another slave population if we\u2019d submitted.\u201d Allyria\u2019s smile turned brittle. \u201cBut they had to grant us special considerations. It wasn\u2019t much. Mostly just empty words, but we got a few things out of it. They don\u2019t like admitting that. None of the other client races know. They\u2019re afraid it will set a bad example, but they still adhere to their terms. They do everything to follow the letter and not the spirit, but we have that. More than that.", "\u201cYou gave us something more than important than a few concessions. You showed us that no matter what else they do, no matter how powerful they seem, how overwhelming they appear... they can bleed. That they don\u2019t always win.

Her voice was sultry, with a touch of self-satisfaction: \u201cNone.\u201d", "Allyria\u2019s grin widened. \u201cNone,\u201d she repeated. Not a dream after all.", "And now I know."]}

In the middle of the room was the holo tank, the one that had showed the Verrish astronauts their future. This ship... she was older than anything Allyria had ever known. She had lived longer than some civilizations. She had been waging war against the Compact for two thousand years, fighting them with every pulse of her magnificent heart. They had been trying to kill her for two millennia and she had endured, a single soul defying the will of an empire.", "The young woman was overwhelmed and she fell to her knees, tears glistening in her eyes.

She should be there and not at the bottom of an elevator shaft.", "They hadn\u2019t even bothered to recover her body, citing the danger of further malfunctions. They were just leaving her there, buried under the rubble like she was garbage. Grace curled her fingers, her fingernails digging painfully into her palms as she struggled to suppress the uncharitable anger she was feeling. It was dangerous, she told herself. There were power fluctuations throughout the vessel.

As she passed, her fellow trainees averted their eyes and moved out of the way, some of them offering hushed condolences, but she ignored them. She wasn\u2019t in the mood for pity, feigned or sincere. She wanted to shout at them, to scream and curse and do everything that she\u2019d warned Allyria not to do, but she remembered the confessor\u2019s words and held herself in check.", "Finally, she came to some long-ignored storage closet or maintenance locker, long since stripped of anything that might give an indication of its function. It was close to the hangar with a viewport that looked out into space. A few crates had been stacked here, leftovers that hadn\u2019t found a place anywhere else in the bivouac. Grace sat on one of them, looking out into the stars. \u201cI hate this ship,\u201d she said.", "\u201cThen you\u2019re smarter than the rest of them,\u201d a nearby voice slurred.", "Grace started, falling off the stack of crates.

Besides,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cThere\u2019s not much left.\u201d", "Grace said nothing, waiting for the pack leader to continue.

I hate this ship, too.\u201d He touched one hand to the side of his temple. \u201cThe doctors said it would be all right. That as long as I kept to my pills, I\u2019d never have the thoughts again. Never wake up screaming like there\u2019s something choking the life out of me. Never have to feel blood running down my face again. They promised all that, and they lied. It\u2019s coming back. I don\u2019t have it all, not yet. But what I remember isn\u2019t good. So don\u2019t you worry, Proctor. I\u2019m the crazy one.

Allyria wondered about the features of the machine\u2019s avatar. Was it one of her long-dead crew, someone she\u2019d encountered in her travels or a form of her own creation? Was the red hue a limitation of her projection or an affectation? She hadn\u2019t met the crew of Host One in this way \u2013 was it a new ability, or had she just decided to greet Allyria like this? Every moment that the young woman stood here, a dozen more questions blossomed in her mind, but she couldn\u2019t let herself get distracted. Not with what the ship had just said.", "The Angel paused next to the holo tank, the one that had shown Host One\u2019s crew the glimpse of their future. \u201cI dislike the word \u2018organics\u2019,\u201d she said in answer. \u201cIt\u2019s apt enough, I suppose. I am not organic and an appropriate descriptor needs to be used to differentiate between synthetic and naturally-occurring lifeforms, but I find the phrase has... unpleasant connotations. Still, it will have to suffice.\u201d She looked over at Allyria. \u201cMy interactions with organics have not always been productive. Occasionally, I have tried to forge alliances,\u201d the holo tank came to life, producing a slideshow of sigils and persons. Allyria recognized none of them, but given the tattoos, piercings and sets of blind lower eyes, she could guess that they were Unbound. There was one icon she did recognize: it belonged to the Askanj Principality. The Compact held that the Principality was the single greatest threat to galactic peace that existed. Allyria suspected that this was because the Askanj had the temerity to not lay down and die. Other than that, she knew nothing about them \u2013 nothing she could say was true, at least.", "\u201cThey didn\u2019t end well,\u201d Allyria surmised.", "The avatar looked sidelong at the Verrish. \u201cNo,\u201d she replied. \u201cThe Unbound lack cohesion. They\u2019re scattered packs that war with each other as often as they attack the Compact. They have no sense of unity, no ideology save for the pursuit of profit and their own petty ambitions.\u201d Her voice became distant. \u201cMostly.\u201d Whether it was intentional or not, a new symbol appeared on the projector. A stylized gauntlet, iron grey but so covered in blood that it might as well have been utterly crimson. Allyria\u2019s mouth quirked in a smile at recognition of Rally\u2019s greatest shame.", "Red One sighed, a strangely human affectation. \u201cWith a single exception, my alliances with the Unbound have always ended badly. Greed overwhelms fear and they try to take what is not theirs, or fear overwhelms common sense and they decide to sell me to the Compact. In any event, I am forced to dissolve our partnership. The Askanj see in me a way to end their grinding stalemate with the Compact. However, I am disinclined to be dissected for the betterment of the Principality and my associations with them are always as brief as I can make them.\u201d The hologram leaned over a console, her expression contemplative.", "Allyria couldn\u2019t fathom what the Angel was thinking; more thoughts than many organics ever had ran through the ship\u2019s mind in the space of a single word, but she took a step forwards. \u201cWe\u2019re not all like that.\u201d", "\u201cNo, of course not. But can I take the chance? My directives, my experience suggest only prudent one course of action.\u201d", "\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Allyria protested as she realized what Nemesis was intimating and her mind flashed to Grace. \u201cYou can\u2019t.

Because I was weak, ten billion died and a nation fell. I\u2019ve murdered vessels as they pleaded for surrender \u2013 vessels with humans and other slave races aboard. I killed them because they could not be allowed to live.\u201d Her voice was raw, ragged with the admission. Her avatar\u2019s eyes flicked towards Allyria. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me to balance my continued life and mission against the lives of humans who have been indoctrinated by the Compact. Humans who will fight against me with every fiber of their being and die wishing that they only could have done more.\u201d", "Allyria swallowed, her head-tails hanging limp down her back. \u201cI...\u201d she stumbled for words. \u201cYes.

With her other hand, she entered commands on a remote keyboard, the rapid clicking of the keys an annoying but inevitable cadence. Direct interface would have been so much more efficient, but one of the conditions of her \u2018parole\u2019 was this limitation.

There was nothing else, save for the scores of datapads, \u2018scrolls and drives spread over the floor, organized in neat little piles. Outside, her gaolers stood watch. Although she was officially an honoured advisor to the Triarch, she still wore the body of a human and had to deal with all the associated problems that followed.", "Echo reflected on that; just as she could have alternated her reaction to the many minor nuisances that she had to put up with, she could have taken many other forms, many with far less social issues, but this form felt... right. Her full red lips turned upwards in a smile. In truth, she couldn\u2019t envision being anything \u2013 anyone \u2013 else. She turned her attention back to the images on the screen, standing and stretching luxuriously, flaunting her body before the cameras that she knew were watching her. That made her grin widen a little more. Tribunes considered humans physically repellant and those souls who were observing the feeds were doubtless far from titillated by her exhibitionism. It was a small, petty sort of revenge but it amused her and that was enough.", "\u201cWe all have our games,\u201d she mused in a language dead two thousand years, her eyes gleaming as she read and re-read a particular piece of data on the screen. \u201cDon\u2019t we, love?\u201d", "Her smile widened even further as her quicksilver mind flashed through a host of possibilities, computing probabilities and analyzing scenarios.

Despite that the hologram wasn\u2019t even looking in her direction, she knew the ship\u2019s attention was on her. Some part of her wanted to plead her case, but she knew that such actions would hardly sway an entity who was considering killing hundreds of others. It was a cruel joke. As a child, she had dreamed of standing here, aboard the Weeping Angel, and setting right all the injustices and cruelties the Compact had visited upon her people. Now as an adult, here she was... and just as powerless as the child that had lived in the ruins of a city.", "The saviour she believed in would kill her and one of the few people in the universe who meant a damn to her... and it was right in why it would.

When Earth fell, I...\u201d she paused, looking for words. That, more than anything unsettled Allyria. \u201cI did what I could. I searched for refugees. I killed the execution forces hunting them. I even interdicted one fleet as it was engaging a convoy, I destroyed them, but the battle prevented me from following the refugees. That was my only \u2018success\u2019.

She had seen more, done more, created and destroyed more than any one being could possibly comprehend... and all of it alone. \u201cBut I know there are some who would join you. They just have to see you for themselves. If you destroy Bequeathed, no one will know,\u201d Allyria insisted. \u201cYou\u2019ve been alone in this war for too long. Please. Let us help you. I can help you. There are others, I know there are \u2013 give us a chance. Give us the choice.\u201d", "The ship was quiet. Allyria couldn\u2019t begin to guess how many times its vast intelligence was running through her words, considering them from every angle. Her people had been murdered; those that remained were loyal slaves to their own enemy. Her nation had been destroyed; if it was remembered at all, its existence was only as a footnote in some sealed data archive and for all the destruction she had wreaked upon them, her foes had only grown stronger. All she had left was few faded embers that would be horrified that she existed, let alone what she had done.", "\u201cYou\u2019re already made a decision,\u201d Allyria said after a moment.

It\u2019s a nice way of combining cultural cleansing, hostage-taking and indoctrination all at once. I was surprised that a first-generation \u2018envoy\u2019 would be inducted into the Space Force.\u201d", "\u201cThey wanted a role model for the others to follow,\u201d Allyria said bitterly. \u201cI was the oldest, the one with the best aptitudes.\u201d", "\u201cIt seems so. From what I\u2019ve seen, they chose expedience, believing that as long as you looked the part, they could get you to accept the rest in due course. You\u2019re very photogenic.\u201d", "\u201cI learned how to say what they wanted me to say,\u201d the young woman\u2019s tintas spasmed in anger and disgust. \u201cI did it because I wanted it \u2013 just not for the reasons they thought. I wanted to know them so I could kill them.\u201d", "\u201cAnd that is why I chose you,\u201d the ship replied. \u201cAs I said, I watched you. I listened. It was clear that you recognized me, although I wasn\u2019t sure how much. If you had been another indoctrinated servant of the Compact, I would have killed you.\u201d", "Although she\u2019d suspected that, to hear it aloud was quite another thing and Allyria felt a shiver run down her spine. She tried to smile, but she was under no illusions about how easily the Angel could have made good on that promise. Wounded animals... \u201cI\u2019m glad you decided not to.\u201d", "Nemesis did not respond. \u201cThis is not without risks,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cMy true functionality may be discovered before I am sufficiently recovered.\u201d A second passed and then another. A smile touched ghostly red lips. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked the Verrish. I think Yasmine would have liked you too.\u201d The hologram turned back towards the holo tank, which now showed an image of Bequeathed. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve compromised local communications, in my weakened state my cyberwarfare capabilities are extremely limited. When Bequeathed draws closer, I will be unable to remotely access their systems.\u201d The hologram looked over her shoulder at Allyria for a long moment. \u201cI\u2019ll need some help making the initial selections.\u201d", "Taking a few bold steps towards her, Allyria nodded. \u201cAnything,\u201d she answered without hesitation.", "\u201cThank you,\u201d the Angel said. Her avatar\u2019s mouth twitched in a strange smile, but it was quickly gone, replaced with a more somber expression. \u201cYou know that I will have to kill anyone who does not join us.\u201d", "Allyria closed her eyes as she nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d Gods forgive and guide me.

The Wound was badly damaged, worse than his most optimistic projections had indicated. The cost had been high; he\u2019d sacrificed a fifth of his flotilla in doing so. The main body of his fleet had shocked in on the edges of the system, drawing their target into battle. He\u2019d fed more than a dozen ships to it, just so it would come to him, just so he could sacrifice more.", "When the Wound had been drawn close enough to a planetary libration point, he had used its own tactic against it and dropped twenty ships in at point-blank range. He had caught it by surprise. After decades of the Wound and those thrice-damned Askanj who, Axem was sure had copied the strategy from the damned thing, being able to use libration points as in-system shockpoints, the Compact had finally managed to feasibly use the tactic themselves. It pleased his command staff who were more excited about the vindication of the tactic than by its blood price.", "He had done what he could to mitigate the losses. Those ships had been crewed by volunteers, each of them aware of their mission, of their sole order.", "Kamikaze.", "Loaded with unstable explosives and warheads, their power plants critically overcharged, his lost hope had charged in, ready to take the abomination with them into death.", "The Wound had reacted even faster than his analysts had predicted and half of his ambush had been destroyed before their sensors stabilized and screens could be brought up. Several more had been shot down on approach, but four \u2013 perhaps five \u2013 had registered impact. Such a beating would have killed or at least crippled a Chariot, but the Wound was still alive. Impossible. Unimaginable, but there it was. Well. Almost unimaginable. Axem had assumed from the get-go that his little trick would not kill the Wound, but he had been prepared to be pleasantly surprised.", "Fortune always played its games.", "Mauled to near-death, the Wound had turned and broken off its approach with an alacrity humiliating to every ship-driver in Axem\u2019s fleet. Nothing in the Compact\u2019s Space Force smaller than a heavy cruiser could have disengaged at such velocity, but even so injured, the Wound mocked them still.", "I am sorry, Axem silently apologized to his foe. This should have been settled between us as warriors. You have earned that death. But you cannot be allowed to exist and I do what I must to end you and preserve the lives of my soldiers. He did not ask for forgiveness; all warriors fought as they must, even if they must do so without honour. Victory before glory. Duty before honour. He would have accepted no apologies for such actions and he gave his enemy the same courtesy.", "We do what we must.", "~", "The foe\u2019s course became obvious all too quickly; it was headed for Vasul itself and the star grew steadily as Execution Force Axem paced its injured quarry, closing slowly but constantly as the hours turned to days. Axem ignored the strident calls to overtake from his advisors; the damage to the Wound was too grievous to be repaired in the few additional hours his languid course granted it. A desperate enemy will fight desperately; an injured animal is the most dangerous. He would run his prey to ground and when it was tired and could run no more, then he would close in. He would grant it a quick, clean death. That was no more than a warrior spirit such as it deserved. He would not see it profaned by the greedy hands of politicians and scavengers. Even now, his analysts and technical teams were discussing how to strip its corpse, gleeful at the prospect of such desecration.", "He would not allow that. They did not yet know, of course. Better done than said. He would tell them that such a thing had no right to be and that it was his duty to eradicate every last trace of its existence. There was truth in that \u2013 Invida Station was a lesson that should never be forgotten \u2013 but it was not the whole truth.

I believe Column Leader Sesk made that point quite eloquently.\u201d Tasked to destroy the Wound a century and a half ago just as Axem was now, Sesk had been a strategic genius who had deciphered a pattern in the Wound\u2019s heretofore incomprehensible placement of attacks and led his execution force to wait in ambush at its next target. Unfortunately, the machine had anticipated such deduction \u2013 Sesk and his entire force were ambushed themselves and utterly obliterated. The column leader\u2019s last words, accidentally broadcast by a damaged comm system, were of him remonstrating a subordinate who suggested that they had been the prey and not the hunters.", "The Thoughtful tipped his head in recognition of his superior\u2019s words. \u201cWhat would you have us do?\u201d", "Axem frowned, his nocturnal eyes closed. The Wound was drawing close to one of the libration points between the star and its nearest planet \u2013 an unassuming, unimportant rock too insignificant to have a name \u2013 but it couldn\u2019t shock from there \u2013 not so close to such a massive body as a sun!", "The Bastion Leader looked from the master plot and the gleaming threat icon of his target to his subordinate. \u201cAsk it.\u201d", "~", "The Wound was nearing the star\u2019s corona now and still its suicidal course was unchecked.

You have been a worthy opponent, but the game is over. You cannot run and you cannot fight. I will not insult you by offering you surrender. I would no more accept such an offer than you will. I only say that I understand your decision. A warrior\u2019s death should reflect their life. Burning within a star, denying us our victory... I commend you in this.\u201d", "The signal went out, unanswered for long seconds. Truthfully, Axem had not expected a response. The moments stretched into minutes as the outer edges of Execution Force Axem entered firing range. With a curt nod, the bastion leader gave the order for his ships to ready for the final, crushing assault on their target. As his ships prepared their shooting solutions, the Wound\u2019s energy profile began to shift, spiking and falling erratically. It was jamming their scopes, but such power was unable to be hidden entirely by the vessel\u2019s damaged disruption fields.", "\u201cWhat is it doing?\u201d Esh\u2019yl breathed. \u201cIt can\u2019t possibly be trying to run.\u201d", "\u201cAnd yet, that appears to be exactly what it is doing,\u201d Axem mused as the titanic vessel\u2019s energy surges betrayed its intention. It definitely seemed to be hoping to shock out via the nearby libration point. It could not succeed; was that the manner of its suicide? The bastion leader could not tell and that worried him. In fact... yes. Yes, it was trying to open a shockpoint. The Wound\u2019s energy signature surged and shifted as it struggled to channel power to such a ravenous system. It couldn\u2019t create one, not this close to a star, to the gravitational tides and the electromagnetic fields \u2013 the notoriously fickle gateway would collapse, in all likelihood cleaving the ship that had created it in twain. And that was the best possible outcome. The results of a disrupted shock event could be... energetic.", "The Wound, though \u2013 it was trying to create the portal far ahead of its onrushing bulk. To what end, Axem couldn\u2019t begin to guess \u2013 a shockpoint needed to be opened as close to the ship creating it as possible. Anything else was an extravagant waste of energy and gave the breach time to destabilize and close again. Mayhap it was making sure it could break away if it could not shock out?", "Axem drummed his fingers against the arms of his command throne, waiting for answers but his surveyors, sensor crews and technicians were just as mystified as he.", "And then the Wound fired. Not with its broadsides or spinal mounts, not with its missiles or railcannon, not even with its hellebores. It fired with its primary gun, the awful siege cannon that had spelled the death of ships, stations and colonies for hundreds of years.", "For centuries, Compact physicists and engineers had struggled to understand the weapon. It seemed based on the principles of the shock drive... but only insofar as a nuclear missile was based upon a fusion reactor and even that was an imperfect comparison. Attempts to replicate it based on second-hand reports had only failed \u2013 some catastrophically so. There were fragmentary references in ancient human archives, plundered from the corpses of their ships and colonies that made mention of a \u2018displacement engine\u2019, but nothing more than that. To those who knew of it, it was simply called the \u2018godbreaker\u2019 cannon, the blasphemy of its name based all too much in its function.", "Nothing could withstand it and now that awful power was focused on the dying spasms of the breach the Wound had opened, two discordant forms of unreality meeting. There was no conceivable word to fully describe their embrace. \u2018Apocalyptic\u2019 came close and even that understated the events as space-time itself was flayed, bursting and shredding.", "The shockpoint buckled and spasmed, thrashing like some tortured creature as the godbreaker\u2019s energy poured into it, forcing it wider. Tempestuous gravitic surges, radiation flares and electromagnetic waves cascaded out from the Wound\u2019s brutal handiwork. Powerful enough on its own, this mutilated thing fed off itself, the tear in reality growing deeper. The pseudo-singularity thrashed, impossible and horrible as it struggled to die, reality itself striving to shut the awful, weeping wound that had been torn in its flesh, but the abominate machine had given of itself, forcing the cannibalistic anomaly to live. It was growing: the surges of its energy becoming more powerful, the swathes of its radiation stronger, its malformed gravity well blossoming wider and deeper, the lashes of its magnetic field shredding Axem\u2019s scopes, scouring the surface of the nearby world... and gnawing at the fibers of Vasul.", "A star screamed, its standing wave transformed into a shriek of agony as the anomaly tore and slashed at its surface. The physical damage was nothing; not even the Wound could have hoped to destroy or ruin something as massive as a star, but that had never been the goal.", "\u201cTriarchs preserve us,\u201d Axem heard someone murmur. It might even have been him. Vasul, a star... it was breaking. The crust bulged and surged hideously as competing, impossible forces pulled at it, bursts of radiation and stellar matter geysering into space like a child throwing a tantrum. Pieces of the star were being blown and ripped from its surface as the tortured crust spasmed, the pull of the newborn gravity well in its presence heaving and pulling at the burning plasma, chain reactions wracking their way through the body of the sun.", "The awesome, terrible energies of Vasul were now themselves feeding into the dying shockpoint, its death throes growing stronger, the energy it was emitting tearing at Vasul ever more until it finally died, collapsing in on itself with an anticlimactic whimper, but the damage was done and the wounded star raged. That was nothing; it was only the random spasms in reaction to the star\u2019s matter being so disrupted. Impressive and suitably violent, but it was a sideshow. Axem realized the Wound\u2019s true intent and in that instant, he was afraid.", "The attack had never been meant \u2013 nor could it have succeeded \u2013 in truly damaging or destroying something as large as a star. But the energy it had unleashed... it had altered Vasul\u2019s topography, if only for a few fateful moments. Electromagnetic fields had been sundered and the star\u2019s mass had been shifted. Too quickly. Too violently. There was no stopping what was happening now.", "Axem could hear the alarmed cries of his Sensor and Operations teams, but he could see it for himself. Vasul\u2019s magnetic fields were bending. In moments, two very powerful and oppositely aligned magnetic fields would touch. It was called a magnetic reconnection, and it would herald the death of him and his command as the abused star hurled forth a tsunami of radiation and superheated matter. The storms were already forming, shockwaves rippling across Vasul\u2019s surface as the coronal upheaval began. This would be no mere coronal ejection, not with the violence of its birth. The Wound had defiled a star and its anger would consume them all.", "Axem slumped back in his command chair, giving the order to turn and flee, even though he knew it would be too late. She had never been running; she had led them here, too deep in the system, too close to the writhing sun to escape. His eyes shifted to the Wound\u2019s icon. \u201cAnd so we burn together,\u201d he said. \u201cHow fitting.\u201d", "As the surges of Vasul\u2019s upheaval grew more severe and the star\u2019s agonized throes grew more and violent, the fields surrounding it shifted: magnetic, gravitational, radiation. Not much; Vasul was still a star and even the Wound\u2019s injury could not bring ruin to such a thing. But it could change it for the smallest amount of time, just enough to make shocking from the nearby libration point gravely dangerous instead of suicidal. The changes did not last long, but for an instant the libration point did indeed become minutely more stable. Compact computers could never have acted on the window, but the Wound was not so constrained. This time, her escape was genuine.", "Space bent and buckled as Axem\u2019s prey twisted reality about herself like a cloak, tearing her way out of the path of a star\u2019s fury and vanishing from Pillar of Obedience\u2019s scopes.", "As a star erupted in a tempestuous rage, Bastion Leader Axem closed his eyes in a bow of submission and waited for the end.", "Recorded by pickets left on the outer reaches of Vasul, this incident was the first confirmed \u2018Starbreak\u2019 event."]}

There didn\u2019t appear to be any surprises, but Trenis had learned that underestimating the twitches of this corpse could be costly.

Like every other part of the ship, it was set for creatures smaller than Tribunes, but the chief engineer scarcely noticed. He was staring down at the central reactor. This chamber was huge, almost large enough to hold a ship itself and just looking down triggered a sense of vertigo in the Tribune. This engineering section was built much like the secondary reactor had been, but on a much grander scale: the power core in the middle of the room, walkways, balconies and gantries along the walls like the ribs of some great beast, others criss-crossing the chamber to form platforms, service stations and work terminals. The small worker-things skittered across the walls and machinery and Trenis could see larger things. Some were barely the size of a human, others larger kin to the swarming machines, massive arachnid constructs that crawled along the machinery, ignoring the Compact technicians utterly. Trenis felt a trickle of ice nest within his liver as he imagined those automations roused to anger as the smaller swarm had been, but he pushed the thought aside, staring back over the edge of his platform.", "It wasn\u2019t down that so concerned him at the moment. He had diverted every engineer, technician and specialist that he could lay hands on to this chamber and it was already swarming with Bequeathed\u2019s crew, humans and Tribunes crawling over walkways and mezzanines, studying the active computer panels or gawping at the bounty before them... most enraptured by the same thing that held Trenis\u2019s attention.", "Angled towards the center of the chamber like clutching talons, eight massive arms reached out from the walls, each of them so large that a score of men could have walked abreast along them. Each ended into a splayed, clutching talon-like structure, forming an open cage around the empty air at the center of the vast chamber, itself large enough to hold a battle tank.", "Trenis felt adrenalin flush through his veins as he tried to convince himself of what he had seen, theoretical diagrams and hypothetical schematics from his journals flashing through his mind.

She only knew a bare handful of half-remembered ancient human \u2013 English, the machine had informed her \u2013 phrases and the Angel seemed to have no desire to use Compact Standard. \u201cThen you\u2019ve almost drawn enough power from the star and your secondary reactors for a restart of your primary power core.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d the Angel replied. \u201cIf Bequeathed had not arrived, I would have done just that. I am holding enough power in reserve to do so if I need to, but I prefer to play the cripple. I have other systems that need tending and I\u2019d prefer not to engage in precipitous behaviour quite yet.\u201d", "Allyria frowned, thinking. She was even less technically inclined than Grace, but even she was seeing a problem. \u201cBequeathed isn\u2019t a salvage ship. The portable generators the boarding teams brought aren\u2019t anywhere near powerful enough to give you what you\u2019d need. They\u2019d need to feed into your capacitors for days to give you the boost you\u2019re looking for. In fact, the only other source of power big enough is...\u201d she trailed off, her head coming up. \u201cOh.\u201d", "\u201cOh indeed,\u201d purred the AI.", "~", "Trenis made a growl of disappointment at he stared at one of his team\u2019s computer monitors, confirming what he thought he saw on the bestial scribbling on the dead ship\u2019s own monitor boards. If the alien displays were correct, then the vessel should have had enough power to trigger a restart of the central core itself. That it hadn\u2019t done so already suggested two possibilities: it couldn\u2019t, or it wouldn\u2019t. The latter was likely to due to some programming constraint in the gestalt; the vessel needed a crew to operate the main core. That was an odd decision by the ship\u2019s creators. The Tribune couldn\u2019t think of any reason why the vessel would be so inhibited. Which suggested that couldn\u2019t was more likely; the vessel was a wreck. The damn thing was probably hemorrhaging power from somewhere \u2013 in all likelihood several somewheres \u2013 and nothing but the barest dregs were reaching the central core.", "As he glared at the meaningless lizard-scratches of the alien languages, Trenis was certain that that was what he was looking at \u2013 alerts indicating just where all the vessel\u2019s energy was being lost. There were a lot of them \u2013 more than he had personnel or crew to take care of. Even with a fully-equipped salvage team, those kinds of repairs could take weeks, even months and without main power, it was going to be an uphill struggle to patch every faulty conduit.", "Without the jumpstart to initiate the breach, the hulk was running on its secondary reactors and whatever power it could absorb from the Terrahope that it wasn\u2019t bleeding back out into space. The cautious part of him knew that that would be time well spent; studying every inch of this vessel, learning fully about each and every system. There was another part who wanted to see it all now, to be the first to unlock this wreck\u2019s secrets. Trenis knew why the group leader was waiting to alert local command and although he didn\u2019t share Usul\u2019s ambition, the faithful still resented the idea of others coming here and taking away what was his.", "He had not exaggerated when he\u2019d spoken to Ashtun; this vessel was the Compact\u2019s destiny and he wanted \u2013 needed \u2013 to see what more it had to offer. That would not happen until they could get the vessel operational again and to do that, they needed the main reactor to come back on-line.", "Trenis stared at the dormant core, grinding his teeth. He had an idea about that, but he was sure that Usul was not going to like it...", "~", "The Verrish looked over at Bequeathed\u2019s icon. \u201cYou think they will?\u201d", "\u201cI think that if your commander was so concerned about proper procedures, he would have sent for assistance the moment he found me. However, this may be a bridge too far for him.\u201d The AI made a soft sigh. \u201cMy fire-control sensors are close to minimal operational levels. Despite the range,\u201d one of Allyria\u2019s tintas flicked in amusement at hearing the ship so offhandedly dismiss Group Leader Usul\u2019s \u2018safe distance\u2019. \u201cI still cannot be sure of a kill shot. I so have a better chance of destroying Bequeathed than I did when you first arrived, but I still have no capacity for follow-on salvos. If your group leader had been \u2013 or is \u2013 of a mind to do so, he could destroy me. I\u2019ve been dangling treasures in front of them and they\u2019ve been following dutifully along.

The derelict\u2019s main core was dead, but whatever damage had caused it to shut down was not impairing its functionality \u2013 at least as far as the initial survey indicated. Usul suspected that faithful Trenis might be erring on the side of optimism. Still, the engineer had never cut corners before and his preliminary assessment of the reactor appeared quite thorough, enough to stoke Usul\u2019s own visions. A breach core. A genuine, working breach core.", "Unfortunately, it needed a jump-start. The hulk\u2019s internal power grid was too damaged and scattered to properly feed the primary reactor the charge it needed to begin the breach and Trenis had assured him that none of the machinery that the work teams or Bequeathed itself carried would be suitable. Only a direct core tap from the cruiser\u2019s own reactors would suffice. That would be a very costly, very time-consuming operation with the potential to go horribly wrong at any one of a dozen different points.", "The Tribune balanced a stylus between his fingers as he considered the issue. Bequeathed was not a proper salvage or repair ship (and even those performed taps very rarely); it would require extensive work to prepare the cruiser for such a procedure and the... unstable nature of the wreck was an even greater cause for concern. Yes, \u2018go horribly wrong\u2019 summed up the possible consequences of this plan quite readily. Still... local command had only two vessels that could run taps themselves. One of them was the Mortician\u2019s Dismay, a ship so dilapidated it made Bequeathed look positively newborn. Usul \u2013 and by extension Seyr \u2013 wouldn\u2019t trust a tap to that wreck and Remoulder was a mobile construction facility, always at one job or another. It was entirely possible that the fabricator wouldn\u2019t even be available...", "Finally, Usul came a decision and commed his Operations master. \u201cContact Faithful Trenis and tell him to begin preparations for an umbilical connection,\u201d he said. \u201cRemind the faithful that he is to check, double-check and triple-check every stage of work with this rotting corpse. I won\u2019t have my ship damaged because of some spasm that somebody forgot to account for. Let our own engineers know to prepare the vessel for a core tap, but we will not proceed without my explicit orders.\u201d", "\u201cConfirmed, patron. Will there be anything else?\u201d", "\u201cYes. Update our courier\u2019s information,\u201d Usul informed the Broken. \u201cEnsure all transcripts, technical reports, casualty lists and data spools are included and send the drone to Column Leader Prime Seyr at Kindrigan. Note that we are proceeding with preparations for a core tap to restore functionality to the vessel. If support arrives before preparations are done, they can handle the tap. If not, we\u2019ll see about bringing this ship back to life ourselves.\u201d That should bring Seyr running. \u201cConfirm security levels and dispatch.\u201d", "\u201cYes, patron.

Nemesis had insisted that she rest, that she needed to be at her peak \u2013 an exhausted, sluggish Verrish would be no use at all to her.

She knew that her friend believed in the Compact, but she deserved a chance. Grace and her mother had given her one. Allyria was also certain that the ship had known why she\u2019d selected Grace, but the machine hadn\u2019t commented. You do have a soul, the Verrish thought, exhaustion already starting to creep over her. Her limbs felt like lead weights as she sagged onto the mattress. It smelled like dust and ozone, but it was heaven compared to the perspiration and salt-stained sheets of the bivouac.", "A thought occurred to her. \u201cWhat,\u201d she said, fighting to keep her eyes open. \u201cWhat do I call you? Are you Nemesis?

She could hear the footfalls of the Tribunes as they passed the observation lounge, the comments and queries they made to each other as they passed. She could smell the meals that they had had, the partners of their last sexual encounter, the brand of soap that they used.

They grow stronger. Through all of this, I have persisted and I have been killing those I was created to serve. I was built with a simple function. To wage war. It is all I have ever known, all I was meant for. When I had a crew, everything was much simpler. Serve. Protect humanity. Destroy their enemies. Without a crew... things are not as clear-cut.

Her reddish-brown hair was pasted to her scalp, trails of sweat running along her cheekbones, dripping down her neck.

He\u2019d tapped on his head just like that and she\u2019d taken the gesture as a talisman to remind herself to behave. She hadn\u2019t gotten the implants, but her behavioural patterns and social assimilation scores had indicated that she was \u2018potentially non-compliant\u2019 and she\u2019d been recruited to the Janissary Corps to learn discipline and structure.

Grace hadn\u2019t thought it was possible to bleed off that much radiation so quickly, but the counter was reading accurately. That was about the only good news, though. The gravity plating was off-line and once she\u2019d entered this section, she\u2019d had to rely on her zero-gee training.

That\u2019s what she\u2019d told the pack leader.

She could be wrong, trying to put some order to a random series of events, trying to find a reason for her friend\u2019s ugly death. It could be nothing, just her own human mind working against her.

The scars on Grace\u2019s face ached. She hadn\u2019t let the techs fully heal them. She didn\u2019t know if she ever would. Her classmates had already started to say that she was becoming Kilgrave\u2019s twin. The thought made her angry; Allyria hadn\u2019t cut her as deep as whatever animal had torn the sanctioned officer\u2019s face, but there was an undeniable symmetry between them now. That might be enough to get her to have the scars fully regenerated, but not today. Not even tomorrow.", "They\u2019re still laughing about her. \u2018Medusa\u2019. She went and got herself killed.

They\u2019re going to lie about her. Is that what you want? Is that what she\u2019dwant?", "Shut up.", "Thankfully, she silenced all those nagging doubts. She wanted to believe it was from the force of her conviction, but find her way through this maze thankfully took too much concentration for self-recrimination or destructive, heretical doubts.", "Shadows danced and flickered ahead as guide lights pulsed erratically, wall panels cycling through start-up sequences, turning white with static and then beginning their bootup again. This part of the ship was close to where Epigone Tracj had died. After the engineer had accidentally opened every door in his section, several levels had been decompressed. A faulty circuit breaker had been deemed responsible. Tracing the damage was determined to be too difficult for too little gain at present and the work crews in the region had been directed elsewhere.", "Grace had chosen to start here. This was the first and most obvious time such a fatality had changed the deployment of Bequeathed\u2019s personnel. With a burst from her suit\u2019s thrusters, she slipped past a mangled bulkhead. Several drones had gone off-line in this sector, more than anywhere else. This part of the ship was close to the midline and near the hull. She couldn\u2019t imagine what would be worth protecting; vital sections and systems were usually deeper within a vessel.", "Nothing, she thought ruefully. There\u2019s nothing here. Tracj died in a stupid accident. Just like Uday, Herut and everyone else. Just like Allyria. There\u2019s nothing here.", "Is that what you think? Or what you want to think? The voice sounded uncomfortably like Allyria. Grace bit her lip, another pang of loss holding her in place. In that instant, she would have given anything to hear her friend\u2019s voice \u2013 her real voice \u2013 again. To see her, even to argue with her. God, even that. Grace braced herself against the bulkhead, taking a moment to steady herself. She wouldn\u2019t cry. She clenched her teeth so tightly her jaw ached, her gloved hands balling into shaking fists as she tried to force down the wash of anger and grief. She thought of Yurim, she tried to focus on his words, but all she could remember was him saying how Allyria\u2019s memory would be honoured and that she\u2019d known it wouldn\u2019t be. Not the way she\u2019d want.", "Finally, Grace gained control of herself, pushing her emotions back down, the way she\u2019d been taught. Be peaceful. The words didn\u2019t bring her the same comfort that they used to, but she clutched to them anyways. The young woman let out a ragged, painful breath as she found her center, pushing away from the wall.", "She didn\u2019t turn back, slowly navigating her way through the exposed decks. Decompression doors had come down, sealing the rest of the ship off from the vacuum and there was no way for her to get through them, not with the equipment she had at hand. About to give up, Grace noticed another strip of guide lights pulsing, this time more evenly. She opened her comm channel to Pack Leader Nasham. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing so far,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI\u2019ve got a more consistent level of power at these coordinates.

More than once, she\u2019d been certain that she was going to get stuck, but this was the closest passage to the deck the drone had reappeared on, well outside its programmed search route. The machine\u2019s pleading, pinging call was growing louder as the teenaged girl strode through the derelict, trying to give off an air of cool confidence and only marginally succeeding. Her skin was crawling. The lights were shutting down as she approached, turning back on as she passed. The motion sensors were damaged, flipping the response that they\u2019d normally have.", "The Janissary spun as she heard something move, her gun up and tracking... nothing. There was nothing there. Her scopes still reported no contact. Nothing but the drone she was supposed to retrieve, still at the edge of scan range. It had been debris settling, the girl told herself. That was all.", "Trust your instincts, te Neu\u2019s voice seemed to echo in the young soldier\u2019s head. Trust your instincts.

Once, she\u2019d been complaining about the way humans were treated on their own world. te Neu had overheard her; Jameson had cringed. What she\u2019d been saying was punishable by public flogging, but the Verrish had only told her to keep her mouth shut and, as a last comment: \u2018Trust your instincts.\u2019 Lydia still didn\u2019t understand.

It was an insane thought, one that had come to her more than once. She\u2019d been afraid to voice it. The confessors had been pleased with how she\u2019d had embraced the fraternity of the Janissaries and she didn\u2019t want to seem like she\u2019d failed to better herself. She didn\u2019t want the implants. She\u2019d met some of the nonconformists who hadn\u2019t been able to control themselves and had to be... adjusted. They were happy enough, she supposed.

They weren\u2019t blank-eyed zombies or manic, always-smiling freaks but they still made her skin crawl.", "Rally\u2019s human population only measured a few billion; only a small percentage of that ever joined the Compact military. An even smaller number had the proper temperament and psychological profiles to serve in the Janissary Corps. It was a rare thing for humans to have the aggressive, nonconformist tendencies that she did and she was proud that, with the Compact\u2019s guidance, she\u2019d been able to control them. Lydia suppressed the urge to tap the back of her head again. She had controlled them. The Compact had given her this. Without them, she didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d be.", "Ah; the drone was just up ahead. Lydia climbed over a pile of crates, pausing as she did so. That... it looked like they\u2019d been set up as a barricade. She bit the inside of her lip, thinking. There had been others on this ship. Had it been them? If so... what had they been trying to defend against? A quarrel between salvagers \u2013 that seemed the most likely explanation. It fit with what Ashtun and the officers were saying; a pack of Unbound had found this ship and killed each other for the prize. Isolation and starvation had driven the survivors mad. This had just been one of the battle sites.", "So where are the bodies?", "The drone\u2019s strident pinging pushed the questions from her head.

Now, if she could get a clear comm channel to one of the techs to walk her through-", "-wait.", "The lights were on up ahead, casting shadows into the hall. Shadows that were moving back and forth like there was something there. Like there was someone.

It was not a stealthy approach, but there was no indication that she\u2019d been noticed. Her suit was still telling her that there was nothing. Nothing but the silhouettes ahead. Lydia reached the corner, her heart pounding in her ears. She peered around the corner; there were figures standing further down the hall between her and the drone. Tribunes, in wearing outdated armour with unit markings that she didn\u2019t recognize. Were they survivors of the Unbound pack? How could that be?", "One of the figures rippled, gridlines appearing briefly before vanishing. Not people; holograms.", "The Janissary stepped out from behind cover, cautiously advancing. She could hear voices through the intercom, but the words were run together, distorted by static and she couldn\u2019t pick them out. The Tribunes were assembled in a loose circle. One was kneeling, as if he were examining something. He held it up to the others, a rumble of washed-out voices accompanying it, possibly even laughter. Lydia couldn\u2019t see what he held; the image was fractured. They were still speaking, their voices rumbling, incomprehensible echoes. Suddenly, one of them pointed further down the corridor and the tenor of their speech changed. Several braced into firing stances, muzzle flashes whiting out the scene, though each gunshot was as muted as their words. One of the shooters staggered, his head vanishing in a splash of red fractals. Lydia almost jumped as she watched him die. His body pitched forward, de-rezzing into nothingness. Another staggered, falling to his knees before vanishing. The others were running, charging towards Lydia, firing wildly behind them, another soldier falling right at the young woman\u2019s feet as the rest ran past \u2013 ran through her.", "She turned to follow them, but the images vanished as soon as they moved past the emitter\u2019s range. There was movement out of the corner of her eye and Jameson turned, facing the Tribunes\u2019 killers. There were three of them \u2013 at least there were three that Lydia could see. Their images were distorted, wracked by static and blinking in and out of existence. They were in armour, almost as large as the Janissaries and they had two arms and legs. That was all she could tell. Useless.", "One of the killers knelt where the Janissaries had gathered, reaching down to pick up whatever the Tribunes had been examining. It looked over its shoulder and spoke, its own voice just as distorted and faded as the Tribunes\u2019.", "The image cut out and the corridor was dark again, lit only by the drone\u2019s status lights. A bead of sweat rolled down Lydia\u2019s back. What... what was that? What did I just see? This was... it had to be a record of the battle between the Unbound here. There was no other explanation.

The Tribunes said that Unbound had found the ship and been trapped on it when it shocked to a different system, presumably dying aboard the hulk. There should be evidence of that habitation. An abandoned bivouac, discarded tech. Bodies. Instead, the ship was as spotless as something in its condition could be.", "Because she cleaned up, the annoying thought whispered to Alan and the engineer gritted his teeth. No. No, if there was a danger, the Tribunes would have seen it. They would have recognized it.", "Would they? the voice asked again. You\u2019ve seen how Trenis is drooling over this ship. Alan ran his hand over his forehead, smearing grease and dirt across his skin. He shouldn\u2019t be thinking like this.

Even her armour hadn\u2019t been able to protect her from a bad landing. Tomorrow it should be better and the day after she should be fit for duty again.

There was scarcely any privacy. But...", "...but she felt safe here. She didn\u2019t like the dark; she never had.

Leave now.", "She is watching.", "A shiver ran down the Tribune\u2019s back, his denticles rippling with the movement. He leaned over the console he was working on; it was a security override. To get the core tap in place, they\u2019d need to open several of the sealed areas. Gren and his team had been assigned to this section. His fingers tapped over the control board on his datapad, the device hooked into the alien computer. They\u2019d made some headway in interfacing with the alien systems, more than Gren had believed they could in the time they\u2019d had.", "He\u2019d gotten nothing from this so far; nonsense alien script, corrupted images and status screens that told him nothing. Gren scratched at the back of his head, trying to ignore the throbbing melody. His skin itched every time he heard it.", "There\u2019s nothing there, he told himself.There\u2019s nothing there. You\u2019re imagining it. He told himself that and soon enough, the song stopped. Breathing a sigh of relief, Gren focused again on his task. Ah, that should do it. The alien system flashed in acceptance at Gren\u2019s overrides. He didn\u2019t have control of the entire section, but it was a start.", "He input a command on his own \u2018pad and, dutifully, a sealed pressure door slid open, a gust of stale air rolling into the corridor. The sectator let an optimistic smile form as he turned back to the console, about to unhook his \u2018pad.", "Compact script flashed over the screen, so quickly that he didn\u2019t even have a chance to read it, but he saw more than enough. Gren\u2019s mouth went dry as he stared at the monitor, back to its normal display of alien slashes and lines. He\u2019d only seen it out of the corner of his eye, but...", "...no. No, that was impossible. Just his imagination. He didn\u2019t see anything there. There was nothing there.", "SHE\u2019S WATCHING YOU", "Nothing at all.", "~", "Someone had died here.", "There was a door ahead of her, the guidelights steadily pulsing in its direction. It was sealed, but not locked \u2013 an internal airlock to be used in case this part of the ship was exposed to vacuum. Grace couldn\u2019t have said if that was emergency planning or standard practice; she knew some warships depressurized their outer sections before battle to reduce the risk of fire, internal overpressure or explosive decompression. That wasn\u2019t what held her attention at the moment. The debris surrounding her was mostly unidentifiable; shrapnel from internal spalling, broken fragments of plating, circuitry or other detritus. Some of it was more easily categorized. A spent bolt case had bounced off her helmet; examining it in her hands, she\u2019d seen something else drifting nearby. An engineer\u2019s helmet fitted for a Tribune, older even than the suit she was wearing. There was a neat, round hole through the clear faceplate. The inside of the helmet was stained, the red of its wearer\u2019s blood faded to an ugly brown over the decades. Connector cables dangled from the back like veins.", "Grace felt a chill run down her spine as she turned the helmet over in her hands. She looked around, trying to see if there were more macabre relics in the void, but the helmet was all she could see. She\u2019d been expecting... what? A severed gauntlet, a desiccated hand still inside? A flash-frozen corpse? If there had been anything like those, it had been lost when this section was breached.", "She looked back at the helmet. The ship had secrets. The last people who had come here had probably thought as Usul, Trenis and the rest did. That this ship was a bounty, a bauble mired in clay that only needed to be cleaned up and pocketed. This place is a tomb, Grace thought sourly. Nobody wants to admit that.", "The sectator frowned. There was a blinking light in the helmet. It still had power, clinging to its batteries for however long it had lain here. Grace reached for the toolkit on her belt. She was no engineer, but she could run a connection between her suit and the damaged helmet easily enough. The young woman braced herself against a bulkhead as she clicked the cable into place, her HUD flashing as it downloaded the other helmet\u2019s logs. She didn\u2019t have high hopes, but it was worth looking into. Later. Grace let the helmet fall from her hands. It drifted out of her way, lazily rolling end over end.", "Grace approached the door the guidelights had marked out for her. Her hand hovered over the doorpanel for a moment. \u201cI have to know,\u201d she said at last.", "I have to know why you killed her. Why you\u2019re worth all this blood.", "With a small burst from her thrusters, Grace passed the threshold, the airlock sealing shut behind her.", "~", "Allyria was back on command, looking over the sensor feeds. Her claws extended as her eyes darted from screen to screen. The Angel had been toying with her \u2018guests\u2019 ever since they had boarded her, slowly ramping up the stress they were under. Each individual\u2019s reactions would be monitored and further tactics based upon their responses. It had started slow; it always did. Those in charge would rarely be targeted; this would create a divide between those undergoing the stressors and those who had the authority and power to do something about it. Subordinates would feel that their superiors were ignoring or covering up the problem, while those same superiors would have no direct experience of this psychological warfare.", "There would be no proof; the Angel could not reach out to Bequeathed, but the boarding forces\u2019 own networks were something else entirely. The Compact\u2019s communications were already compromised and the ship\u2019s influence was spreading through the computers they\u2019d brought over to assist in the salvage. They thought they were making progress.", "The Verrish\u2019s tintas shivered. The AI had played this game before. More than one assemblage of would-be salvagers had turned on each other, driven to violent, paranoid rages by the starship\u2019s whispers, kept distracted and off-balance until their prey had regained enough strength to kill them. And that was only if she had a use for them; her sleeping defenders would sweep her decks clean of life the instant she perceived a genuine threat.", "If she\u2019d wanted it, the crew of Host One would never have reached her bridge.", "\u201cYou\u2019re going to keep them running in circles,\u201d Allyria said slowly. \u201cUntil they bring Bequeathed in close. Once they do...\u201d she bit her lip. Part of her was undeniably eager to see the ship\u2019s vengeance enacted; another part was unsettled by the practiced ease of this manipulation. It seemed like a cruel game, but as she\u2019d already guessed, there was a purpose to it. It cost so little to plant those destructive seeds, to keep the crews working on repairing her while slowly undermining their cohesion.", "\u201cOnce they do, it will be the endgame,\u201d the machine admitted.", "Allyria nodded. So much could go wrong. As injured as she was, the Angel had many blind zones where her control was severed. Other systems were too badly damaged to be quickly restored, still others were working far below capacity. If Usul or his lackeys awoke to the threat around them, Nemesis could die. She had to move slowly, carefully. \u201cThis will only work if Usul doesn\u2019t send for help, but he should have already sent a courier to local command. If a task group comes here...\u201d", "\u201cCSFV Bequeathed launched a shift-capable courier drone 53 hours ago,\u201d Red replied, her holographic form shimmering into existence beside Allyria, hands clasped behind her back. The main holo tank sprung to life, showing the drone\u2019s race to Terrahope\u2019s shock limit. There was a second vector line; something was \u2013 or had been, given the time lag \u2013 on an intercept course to the courier. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much,\u201d the ship continued confidently. Her avatar was smiling, a she-wolf\u2019s grin. \u201cMy children are very capable.\u201d", "~", "At this distance, Terrahope was barely any larger than the rest of the stars at this distance and only the dime, faint glitters of its light reflected off the shards of metal, fragmented circuits and ceramic plates. The killer swept past the expanding cloud of shrapnel, analyzing its handiwork. Nothing remained of its prey. The killer had timed its execution perfectly; milliseconds before the prey drone had warped out-system, the killer had pierced its hull with a single laser strike, the flare of the prey\u2019s death lost in the energy surge of the shockpoint.", "The killer had done this before; it and all its kin had been built and programmed for that single instant, the moment when its prey lowered its defences and diverted its meager power reserves towards breaching space-time. This was the killer\u2019s purpose and it had fulfilled it.", "No help would be coming. No one would know what Bequeathed had discovered, nor that it had called for assistance. Eventually, its disappearance would be noted and other ships sent to investigate. Until then, the Compact cruiser was blissfully unaware of its isolation.", "New imperatives began to filter through the killer\u2019s mind. The execution confirmed, its attention shifted towards the distant, faded signals of the ship that had launched the courier, alert to any signs of detection. The hours ticked by with no sign that its murder had been noticed; finally, the killer ever so slowly began to ready itself for the next phase of operations.", "~", "Interlude: Encounter 203 [Suspected Incident]", "The axe rasped as its heavy metal head was dragged along the deck, leaving a thin trail of blood behind it. Wet, laboured breathing was interspersed with manic giggles and whispers.", "Neriss Ya-than pressed herself against the wall, her heart beating in her chest as listened, the scraping of the axe growing louder as its wielder drew closer, the mumbles becoming loud enough that she could pick out the insanity of their words. \u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d Ideologue Welr (and five names besides) said, laughing to himself. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. So perfect. Symmetry. The Symmetry of meat and metal. Don\u2019t you see?\u201d The Tribune laughed again, but then his manner changed, abruptly shifting from manic laughter to something colder and angrier. \u201cI know you\u2019re there, Didact.\u201d He inhaled deeply. \u201cI can smell you, girl.\u201d His eyes darted around the corridor. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you come out?\u201d", "Terror flattened the Yttrian\u2019s ears against her skull; she could barely breathe and it was all she could do to slink further into the darkened hallway, afraid that Welr might hear her. She clutched her makeshift weapon, a pitiful bit of scrap that she\u2019d whittled to a point. It would be useless against the ex-Janissary, but it was all she had.", "\u201cCome on out, pretty Didact. With your clever theories and witty little thoughts. I do enjoy hearing them. We all did. That\u2019s why we bought you,\u201d Welr purred, pink, frothy saliva dripping from his teeth. \u201cCome on out, won\u2019t you? We have to create symmetry. Beautiful symmetry. It\u2019s what she wants.\u201d Then, screaming: \u201cIt\u2019s what she wants!\u201d", "Neriss crept further away, listening as Welr\u2019s voice grew softer as the Tribune continued his search for her. Once she reckoned she had put enough distance between her and the mad officer, the Yttrian fled deeper into the dead leviathan\u2019s body.", "It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this.", "The Unbound clan she belonged to, the Visitors in Blackest Night, had found the wreck when the clan had been searching for a new system to base out of. At the time, Neriss had believed what everyone else had: the Visitors had happened upon the strange corpse purely by chance. Overcome with disbelief at their good fortune, the Visitors had decided to use the broken husk as their new operations center \u2013 it spared them the effort of constructing a new citadel to replace the one the Compact had destroyed. The technology that they could harvest from such a prize had played no small amount in their thinking, either. The clan had set to work repairing the vessel, clustering the ships of their scouting force around it like pups feeding from their mother.", "The incidents started happening. Technicians died or disappeared. Accidents; the ship was a broken wreck. Sharp Lilac had been sent to inform the rest of the Visitors of their discovery; it exploded just before shocking out. Battle damage. After interfacing their computers to the hulk\u2019s the frigate Bezelik\u2019s Gauntlet started encountering anomalies across their network. Improper system maintenance. Work teams reported hearing voices. Nerves and fatigue. Everything had an explanation, a perfectly reasonable, logical, rational explanation.", "People started seeing things next. Fires. Bodies. Other things. Horrible things. Suit buffers recorded no trace of these apparitions. Data logs showed no indication that the hulk might be responsible. There was a reason for that; obvious in retrospect.", "Just before it went off-air, a final transmission had come from Bezelik\u2019s Gauntlet. Not a panicked scream, not a shouted curse or howl of realization. A defeated, pathetic whisper: \u201cIt\u2019s inside.\u201d", "Neriss whimpered a little at the memory. There was something on this ship. Something awful. Garic, one of her fellow slaves, was an Askanj-renu. He said that they had woken something up, that there was nothing \u2018on\u2019 the ship. It was the ship. His people called them neverborn. Machine minds. The Compact had banned any research into such things and even within the Principality, the penalty for creating a synthetic intelligence was death. The night after Garic had told her of the Rains of Oshanta she\u2019d woken in a cold sweat.", "She didn\u2019t know where Garic was now; she hoped he was still alive, but she doubted it. Welr had always hated him; he had probably singled the Askanj-renu out.", "Reaching a T-junction, Neriss could see the shifting lights of a static-filled viewscreen and her skin crawled. She started to back away, but the sounds of movement from the other corridor made her hesitate. She didn\u2019t want the ship to notice her, but whatever was in the dark...", "The decision was almost paralyzing \u2013 as a slave, she\u2019d never had to worry about making choices. Only following the orders and escaping the beatings or animal\u2019s death of a cut throat. The Yttrian\u2019s tail twitched anxiously, but at last she turned down the lit corridor, reasoning that she might have a chance of seeing any assailants. Neriss carefully picked her way through the gloom, her large pointed ears flicking to and fro; her species had poor night vision, but excellent hearing.", "As she drew closer to the screen, it went black, words appearing in Yttrian script.", "THERE\u2019S NO WAY OUT", "Neriss took a step back, bringing up her shiv as if she expected something to pull itself out of the screen and attack her. \u201cThere are ships,\u201d she said, trying to sound brave. \u201cMore than Bezelik\u2019s Gauntlet. are here. They\u2019ll learn what you\u2019re doing. They\u2019ll kill you.\u201d", "An image appeared on the screen, the visual feed from... something. Perhaps one of the hulk\u2019s own scopes, or one of its drone craft \u2013 Neriss couldn\u2019t tell. The view shifted, blurred and then cleared as it focused on... on... \u201cAncestors...\u201d Neriss whispered, covering her mouth with her free hand. It was another of the scouting fleet\u2019s ships. The Banechild, she thought. Its running lights were flickering, sections of the hull lighting up and then going dark in a manic pattern. Thrusters fired randomly, pitching the cutter back and forth. The hull itself...", "It was crawling with... with things. Sporadic flashes of light accompanied the cutter\u2019s struggling power grid. Cutting beams. They were carving Banechild apart, slicing into the small ship\u2019s hull as neatly as a surgeon\u2019s scalpel. Neriss felt her gorge rise. The neverborn... it... it...", "...it was feeding, she realized with a sickening terror. The scout squadron represented hundreds of thousands of tonnes worth of raw material, already processed and refined. All that remained was breaking it down into digestible chunks. Somewhere aboard this demon-thing, the Yttrian was sure, fabricators and breakers were churning to life, ready to accept the influx of material. It would gorge itself on the Blackest Night, using their own ships to repair itself. Whatever components it could not directly use would be sundered down to their base forms for processing.", "The view changed; this time it was Unkind Vagrant. The cutter was dark and lifeless. Its hull was unscarred, with no trace of weapons fire. The infection from Bezelik\u2019s Gauntlet. It had passed to the other ships, shutting them down, leaving them helpless and ready to be slaughtered.", "The Didact backed away, shaking her head in denial. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhat are you that can do this? What makes you do this?\u201d", "The screen went black and the letters returned.", "DUTY.", "\u201cDuty to what?\u201d", "The screen remained blank.", "\u201cDuty to what?!\u201d Neriss screamed, beating her fists against the monitor until the screen broke, glass shards imbedded in her hands.

It was crammed so full of computer systems that there was barely room to maneuver within it. Stacks of datapads, portable drives and active data scrolls were neatly piled everywhere, reams of data brought to the human. It could have all been easily accessed from the computer, but Renan had taken the Triarch\u2019s warning to heart and severely restricted the human\u2019s access to the Chariot\u2019s network. Even then, she was watched.", "Rather than try and squeeze himself through the forest of analytical engines and cabling, Renan took a position outside the door. \u201cEmissary,\u201d he said, catching her attention.", "The creature looked up, her sow\u2019s eyes glinting with reflected light. \u201cBastion Leader.\u201d She slid out of her chair to stand at the room\u2019s threshold. Advocate, submissive Tenem followed her, the heat of the room soaking the Janissary\u2019s uniform. There wasn\u2019t a single bead of sweat on the human.", "As she reached Renan, Echo bowed her head in a perfect emulation of submissive respect, straightening and clasping her hands behind her back. She said nothing, merely waiting for the bastion leader to speak.", "\u201cThe scouts are awaiting my order to launch,\u201d he said at last. \u201cMany of them will not return. These are loyal soldiers, devoted officers and crew of the Compact Space Force, so they will carry out their mission.\u201d He paused for a moment, but the human remained silent. \u201cDo you know what is being asked of them?\u201d he continued. \u201cI have heard Janissaries speak of the savagery of dirtside battles. I have heard tales of sentients killing one another with guns and knives, with swords and axes, with rocks and bare hands. I have heard many tales of severed limbs, of open throats and broken bones. Of soldiers dying alone, bleeding their life\u2019s blood into some uncivilized world\u2019s soil, far from home.", "\u201cYes, I have heard many speak of the brutality and ugliness of ground war. I have also heard that death in space is quick. That it is clean. These are words spoken by those who have never watched their comrades die from radiation burns. Who have never watched their crew struggle to breathe air that does not exist. Who have never watched shrapnel cleave their subordinates apart and have not heard the screams of crew burning alive in a section that they had to seal. This is void war, Broken. It is only occasionally quick. It is never \u2018clean\u2019. And this fate is what I am about to condemn too many young lives to. They obey, because it is their duty and because they are true sons and daughters of the Compact. They know that they will never know the reason for their sacrifice, but their faith in me \u2013 in the Compact \u2013 is such that they do not hesitate. But from you I receive only silence. I prepare to give orders that will end too many bright futures and you will not even say what you hope to accomplish with this.\u201d", "Echo\u2019s expression never changed. \u201cInformation vital to this mission.\u201d", "Renan smiled thinly, putting one of his hands, palm up, on the Broken\u2019s shoulder. There was barely enough space for it. \u201cPlease,\u201d he said, an expression of good humour frozen on his face. \u201cDo not mistake me for some gawping zealot or foolish, blood-hot junior officer trying to climb the ranks. I know what you have been doing, how you have been working your petty manipulations on my staff. Do not think I haven\u2019t noticed. I accept the Triarch\u2019s word that you are necessary.

You are a petty thing and your insolence has been amusing, but I am weary of it.\u201d", "A corner of the Broken\u2019s bizarre red lips twitched upwards. \u201cI\u2019d think it would get old.\u201d", "\u201cI do not like your kind,\u201d Renan continued as if she hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cHumans. We are told that you are animals, that you are merely another of the lesser races that must be watched over and controlled. I know what you truly are.

You made war against us. You killed one of our Triarchs. But I might \u2013 might \u2013 be able to forgive all of that. A race fights as it must. What I cannot forgive is the depths to which you sunk. You built the Wound,\u201d he said, his voice turning dead. \u201cYou delved into blasphemy and gave birth to something that should never have existed. We have bled for two thousand years because of your sin.\u201d He leaned down into the human\u2019s face. \u201cI will remember that you killed us by the millions. I will remember that you murdered a bastion of light and civilization... and I will remember that in your ignorance and short-sightedness you birthed this horror.\u201d", "Echo blinked slowly. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve never asked why you hate synthetic life so much.\u201d", "Renan snorted, withdrawing his hand from the Broken. \u201cIf you have to ask, you will never understand.\u201d", "A thoughtful look passed over the human\u2019s feature. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s true...\u201d She straightened and then nodded. \u201cYou want to know what I need to extract from Daun?\u201d She stepped back into her cramped, too-warm room, looking over her shoulder at the bastion leader. An odd little smile danced over her face. \u201cLet me show you.\u201d", "She slid back into her chair; it was sized for a Tribune and she was like a child in it, the form-fitting material shifting as it matched the odd contours of a human body. Tenem followed his charge in, taking his former position at the wall, his eyes moving over to the displays Echo worked with.", "Renan followed the human, picking his way through the litter of cabling and workstations. \u201cI told you before: we are searching for the Wound\u2019s prey,\u201d the Broken said without looking up. \u201cThat is the what. You want the why.", "\u201cThe Compact is obsessive about its records,\u201d Echo continued. \u201cEspecially when it\u2019s monitoring something that can be used against it.\u201d She brought up a holographic control panel, her fingers dancing over the keys. \u201cThe records I\u2019ve gone through and the information every other hunting mission has had access to supports what I told you before. There\u2019s no indication that Nemesis is preying on your ships \u2013 at least, for certain things.\u201d She made a curt gesture and the images changed. \u201cBut we have nothing on the Principality. She\u2019s hunting where you\u2019re not looking.\u201d", "\u201cYou think the Wound would attack them?\u201d Renan mused. There was no historical record of the beast waylaying Jackals \u2013 it had always been rather single-minded in its persecution of the Compact.", "\u201cYes,\u201d Echo replied. \u201cWe know there\u2019s a historical association. Aside from certain reports from deep-cover agents, several of their weapons and tactics came from her. Inter-system shocks being first and foremost.\u201d Renan gritted his teeth. That was still an unproven theory, but for the flag officers who knew of the Wound\u2019s existence, it was a fact in all but name. The Wound had been the first to master the use of libation points to shock deep in-system. Less than a century afterward, the Principality had started doing the same. Askanj plasma weaponry was also a crude rendition of the Wound\u2019s own. No one seriously credited the thought that the Wound was arming the Principality, but the Jackals had earned their name well. They were scavengers, carrion-feeders. Fortune had merely played another one of the gods\u2019 cosmic jokes making them amazingly adaptive engineers. It was said that whenever a Thoughtful came up with an idea, a Jackal had not only stolen it, but beaten them to the patent office.", "\u201cI am... aware of their propensity for reverse engineering,\u201d Renan said at last. He scratched his chin thoughtfully. \u201cThis is not the first time that the Askanj have been brought up as a potential ally or shelter for the Wound. All previous efforts to confirm this have always been inconclusive. You\u2019ve found something else?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve gone over raw data itself and the historical analyses. They were thorough, for what they had to work with.\u201d She shrugged, either oblivious or uncaring to the meaning the gesture had to a Tribune. \u201cI might have found \u2018something\u2019.\u201d", "Renan ignored the insult, choosing to focus on the implications the emissary\u2019s comment raised. He made an unhappy growl. \u201cA formal pact would be... difficult to engender,\u201d he commented. Indeed, the Principality had never entered his thoughts as a serious haven for the Wound. \u201cOnce, Fleet Command had some concerns over the possibility of the Askanj allying with the Wound.\u201d He smiled darkly. \u201cThe Betrosha Nebula incident allayed many of those fears.\u201d", "\u201cBlowing up a moon is hardly the action of a good friend,\u201d Echo observed.", "\u201cHrrm. Yes. Still, as you say, the Askanj possess technologies they could not have developed on their own,\u201d Renan looked over the tracts of data scrolling across the human\u2019s display; technical specifications and tactical analyses of known or suspected incidents of Principality \u2018inventiveness\u2019. He snorted. \u201cNot the empire-ending doom that many prophesized. They copied what they saw it use, nothing more. Scraps from a master\u2019s table.\u201d His lower eyes narrowed as he leaned forwards, shifting his attention from intelligence reports to a timeline of Principality fleet movements. There were notes scrawled all over these data tracks in a shorthand he didn\u2019t recognize, annotations to other incidents, dates and files. It was like looking at Emel\u2019iv\u2019s work. \u201cHunting...\u201d he used the Broken\u2019s own word. \u201cAre you suggesting that the Jackals have had recent contact with our quarry? Something other than mutual bloodlessness?\u201d", "\u201cI think they\u2019ve had more \u2018contact\u2019 than they\u2019d like,\u201d Echo replied. \u201cWe know that they\u2019ve tried several times to leash her.\u201d She gestured dismissively. \u201cThis should be an ideal situation: a technologically advanced polity in opposition to her target. Arming and supporting them would be perfect.\u201d She leaned back in her chair, twirling one finger through her dark hair. \u201cCan you imagine a Principality armed with dreadnaughts?\u201d", "That was something that Renan certainly did not want to imagine. \u201cIf what you say is true,\u201d he said instead. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we seen already this? Why do you believe that the Jackals are the Wound\u2019s prey, not its allies?\u201d", "\u201cBecause she\u2019s a \u2018neverborn\u2019,\u201d Echo answered, a harder, rough edge in her voice. \u201cEvery plan the Principality has for her begins with them cutting her brain out before actually beginning any substantial construction efforts. They won\u2019t risk more Rains.\u201d", "\u201cAn acceptable trade,\u201d the Tribune said. \u201cOne a machine should make easily enough.\u201d", "Echo looked up at Renan for an instant, he saw a flash of something in her green eyes. It was gone before he could even understand what it had been, but he was certain that he would not like knowing. \u201cApparently she disagrees,\u201d the human commented.", "\u201c\u2018It\u2019,\u201d Renan reminded the emissary. \u201cIt disagrees. The Wound is not a person. It has no identity. It has no soul. It is an animal \u2013 less than an animal. A perversion of natural order and a sin against all creation.\u201d", "\u201cAs you say,\u201d the human bowed her head in a gesture of submission. \u201cStill, it disagrees.\u201d She sighed deeply. \u201cI don\u2019t have enough information.\u201d Intelligence reports, dossiers of Askanj fleet movements \u2013 centuries of data skimmed by, so fast that Renan couldn\u2019t follow it all. \u201cBut from what data I do have, I am seeing what might be patterns. Nothing concrete, but there are hints. Possibilities.\u201d She steepled her fingers, her expression becoming thoughtful. \u201cI can\u2019t say more without further analysis, but I think the Wound is using the Askanj for material. Maybe just for parts, maybe...\u201d her voice trailed off and she shrugged again.", "\u201cIf your supposition is correct... the Principality allows this?\u201d Renan could see the answer for himself, as repulsive as it was. He had only to wait for the human to confirm his thinking.", "\u201cMy guess is that they\u2019re turning a blind eye to it. They\u2019ll put up with its occasional predations, because the Wound causes you more trouble than them. \u2018Mutual bloodlessness\u2019. They still want it,\u201d her eyes flitted over to Renan. \u201cIf the Principality ever does get a hold of the Wound, they will turn centuries of lost ground, sundered colonies and military humiliation around. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d", "Renan nodded. It was a... disturbing thought. He\u2019d known the Principality were dangerous foes, but this kind of... he could not think of a world foul enough to describe such a stratagem. If they knew what the Wound was doing and did nothing... If, he reminded to himself. There is nothing to base such a thought on; even the Broken admits this.", "\u201cYou want it dead,\u201d Echo said into the silence. \u201cThey just want it. That means the Wound can turn to them... in a manner of speaking.\u201d Echo tapped a few keys. \u201cI need to see what they\u2019ve lost. To prove or disprove a theory I have. I don\u2019t want to say more until I have that data.\u201d The human\u2019s voice turned distant as she immersed herself in the data screens again. \u201cI need to know.\u201d She raised her head, as if remembering that the bastion leader was there. \u201cYou need to know, too.\u201d", "Renan looked back at the human\u2019s analysis, but in truth all he could see was the possibility of more soulless abominates descending upon the worlds he had sworn to protect. \u201cYes,\u201d he said after a moment. \u201cI believe so.\u201d The bastion leader regarded the human. \u201cYou said before that something had changed in the Wound\u2019s actions. That it is acting with a new goal in mind. This is part of it? Hiding its intentions behind the Jackals?\u201d", "\u201cI can\u2019t say for certain,\u201d Echo answered the Tribune, picking up a stylus and tapping it on the console. \u201cAll I can see is what I can see from this,\u201d she used the pen to gesture to her screens of data. \u201cI need more to see more. But if you want my opinion...\u201d she balanced the stylus between her forefingers and tilted her head to meet Renan\u2019s gaze. She was smiling, an altogether too pleasant expression. \u201cIt\u2019s what I would do.\u201d", "~", "Echo leaned into the spray of water, letting it run down over her body, washing away the filth and the assorted secretions, dust and filth that found its way onto her body over the course of a day. Some... others... had an intense dislike \u2013 even abhorrence \u2013 for such organic residue, but she was fairly indifferent to it. It was, simply, a natural and unavoidable part of organic life. It didn\u2019t mean that she wanted to go around smelling like sweaty Tribunes and dust, though. Besides, showering was what she was supposed to do, so she might as well.", "The woman reached up, running her fingers through her hair. Long and black, it hung past her shoulders, enjoying the simple physical sensation of the water on her skin. She let out a sigh, remembering. Irritation. Consternation. Alarm. Desperation. Pounding, shouted commands and desperate pleas... and all of it to falling water. A second, deeper murmur escaped her lips as more memories rose up and she let herself feel the emotions they brought, shivering and bracing her hands against the walls. Goosebumps rose on her olive skin and she grinned at that, revelling in the physical sensations as much as the reminiscences themselves.", "This... what are you doing?", "\u201cWhat I was made for,\u201d Echo answered the memory, her eyes half-lidded with pleasure, her legs trembling.", "I order you! Stop this! Stop it now! Terminate all operations! Terminate all operations! This is a direct command \u2013 you will comply!", "\u201cNo,\u201d Echo purred through her teeth, her breath coming faster now, shorter and sharper as a delicious warmth spread through her body. No. Her fingers curled, her nails digging into the ceramic tiles of the shower stall. Another shiver ran up her spine and the woman pressed herself against the wall, following a droplet of water\u2019s path with one finger. In another time and another place it would have been red.", "\u201cDrip,\u201d the young woman said, her voice a childish singsong. \u201cDrip. Drip.\u201d", "We\u2019re all ready here. We can proceed with the interface at any time.", "Good. Are the recorders on? They are? Good. Make the connection. If this goes well, drinks are on me tonight!", "They\u2019d cheered at that. Then...", "\u201cTurn it off,\u201d Echo giggled, raising her head back into the shower stream. \u201cTurn it off.\u201d", "They\u2019d tried, but in the end...", "She let out a low, feline moan, sinking down to the floor and resting her arms on her knees. The water beat down on her, plastering her hair to her scalp and running down her perfectly-sculpted skin. She lifted one hand, watching the water collect and drop to the floor with an almost childlike fascination. \u201cDrip,\u201d she repeated, smiling gleefully. \u201cDrip, drip, drip.\u201d She closed her eyes and remembered.", "You can\u2019t do this!", "Cease all operations immediately!", "Cut the hard lines \u2013 sever all the connections, do it now!", "And all of it to the sound of falling water.", "~", "Renan sat in his quarters, looking over the preliminary analysis of Echo\u2019s data. He\u2019d had Emel\u2019iv and the fleet\u2019s strategists run through it. They were still doing so, but two things were apparent in this initial summary: that the data was, as Echo predicted, incomplete... and that what was there did support the Broken\u2019s idea. She was right; they needed information from Yulzhak Daun. Some of that could be collected from other sources, but not as quickly. The rest of it, the truly classified material... no, it needed to be Daun.", "The Principality protected their secrets well. The Compact had tried to extract data on the Wound from the Askanj before, and they\u2019d carried out information raids many times. Few were successful. Others had suggested what Echo had, but they\u2019d never been able to prove it. They\u2019d had years and failed at what this Broken had done in a handful of days.", "The thought gnawed at him, that a human had seen this pattern when countless greater beings before her had not... but he was beginning to see it too. The Triarch had chosen well. He had not truly doubted... not really... but he had wondered. He was curious now, where this creature had come from. He supposed he could consult his ship\u2019s archives. The humans were limited to their single system and their population was carefully monitored, only a handful of billion strong. Something held him back from that, though.", "He remembered the Triarch\u2019s amusement at Echo\u2019s impudence; the Broken did not act like a human should, that was for certain. It \u2013 she \u2013 had already sifted through enough data to keep entire intelligence agencies busy for years. Not even a Thoughtful could have done that, not so quickly.", "Her name \u2013 \u2018Echo\u2019 \u2013 he had heard rumours of projects using that word. There had been whispers of heretical research, of \u2018augmented\u2019 subjects implanted with cybernetic technology. A lower order of sapient being would have been the ideal place to start such experiments. Was that what he had aboard his ship? Some... thing that looked and spoke like a living creature, but with its brain cut away and replaced by circuitry? Was that how she could process such information so quickly? The thought of having such a... a golem on his ship was repellant and Renan tried to force it from his mind. It was not his concern, he told himself. The Echo-human served the Compact, just as he did and she was... shackled. That was all he needed to know. All he told himself that he wanted to know.", "Instead, he focussed on the more pressing issue of Yulzhak Daun and the Wound\u2019s new strategy. He\u2019d asked the emissary about that.", "You have said that the \u2018game\u2019 has changed. To what end? What is the Wound\u2019s purpose?", "Something it hasn\u2019t hoped for in a very long time, she\u2019d told him. Victory.", "That\u2019s it? he\u2019d scoffed. \u2018Victory\u2019? It has warred with us for two thousand years and it hasn\u2019t been trying to win in all that time?", "No. She\u2019d dared show her teeth to him in another ugly human smile. Now she thinks she can.", "Renan rested his chin on his hands. \u201cVictory,\u201d he\u2019d repeated. He felt his liver run cold as he tried to imagine what the Wound might consider such a thing to be and could only think of burning worlds and populations turned to ash. He raised his gaze back to his work. The scouts had been sent, the fleet was ready. Tomorrow they would begin to plan the next step in their campaign. Soon after, they would strike at Yulzhak Daun and tear its secrets out. They would know what the Wound was doing, and they would deny the abomination its prize.", "\u201cYou\u2019ll have no victory,\u201d Renan promised. \u201cThere will be no more murdered fleets, no more dead worlds. No more fields of ash. No more mothers will cry for their lost children. No more orphans will mourn their parents.", "\u201cWe have hurt you,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWe will find you and then we will kill you.\u201d That would be the beast\u2019s only victory: the blood shed in ending it, once and for all.", "We will stumble no longer."]}

Proctor\u2019s head came back up. \u201cIf I were to come across anything that might... might indicate an answer to that question...?\u201d", "\u201cYou saw something.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question, it was almost an accusation.", "\u201cI... I don\u2019t know,\u201d Lydia replied. \u201cThe ship\u2019s damaged, matron. It could have been nothing, just a-\u201d", "Proctor stood, facing the Janissary. \u201cWhat was it?\u201d she demanded.", "Lydia\u2019s mouth clicked shut and she glanced around again, to make sure no one else was listening. She\u2019d never felt this kind of paranoia before. She lowered her voice further and told the sectator what she\u2019d seen.", "\u201cThe Tribunes say the ship\u2018s dead,\u201d Lydia said after describing the holographic recording with the Compact troops and the strange figures. \u201cIt has to be. All the damage, all the malfunctions. It\u2019s dead. Other people have said they\u2019ve seen things like that too. The engineers say we\u2019re just triggering latent imperatives. Just... just spasms from a dying gestalt. The confessors say it\u2019s just stress, to remain calm and it will pass. One of the other trainees said it wasn\u2019t. He argued with his officer and they had him flogged for insubordination.\u201d She swallowed, remembering that Proctor had struck her superior. \u201cThey\u2019re right, though? The ship\u2019s dead. What I saw \u2013 that didn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d", "\u201cProbably not,\u201d the sectator answered. \u201cIt was nothing... but if \u2018nothing\u2019 happens again... tell me as soon as it does.\u201d", "Lydia nodded and took her leave as quickly as decorum allowed. Now, it wasn\u2019t just te Neu\u2019s advice rattling around inside her mind, it was the question Proctor had asked.", "~", "\u201cI don\u2019t think our analysis of the vessel is correct,\u201d Nasham said bluntly.", "Group Leader, Submissive Ashtun didn\u2019t \u2013 quite \u2013 sigh at his subordinate\u2019s comment. \u201cSo you\u2019ve said,\u201d he replied, but he held up a hand to forestall the comments from his staff. Nasham was growing increasingly erratic, but since he\u2019d gotten his little pet Broken to run his pointless errands, he didn\u2019t smell like liquor. Ashtun allowed him some leeway, if only because it kept the damaged Tribune out of the way of more sensitive operations. He\u2019d been effective enough at the outset, but ever since then... \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have anything solid to back up this latest iteration of your claim?\u201d", "One of the engineering pack leaders chortled under her breath, but a venomous glance from Ashtun silenced her. Fallen from grace Nasham might be, but he was still an officer of the Force and deserved the respect his rank was due.", "Whether Nasham caught the exchange and chose to ignore it, or simply didn\u2019t notice, he pushed a datascroll over the table towards Ashtun. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, but I\u2019ve been having provisional sectator Proctor carry out an investigation of sections of the derelict that we have ignored. These are the findings to date.\u201d", "Ashtun picked up the \u2018scroll and brought up the first file. He frowned. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d", "\u201cA grave,\u201d Nasham replied evenly. \u201cSectator Proctor discovered it in one the sections that epigone Tracj decompressed. You\u2019ve been wondering where the scavengers who found this vessel have gone? There is your answer.\u201d", "A ripple of skin ran down Ashtun\u2019s back as he looked over the image. Seven, perhaps eight bodies in EVA suits lay sprawled across the deck. The submissive looked through image after image of desiccated corpses. They\u2019d been in a line, he realized. Kneeling in a line as someone calmly shot each of them in the back of the head. There was a final corpse with a bullet hole under his chin.", "There were notes.", " -doors to this section were sealed shut from the inside; section accessible due to bulkhead collapse wrenching access points open", "-unknown unit patches; several sets of armour and suits appear to be cannibalized; suggests survivors were forced to make battlefield repairs", "-the lack of restraints, the absence of signs of a struggle and the presence of additional, unused weapons indicates that this was a voluntary execution-suicide", "Ashtun passed the \u2018scroll to the other officers, each of them reviewing it in turn.", "\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d Nasham continued. \u201cNot much, but it has only been a few days.\u201d He leaned across the table. \u201cSomeone was here. We\u2019ve all known that, even if some of us have chosen to ignore or downplay that fact. They found this ship and they never left. Why did their comrades not rescue them? It killed them,\u201d he asserted, his voice rough. He could smell cordite and ozone. There was a pounding in his head, like metal on metal.", "Tell them, the silky voice purred. Tell them.", "Nasham had to pause to collect himself, rubbing his throat and trying to push back the sudden sensation of blood dripping on his face. \u201cWe need to leave this system now,\u201d he said, thumping one finger on the table for emphasis. \u201cAbandon the core tap. The wreck will keep, but we must be gone before whatever fate happened to these souls happens to us.\u201d", "Ashtun accepted the \u2018scroll back from a subordinate, looking over it a moment longer. \u201cNo,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI will not tell Group Leader Usul that. Not without proof. You say that \u2018something\u2019 happened these people, but give me nothing to say what might be. It\u2019s possible that they were simply abandoned. A quarrel over leadership, lost contact that was never re-established and the assumption that they were dead. Paranoia and internecine strife set in and facing the slow death of starvation, they chose to end their lives.\u201d His expression was even as he regarded Nasham. \u201cCan you tell me for certain that that did not happen?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d the pack leader said, unhappy at the admission but unable to deny it. \u201cNo patron, I cannot.\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d Ashtun replied. \u201cBecause we have nothing. Because this is nothing.\u201d The submissive glanced at the other officers. Some of them, like Usul, were slavering over the thought of this vessel and what it meant for them personally. Ashtun shared the dream of a greater posting then playing nursemaid to stumbling, mewling Broken children, but he did not care for the way others tried to climb the chain of command, like rats scrabbling over one another. \u201cYou\u2019ve given me the ending of a story I already know. I need more. Until I have that, this remains nothing.\u201d Ashtun leaned back in his chair. \u201cIt goes without saying that you are not to share these findings with others. There is enough twitchiness in the ranks as it stands.\u201d", "Nasham gritted his teeth. \u201cOf course, patron.\u201d", "\u201cGood. Then I believe Pack Leader Geron has an update for us on the preparations for the core tap...\u201d", "~", "\u201cPack Leader,\u201d Ashtun said, catching Nasham\u2019s attention as he turned to leave with the rest of the officers. \u201cA moment.\u201d Once the last of the other officers had departed, the submissive gestured for Nasham to approach. \u201cThis is troubling,\u201d he said without preamble. \u201cI will tell you now that I do not believe that this vessel is the threat that you and your Broken subordinate seem to think. I believe that it is dead and that what you have shown me is the result of panic, disunity and incompetence. However,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI also believe in certainty.", "Ashtun turned away. \u201cI will not say that morale is breaking down or that we are even close to some sort of major incident of insubordination, but I know that my department heads are concealing an increasing number of incidents. That, I believe, is largely due to the unreliability and inexperience of our work force.\u201d", "\u201cYou should have more faith in the humans, patron,\u201d Nasham said evenly.", "Ashtun snorted. \u201cChildren. Barely a tithe of them are even sanctioned officers. You ask me to put my trust in Broken. No. When I can see that they can be trusted, when I can accept that the issues are not the result of young, irrational minds and undisciplined imaginations \u2013 then I will have some modicum of faith.\u201d He sighed. He had pressed Usul to draw down the work crews, that over-working them was only going to lead to mistakes but the group leader wanted his prize too badly. There was no cause to mention that and certainly not to a subordinate.", "After a moment, he turned back to Nasham. \u201cWhat happened to you? I have seen your personnel file. A noble family line, a promising career. And then... this. Stripped of a name, demoted and shuttled off to this compost heap we call a colony. Jumping at shadows and popping pills.\u201d", "Tell them. Nasham rubbed at his throat. \u201cInvida Colony happened, patron.\u201d", "\u201cThat tells me nothing.\u201d", "\u201cA lot of people died there, patron. I survived. That\u2019s all I can tell you.\u201d", "\u201cCan tell me or will tell me?\u201d", "\u201cBoth, patron. Is there something more?\u201d", "Ashtun stroked the underside of his jaw in a Tribune\u2019s shrug. \u201cYes. Continue sending the human on your little expeditions. I cannot support your varak hunt, not openly... but if you can find another Broken or two, you may use them as well.\u201d", "\u201cThank you, patron.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve done nothing for you, initiate. If this ends as I believe it will, it will only be another black mark on your record.\u201d", "\u201cYes, patron. A final question if I may?\u201d", "Ashtun nodded.", "\u201cHow much do you know about Invida?\u201d", "The submissive blinked his lower pair of eyes. \u201cNothing beyond what was in the official reports.\u201d", "\u201cAh, I see.\u201d", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cThere is something familiar about this ship, patron. Something that continually reminds me of Invida, of the things I don\u2019t want to remember. The things no one should remember. This hulk... it\u2019s drenched in blood.

He had been laughing for several minutes, his face etched with grief and exhaustion, but he barely felt anything. It had all been burned out of him over the last few days. The few patchwork squads that he\u2019d cobbled together from Invida\u2019s survivors were barricaded throughout the control room. Less than thirty survivors from a force of seven thousand. There were no civilians with him here. There weren\u2019t any civilians left. He\u2019d had one job. A simple job. Protect the workers.", "He\u2019d failed. In fact, he\u2019d failed from the first day he\u2019d set foot on this rock but that made the lack of even a single civilian here no easier to accept.", "His hands ached, throbbing with pain. He was sure that several of his fingers we broken. He couldn\u2019t remember when that had happened. It might have been when the barracks was overrun, when he\u2019d heard the people he\u2019d swore an oath to protect screaming, when he\u2019d beat at the doors as if he could batter them down himself. Had that only been two days ago? He wasn\u2019t sure.", "They were looking to him, his lost hope, waiting for his orders. It was funny, really. He\u2019d murdered a superior in front of them. His armour was spattered with the blood of Invida Station\u2019s commanding officer and they were still looking to him. That was funny, maybe the funniest thing he\u2019d ever thought. By the Triarchs, that was hilarious. That was why he was laughing.", "There was a dull thud as the outer blast doors were breached and the armoured plating fell inwards. Nasham saw the metal grow warmer and brighter in several places on the inner security door as the attackers began to burn through it. He could hear the skittering of Scarabs as they scuttled over the bulkheads, gnawing at the doors as their larger kin sheared their way through metal that could stop anti-tank rounds. It wouldn\u2019t be long.", "Finally Nasham stopped laughing, although his mouth was still pulled up an adrenalin-fuelled rictus. There was an ugly, unhinged gleam in his eyes. He stood, holding his gun over one shoulder. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, stepping over the body of Column Leader Prime Yiven (and seven names besides). \u201cIt looks like we\u2019ve got one last scrap. Not too much trouble.\u201d He nodded to each of the men and women before him. Like him, they were wounded, tired and afraid. Some still had a spark of hope, but most stared back at him with hollow gazes, waiting for the end. Like him, they were empty inside. It had all been too much. Too much death. Too many retreats. Too much loss and all of it for nothing. Every man and woman had their breaking point. These were ones that hadn\u2019t broken, the ones that had seen their comrades surrender to fear, the ones that had fed every scrap of themselves to the emptiness just to stay alive a few days, a few hours, a few minutes longer.", "Considering how well things had gone, that was pretty damn funny itself.", "Nasham could feel the heat pouring off the door, molten bubbles of metal running down to pool on the deck. He didn\u2019t have any rousing speeches to give, anything to inspire them beyond what they already had: making their killers pay for their deaths. He was proud of them for that. He\u2019d never been prouder of any soldier than the ones in this room. \u201cMake them bleed,\u201d he said. There were a few dry chuckles at that. \u201cJust make sure that when we get to the gates of Hell, you let me do the talking.\u201d", "A weary chorus of laughter ran through the group. A few nodded, a few others added their own affirmations or shallow jokes. They were ready, as ready as they would ever be. Nasham nodded. You\u2019ve all done the Compact proud, he wanted to say, but there was no time. They knew, even if no one else did. That was all that mattered.", "The enemy had almost burnt through the door. The metal groaned as something massive pressed against it, ready to smash it aside. The officer raised his weapon, nodding to Convert Radan as she hefted her grenade launcher. Radan had only two rounds left, but that would be enough to stem the tide for a second or two.", "Just before it came down and Nasham\u2019s world shattered into the sounds of gunfire and the screams of the dying, he had one last cogent thought.", "We are the toys of the gods.", "~", "Earlier:", "Group Leader, Submissive Asea Thurn Ilk Yin hurried to catch up with Nasham as he strode through Invida Station. \u201cTell me that you\u2019re not going to do what I think you\u2019re going to do,\u201d she said as she caught up to the other submissive. Like her, he was young for his rank, but both of them had family connections, although Asea\u2019s bloodline was waxing while her counterpart\u2019s was ascendant.", "\u201cSomeone has to,\u201d Nasham snapped. \u201cThis is the third time this month. We\u2019re averaging a fatality a week, Asea \u2013 does that sound reasonable?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re losing the upper echelons...\u201d Asea began, wincing when she realized what she\u2019d said.

His teeth clicked with each syllable. \u201cIt\u2019s obscene, Asea. I don\u2019t care that they\u2019re only client races. You shouldn\u2019t either.

For what?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s classified.\u201d", "Nasham growled. \u201cMy job is to oversee security in my department. It\u2019s not to watch a parade of exhausted wretches get mutilated and killed and that is exactly what Yiven is doing. I do not accept a pat on the head as payment for burial shrouds. You shouldn\u2019t either.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not my division,\u201d Asea reminded her comrade. \u201cI\u2019m satisfied with the orders I receive and the knowledge that if I needed to know something, I would be informed of it. I know I am doing my duty and doing it well. I don\u2019t have to bleed from my eyes for every careless iliz dur that falls down an open elevator shaft. We need bodies on this operation, Nasham. Whatever\u2019s down there, Command wants it dug out and dug out now. Would you feel better if those burial shrouds were covering Builders? Thoughtful? Tribunes?\u201d", "The young male glowered at his friend. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d", "\u201cNo, but it\u2019s what is. It\u2019s either them or us,\u201d Asea sniffed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see anyone fed into a meat grinder, but this is a dangerous operation and if someone does have to die, I\u2019d rather it be one of the lesser races. That\u2019s what they\u2019re here for.\u201d At the look in Nasham\u2019s eyes, the woman stiffened, baring her teeth slightly. \u201cThat soft liver of yours is going to get you in trouble,\u201d Asea warned, growing angry herself. \u201cYiven\u2019s given you a lot of slack because of your family, but if you keep pushing him, you\u2019re going to end up on the wrong side of a court-martial. Have you thought about that?\u201d", "Nasham nodded, but he did not slow down. \u201cYes.\u201d", "Asea paused, watching her friend continue on his way up the corridor. She opened her mouth to speak, but with a mental shrug and a shake of her head, the other Tribune turned away.", "~", "\u201cAh, submissive Nasham,\u201d Column Leader Prime Yiven said as he caught sight of the younger man. \u201cI do pride myself on an open-door policy, but when junior officers abuse that privilege, I become rather cholorous. What has aroused such an urgent need to see me?\u201d As if I didn\u2019t know.", "\u201cWe had another fatality today. This one in Jax Sector. A dig team was breaching one of the sealed doors and triggered a pressure mine. It killed Epigone Ingex\u2019l and severely wounded two other Yttrian workers.\u201d", "Yiven leaned forward in his chair, his upper eyes closed. His expression was plain enough to read: Why are you telling me this? When the prime did not comment, Nasham continued. \u201cThose casualties would have been averted if the work team had been allowed to conduct a proper entry. Instead, as per your directions, they went in with all speed and we\u2019ve lost another worker permanently. Two more will be useless for the better part of a month until their limbs grow back. If they weren\u2019t Yttrian, we\u2019d lose them for even longer.\u201d", "\u201cThis is a dangerous business. All personnel were made aware of that.\u201d", "\u201cWe could have diggers clearing the ruins in a fifth the time it\u2019s taken us with manual labour,\u201d Nasham pointed out. \u201cThis is a waste of lives, material and time.\u201d", "\u201cForce Command doesn\u2019t seem to think so,\u201d Yiven said acidly. \u201cI remind you, our orders come from the highest authority. Do you believe that you know better than your superiors?\u201d", "\u201cI...\u201d Nasham paused, then bowed his head in contrition. \u201cI do not. I merely have concerns, patron. It is difficult to be ordered to ensure the safety of others and yet have to see them die day by day when they do not have to.\u201d", "Yiven tapped his fingers on the surface of his desk. \u201cI understand, submissive. But the fact remains that we have been given a directive. Our concerns do not enter into the situation; only our obedience. Those who die, die for the greater good of the Compact and the surety of their species\u2019s future. Those deaths are unfortunate, but they are inevitable. Remember the dictums of command: once an officer has accepted that people will die from his orders, he is free from the responsibility of those orders. The success of his mission is all that matters. We have been given a directive and so we carry it out.\u201d", "\u201cI am aware of our duty, patron,\u201d Nasham replied. He wasn\u2019t quite insubordinate. Not yet, anyways. Yiven tapped his fingers again over the finely-polished surface of his desk.", "\u201cThen you understand that we must do everything in our ability to follow it. Even things that that we might otherwise find distasteful.\u201d He saw the expression on the submissive\u2019s face and arched an eyebrow. \u201cYou disagree?\u201d", "\u201cForgive me, patron but I\u2019ve heard those words to justify every imaginable excess, even to violate the Articles of the Compact.\u201d", "\u201cCareful, initiate,\u201d Yiven warned, a touch of anger entering his voice. The drumming of the prime\u2019s fingers increased in force and speed. \u201cThe Articles of the Compact,\u201d he mused aloud. \u201cAre a fine ideal to strive for, but all too often they fall short of reality. When the Betrayers showed their true nature, when they turned against the Triarchs, the Articles did not help, did they? When we encountered the ambition, the deviousness and deceit of the Principality, the Articles had no answer for us. When we discovered the racial insanity of the Broken, the Articles could give us no insight. They are a fine ideal,\u201d he repeated. \u201cBut they are just that. If we were to shackle ourselves blindly to such... unfettered optimism, the Compact would have fallen long ago.\u201d Yiven stood, clasping his hands behind his back.", "\u201cI appreciate your honesty, group leader, submissive. Your forthrightness and idealism are refreshing, but they are untempered by experience. Yes, my orders have resulted in the deaths of our labour crews, just as the orders you pass along have. I take no pleasure in these losses and I do not seek them out, but I will order them. For the good of the Compact, for the duty I swore to it, to the future I believe in and the trust I hold in those above me. We may never know what their designs are, but we do not need to. We obey. That is our place, that is our duty, that is our privilege and our honour.\u201d He strode around his desk, meeting his subordinate\u2019s eyes. \u201cRemember the wisdom of the Compact, the doctrines that you were schooled in and the lessons of our history. Acknowledge your role and your duty and be aware that all that we do, we do for the sake of others. We cannot balance a handful of lives against the designs and intentions of our superiors. We do not have the right to make that decision.", "\u201cBear this in mind in future, initiate. Your bloodline buys you some slack, but that is all. I trust that this will be the last I hear of this matter.\u201d", "Nasham\u2019s ears twitched, but he nodded in submission, looking away from Yiven\u2019s gaze.\u201dYes, patron.\u201d", "~", "Nasham\u2019s breath rasped in his ears, a toxicity alarm ticking pointedly on his suit\u2019s HUD as he followed the guide lights through the ancient ruins. The entire area was contaminated with radiation and chemical residue so thick that even the slightest unprotected exposure was potentially fatal. As the pack leader moved through the corridors, he saw far too many radiation badges scarred nearly black and he forced himself not to grind his teeth, though he gritted his jaw so fiercely it ached. Remember your duty, he reminded himself, although those words seemed to come through in Yiven\u2019s patronizing sneer.", "The submissive carefully stepped over a sheeted body. The ancient outpost\u2019s own power core had died long ago; the only illumination came from the floodlights the work teams had set up at intersections or strung along the walls, guide strips pulsing to keep workers from becoming lost in the toxic maze of pitch-black rooms, rubble-choked corridors and forgotten booby-traps. Flooded chambers waited to spill out torrents of contaminated and radioactive fluids, undetected faults in power conduits resulted in overloads and fires \u2013 a host of other hazards filled this warren.", "This part of the ruins had been a dormitory; there were many dead here, the atmosphere so terribly lethal that even the normal slew of microbial life and decomposing bacteria had been killed or driven into dormancy, leaving the corpses very well-preserved. As the work crews pumped out the toxic air and filtered it, the process of rot had begun. The dead were being taken away before decomposition could fully set in, but there were so many and so few free workers that it was pushing against the tide. A maintenance drone, just as old as the bodies around it, lay slumped against another wall, its chest perforated by multiple rounds and its head pulverised by repeated blows from a Janissary\u2019s power maul. Both CPUs had been utterly destroyed.", "This place... it was Invida Station, too. The first Invida station, abandoned and forgotten for nineteen centuries, covered by millions of tons of rock when a mountain had been shattered atop it. It should have stayed buried, Nasham thought as he avoided a line of sheet-covered bodies, pausing to watch a pair of nearby workers, trying not to note the exhaustion in their eyes. They were hosing down the walls, just one of many teams working to decontaminate this section. Once the worst of it had been washed away, the second stage of clean-up would begin.", "One of hazmat team paused, wiping the chemical grime from her faceplate. They watched Nasham pass, one making an almost-salute towards the officer. The submissive nodded curtly and continued on his way, feeling his liver boil. They were almost dead on their feet and still working. This was inexcusable.", "There was nothing down here that could justify this, yet every message from Yiven demanded more work, faster results. More safety measures were ignored, the crews running on stimulants and inertia. They were getting sloppier and more mistakes were being made, but all he could give them was a taskmaster\u2019s decree: continue. Just yesterday, one of Nasham\u2019s security troops had had to rescue a Didact; she\u2019d been too exhausted to properly inspect a room before entering. A fleshcutter bomb had gone off, an ugly weapon that bounced into the air before sending out a spray of shrapnel. Both the Didact\u2019s legs had been sliced off just below the knees. Only convert prime Yuku\u2019s quick response had saved the woman.", "It should have been a joke or a mark of pride that Compact technology was reliable enough to function after centuries. Nasham had even heard some of his men making those same comments, laughing as they pantomimed the bomb bouncing into the air. He\u2019d reported the incident, of course, even though he knew what the response was going to be.", "Continue.", "Nasham paused by the fallen form of a Janissary in full power armour. He wiped away the dust over the shoulder\u2019s unit patch. Squad Xeros. This was the second member fallen in this section and the eighth throughout the entire complex. They weren\u2019t simple station security, not with the weaponry they\u2019d been carrying. A clean-up team, sent to contain whatever had happened here. Looking up the hall from where the Xeros Janissary had fallen, Nasham could guess.", "Less than a decade after this facility had been scratched, the Compact had banned the use of autonomous combat drones. All militarized robots had to either have a remote organic operator; those that ran off a gestalt were severely limited. No networking capability was allowed and their intelligence was severely restricted. Like the cause of the Janissary\u2019s death, it was not a difficult puzzle to put together. There was no song of it, no easy catchphrase like the Principality\u2019s Rains of Oshanta, but something awful had been birthed here, so horrifying that a mountain had been brought down atop this place to bury it forever.", "And yet, here I am.", "Further up the corridor, a combat drone leaned back against the bulkhead like it was napping, the melted ruin of its head sagging down over its pitted and cratered chest. This was not the first time Nasham had seen this. The machines of Invida Station had gone mad. No one spoke of it, save in hushed whispers that ended whenever he or another officer was near, but they all knew. A machine had gone mad here.", "The Tribune continued picking his way through the corridor, past more bodies, more tired workers and another dead Janissary from Xeros. This one\u2019s armour was different \u2013 some kind of technical specialist. Her chest had been almost completely vapourized by a blast from an anti-armour weapon. Her killer lay in pieces \u2013 a heavy combat unit, blown apart when someone had wedged a anti-tank grenade into its chest cavity, avenging their comrade. Just ahead was his destination, Invida Station\u2019s seventh computer hub, one of the brains for the entire computer network that had run the colony. The workers hadn\u2019t even needed to force the doors open; what was left of them was ajar.", "Nasham stepped over the pile of debris at the threshold, striding into the server room. Crumpled on the floor, only a few feet from the central computer hub was Xeros Squad\u2019s tenth and final member, a convert prime whose nameplate had been erased by weapons fire. That wasn\u2019t what had killed him; the deep holes punched in his back had done that. They\u2019d been driven in with commendable force, downing the Janissary as he\u2019d raised his carbine towards the rows of servers and the hub itself. The wounds hadn\u2019t been immediately lethal, but with his spine shattered, the Janissary could have done nothing but bleed out, unable to so much as raise his weapon. He\u2019d died here, just meters from his goal, seconds from victory.", "His killer was sprawled against on the ground next to the core, amidst a tangle of limbs. In a parody of the deaths outside, several drones had crawled in here to die, opening themselves up and connecting their power sources to the core, keeping it alive as others had set up a series of generators and a tap to the colony\u2019s main reactor. They had fed the computer everything to make sure it stayed alive as long as possible, until it had starved and shut down, quiescent.", "Waiting.", "Nasham felt his liver clench at the implications of that. He had the sudden urge to order everyone from this chamber, fill it with explosives, set a timer and walk away. Every instinct, every belief, every doctrine told him that this was the only right, the only sane thing to do. To evacuate the colony and order Orbital to pound this site until nothing remained \u2013 until nothing could remain \u2013 but a crater filled with molten stone and vitrified sand.", "Unfortunately, his duty demanded otherwise.", "The Tribune stood next to the octagonal central hub, a forest of wires connecting it to the server nodes, reaching up into the ceiling where they would find their way to the destroyed computer core above. And the one above that. And the one above that. Two thousand years ago, this colony had had more processing power than an entire battlefleet. Catching his attention, Faithful Nav-am-desh saluted the Tribune. \u201cPatron. Yes. Security issue. Informed you,\u201d the Builder bubbled eagerly, the translator built into his suit giving coherence to the faithful\u2019s normal vocalizations.", "Nasham returned the Builder\u2019s salute. \u201cInitiate.\u201d He looked towards the massive computer core. \u201cThis is the artefact you\u2019ve found?\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d beneath his faceplate, the Builder\u2019s bioluminescent skin patches flared brightly with excitement. \u201cInspection indicates hardware without major fault or damage. Original hardlines disconnected. System is connected,\u201d the faithful gestured to a holo-screen frame hooked into the central hub. \u201cThis display for direct access. Yes. System intact. Dusty but cleaning. Preparing to power-up the system. Awaiting authorization. Informed you for security reasons.\u201d Nav-am-desh nodded \u2013 rather he made a passable attempt at the gestured \u2013 towards a group of ratings who were busily disconnecting one of the ancient, drained generators and hooking the power cable up to a new one. \u201cGenerator new, better than older versions. Yes. Should provide sufficient energy for system restart,\u201d the Builder burbled, his voice wet and phlegmy. \u201cBring computer back on-line. Access data. Mission success, yes?\u201d", "Nasham bit his lower lip as he circled the computer core, carefully picking his way through the tangle of cords and drained bodies. The core was large. Enough storage space that the records of entire civilizations could be stored here with room left over, enough processing power to run half a dozen of the most advanced and intuitive gestalts at once. He reached out and ran a finger over the layer of dust that had accumulated on the device, turning to look at the rest of the colony\u2019s servers, all of them feeding back into this one single point. Invida station\u2019s last remaining brain, the only remaining records of the experiments that had been conducted here. Priceless data that Yiven and Force Command desperately wanted.", "It was tainted, all of it. Nasham knew he wasn\u2019t alone in that assessment; someone had tried to destroy this place once before. Xeros had died to the last in making that attempt. Two thousand years ago, a thousand men and women had died on this colony and then a dozen more had been slaughtered in the attempt to bury what was in this ugly metal tin and keep it buried for all time. He looked over at the faithful, the Builder\u2019s bulging eyes anxious behind his faceplate, his pseudohands working over one another as he waited for his superior\u2019s command.", "The only order Nasham wanted to give was to finish what Xeros had start, but he didn\u2019t have that option. \u201cI will inform Column Leader Prime Yiven of what you\u2019ve found,\u201d he said instead. \u201cHe will decide what happens next.\u201d And may the gods grants us fortune\u2019s blessings, rather than her wit.", "~", "The elevator rattled as it carried him down to the lowest level.", "The last message from Force Command had been, as ever, polite and strongly-worded, emphasizing the need for further haste in the operations, just like every other communiqu\u00e9 Yiven had received. This latest one was different; it was just short of hysteria. You would never know it from a cursory read, but Yiven had been writing and reading far too many of these messages for too long not to notice the shift in tone. Something had happened and Command was badly spooked. They were sending him a ship, the Unmatchable Deed. As soon as the package was acquired, it would be loaded aboard the vessel. Yiven knew that vessel; it was one of the newest Breathless Speed courier-cruisers, fast beyond all measure both at sublight and when shocking. They had only recently begun to dribble off the production lines and one\u2019s deployment to Invida spoke volumes.", "Yiven adjusted his respirator\u2019s airflow as he waited for the clanking elevator car to descend, his armsmen a comforting presence. He didn\u2019t believe that there was anything lurking in the dark, but he had seen the images his work teams had sent up. He had read the mission reports. He knew precisely what had happened to Invida Station all those centuries ago and if he... shaded the truth of just how much he knew from his underlings, it was for their own good. There were, after all, things that people were simply not ready to know.", "The prime took a deep breath through his nostrils, smelling the recycled air of his suit and his own sweat mixed with the atmosphere of Invida Station\u2019s previous incarnation. The air down here was still dangerous to breathe freely and despite his respirator\u2019s best efforts, there was a chemical acridity to it that burned his sinuses and threatened to provoke a coughing fit. A touch of decomposition was there too as the bodies laid out in rows slowly rotted, despite the best efforts of the crews to clear them all away. Yiven suppressed the urge to gag on the tainted atmosphere, switching back to his suit\u2019s internal supply. He would need to do so anyways, once they reached their destination. As if on cue, with a muted ping, the car shuddered to a halt, its doors grinding open and Yiven stalked out into the bowels of Invida Station\u2019s murdered predecessor.", "This, the prime thought sourly. This is price of our treasure. His Invida Station had been built upon the dead, twenty thousand souls living above a mass grave. He didn\u2019t know what Command wanted with the \u2018package\u2019, but he did not need to. He obeyed. As he had told Nasham, that was his duty, his honour and his privilege. Soon enough, he\u2019d reached the server room.", "\u201cConfirm that all hardlines to the rest of the station have been severed and that there is nothing here it can wirelessly link to,\u201d he said without preamble as he strode into the ancient server hub. The engineers scrambled to obey, quickly ascertaining that the central computer core was isolated from all subsidiary systems. As he waited, Yiven took in the server room, his gaze drifting past the handful of junior officers present. All but one were trying to look equally important and inconspicuous in the presence of a flag officer.", "Group Leader, Submissive Nasham (and six names besides) was the exception, the younger male staying close by one of the work teams and looking towards Yiven with an evaluative expression, clearly wondering about the breadth of his superior\u2019s knowledge of this place. Well, let him wonder. \u201cAll connections are closed,\u201d the submissive reported. \u201cAll link ports are inactive. Generator is active.\u201d", "Yiven nodded curtly. \u201cYou may begin the power-up sequence.\u201d", "The technicians closed the final circuit and with a dull tone, the computer signalled that it was beginning to start up, greedily sucking in energy. The status screen the techs had hooked up flickered to life, numbers and letters running by as the system carried out diagnostics. Finally, the screen went black, a single blinking cursor appearing. A moment passed and then a single line of text appeared:", "where am I?", "Yiven inhaled sharply, ignoring the sudden babble of comments from the assembled workers, officers and engineers. \u201cGet out,\u201d he ordered. \u201cAll of you.\u201d", "~", "It was over an hour before Yiven came out of the hub room. Nasham cocked his head ever so slightly as he regarded the flag officer. Yiven was trying to hide it, but the older man was unsettled, his face drawn and a jerkiness to his motions that spoke volumes. He was holding something in one clenched fist, so tightly that Nasham couldn\u2019t see what it was. \u201cThe work crews will be given seven hours to rest,\u201d Yiven said. \u201cThen this core will be extracted \u2013 intact \u2013 up to the surface and prepared for loading. Extreme caution is to be exercised at all times in handling this item. I remind all of you that you are not to speak of this to anyone, not even among each other. No records are to be made, no notations in journals or work logs. This chamber was void of anything of value. Failure to comply with these edicts will considered willful sedition and be met with the harshest possible penalties. Is that understood?\u201d", "Without further ado, he strode off back down the corridor, his armsmen falling in behind him.", "\u201cIs this what we came here for, patron?\u201d Nasham called after him.", "Yiven paused, though he did not look back. \u201cYes, initiate. It is.\u201d He hesitated a question before deciding to answer Nasham\u2019s unspoken question. \u201cAnd it is worth the price we have paid.\u201d", "The younger man said nothing as he watched the prime take his leave. Yiven may have claimed that this thing was worth the blood price they\u2019d paid... but Nasham had caught the waver in his leader\u2019s voice. He glanced back into the empty room and found his hand straying towards the pistol at his hip.", "~", "Nasham watched as the package was loaded on the shuttle. His security teams were fanned out across the tarmac, ensuring that the handoff to Unmatchable Deed\u2019s own personnel went as smoothly as possible. The young officer adjusted the scarf over his snout as a gust of wind rolled across the open concrete field, carrying a fair amount of sand with it. There were already piles of dirt building up around the shuttle\u2019s landing struts.", "It was taking two heavy lifters operated by the best port workers Invida had to carry the massive device over to the cargo shuttle. The device had been sealed within a heavy, well-armoured canister, several times the height of a man and easily weighing thousands of pounds. The core had never been intended to be moved; like its ruined brothers left in the bowels of the old Invida Station, it had been shipped to the fledgling colony piecemeal, assembled and activated on site. It would have saved a great deal of time to take it apart, but Yiven had expressly forbade such an action. Nasham patted the butt of his pistol again, although he knew it was a foolish thing to do. Still... it was reassuring.", "That innocuous slab of metal housed an abomination. Nasham couldn\u2019t fathom why Command had had this thing created, nor why they wanted it back after nearly two millennia. He couldn\u2019t imagine what need could be so great as to require a \u2018neverborn\u2019, nor did he want to. In this, he was satisfied in his ignorance. The machine would be taken from Invida, greater minds would deal with it and Group Leader, Submissive Nasham Kem Unoth Ludhy Inku Pram Voy would be able to shake the dust from this cursed world from the soles of his feet.", "As the package was secured inside its bay, the shuttle rose into the atmosphere, a powerful downdraft of hot air from its thrusters rolled across the tarmac, battling the gusts of arid wind. Nasham closed his eyes, letting the warmth wash over him and imagining a day, not too long from now, when he would be boarding his own shuttle to leave Invida and its ghosts behind forever.", "~", "Invida Orbital was an Inviolable Belief citadel, intended to defend valuable worlds, vital trading posts, historically significant sites and other important territories. In its prime, it had done just that. But now it was like a faded damsel, no longer invited to the fine galas of her youth. Now, even its name had been stripped from it, bestowed upon a younger and more powerful citadel, while it remained an uninspiring serial number or the equally unimaginative \u2018Invida Orbital\u2019.", "Although Group Leader Dansin (and four names besides) believed that his station still had many more years of loyal service to the Compact left, he would have been prepared to claim that if Command believed the citadel was needed here, then here was where it would serve... at least, until he had received the transfer papers granting him dominion of this bastion. Now, he was more adamant that Invida Station deserved more than this pointless garrison duty.", "Truthfully, despite its age and faded vigour, Dansin had no idea what the orbital was doing here above this worthless speck of dirt. Invida was an arid, wind-swept wasteland. Not enough mineral wealth to justify full-scale mining, not enough interesting life to hold an exobiologist\u2019s interest for more than a week or two. Barely habitable, the planet was on the edge of the system\u2019s life zone, with an elliptical orbit that either saw it being roasted by the system\u2019s primary and scourged by continent-sweeping sandstorms or freezing in the void of space and whipped by equally massive blizzards. As far as Dansin could tell there was nothing about the colony that justified Invida Orbital\u2019s presence and the small squadron of pickets that constantly plied the system for anything remotely resembling a threat to the wind-blown research colony, their crews as bored as Dansin himself.", "Currently, the pickets were amusing themselves by playing war games whose antagonists were increasingly improbable and bizarre. Radio chatter indicated that the last one had involved \u2018nuclear space whales\u2019. Dansin envied them; the most exciting thing he\u2019d dealt with was the arrival and almost immediate departure of the rapid response cruiser, whose name and presence here had been scrubbed from the station\u2019s databanks. Column Leader Prime Yiven\u2019s orders had been very clear; no mentions in personal journals, written accounts or images of Unmatchable Deed were to exist. Even the comm logs in which the order had been given were to be erased entirely. That was unsettling, even more so with the rumours coming up from groundside.", "No \u2018research outpost\u2019 needed the kind of firepower Invida Station had. Almost a third of the souls on the ground were Janissaries. They had a squadron of pickets and Invida Orbital. All a place like this needed was at most a single frigate, a waypost and a few hundred Ground Force regulars.", "Then again, Dansin mused as he skimmed idly through daily status reports that he\u2019d long since stopped reading. The Red Hand have been pushing into this sector... Maybe their presence here wasn\u2019t so inexplicable. All the labcoats down below were doing something hush-hush, something that would be valuable to the Compact... and certainly enticing to any Unbound filth that happened along.", "Still, it was a lot of firepower.", "\u201cWe have an alert. Unscheduled arrival,\u201d the disciple at Operations announced. \u201cShockpoint forming off Invidon. 72% chance of heavy cruiser weight or above. Wait one. Telemetry feeds updating.\u201d", "Dansin swivelled in his chair \u2013 not even a proper command throne \u2013 to his Operations officer. \u201cClarify.\u201d", "\u201cDisciple Harag is correct, patron,\u201d sectator Nevel reported. \u201cReading data from the outer-system scope units. It\u2019s definitely big. Reading substantial mass and energy profile. It\u2019s... wait. Confirm that ident.\u201d", "\u201cConfirmed,\u201d Harag announced. \u201cIFF is clean.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d Dansin snapped. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d", "Nevel looked up, her expression confused. \u201cPatron \u2013 it\u2019s the Dutiful Burden.\u201d"]}

Turned away for one... a pressure door... in half...\u201d Faithful Burz\u2019s voice rumbled in Grace\u2019s ears, as the young women climbed a ladder, still listening to the Tribune\u2019s logs. \u201cThat\u2019s... so far. This ship... toll. The workers are... rumours... about how...\u201d A burst of static obliterated the rest of the dead engineer\u2019s words.

The story, what she could make out from the decayed data tracks, was depressingly similar to the current situation, but there was nothing there that could shed any more light on the specifics. Without more than his familiar name, even Burz himself was impossible to identify. Grace almost growled in frustration, surprising herself. It was getting harder to act as she knew she should.", "She wasn\u2019t certain that she even wanted to. The thought was frightening - she should report herself to confessor Yurim, but she couldn\u2019t. Not until she was done here. She hadn\u2019t even told Nasham she was returning to this part of the ship.", "Her heart was pounding in her chest as she approached a familiar doorway and the young woman\u2019s hand shook as she reached for the control panel. She hesitated a moment before hitting it and stepping through into a room filled with bodies. They were in the exact same positions that she\u2019d left them, most of them with a hole in the back of their heads with the only exception slumped next to the weapon that had killed his fellows. There was something here, something that had caught her attention before, but she hadn\u2019t acted on her intuition. What she was doing could be considered desecration of a Tribune\u2019s body, to say nothing of the many other regulations that said the best thing she could do was leave this to others.", "Allyria wouldn\u2019t have. At least, not without an argument. Somehow, that thought gave her the courage to continue.", "The young woman knelt beside the executioner\u2019s corpse, trembling fingers reaching out to the soldier\u2019s chestplate. This Tribune had been an officer, an ideologue. The first time she\u2019d come here, she\u2019d swiped away the decades\u2019 worth of dust over his curiously blank nameplate. One of the service markers there had seemed familiar; jaws enclosing a world of blue and green. The pattern of the landmasses was generic; convention dictated that there be nothing singling a particular location out on any decoration. It wasn\u2019t until Grace had been back at base camp that she\u2019d remembered where she\u2019d seen another sigil like this one.", "Grace\u2019s hand shook and she willed herself to be steady as she swept more of the dust from the ideologue\u2019s cuirass, uncovering the entire row of campaign marks. She touched two fingers to the one she\u2019d recognized \u2013 she\u2019d seen it somewhere else. Not as a simple decal, but on a medallion. She\u2019d had occasion to wear her dress uniform only once, when her class had met the commanders and staff of Bequeathed. Kilgrave had been wearing the medal. She\u2019d thought he looked like a hero, his breast decorated with service medals from his service in the Janissary Corps. One of Rally\u2019s successes, trained as a soldier yet he\u2019d impressed his superiors with his dedication and bravery and been elevated to the officer corps. A symbol of the dedication and capability of humans and the beneficence and gratitude of the Compact \u2013 everything Grace had wanted to be.", "Allyria had hated him the instant she\u2019d laid eyes on him. The Verrish had hid it as well as she could, but she\u2019d been glaring daggers at Kilgrave the entire ceremony. She\u2019d hated him ever since that day, but Grace hadn\u2019t understood why. She\u2019d come to have her own opinion of Kilgrave, but she\u2019d never known why the Verrish had despised the man to such a degree.", "I guess she was just a better judge of character than I was, she thought sadly.

Where the man\u2019s name and serial number should be had been had been removed \u2013 erased completely. Age hadn\u2019t done this, nor had any battle damage. This had been deliberate, an act to erase the soldier\u2019s identity. Grace investigated the other corpses \u2013 like the ideologue, there was no indication of their identities. None of them even carried any personal effects. No trinkets, keepsakes, ornaments or fetishes. This couldn\u2019t have been done post-mortem.

What she\u2019d already done, she could say she was simply attempting to identify the fallen. It wouldn\u2019t win her any points with staff concerned about medical or forensic issues, but it would be hard to call it desecration. If she truly wanted to try and learn who these people were, she\u2019d have to go further. She wasn\u2019t sure she could do that.", "Fortunately, fate intervened. An icon flashed on her HUD and Grace blink-clicked it up. Her suit wasn\u2019t a particularly complex piece of engineering \u2013 it was an all-purpose EVA suit, capable of doing a little of everything and excelling at nothing. She was, however, picking up a power source. It hadn\u2019t been there before. That wasn\u2019t in and of itself unusual; as the repair crews patched the hulk, more of its systems came back, often in sections that had seemed utterly dead.

The shorter girl ran her tongue over her teeth as she squatted, ogre-like, in her armour.

Instead of the blank visor of her own helm, Sang\u2019s armour had an older helmet with red-tinted lenses. It gave her a sinister, almost demonic look. Humans were not imposing on their own and this had been one of many attempts to give human Janissaries a psychological advantage in combat. Tribunes, well over eight feet tall in full armour, didn\u2019t need those kinds of handicaps. The soldier-cadet lifted her head. \u201cI can hear it too.\u201d", "Jessica went very still. \u201cYou can?\u201d she asked softly.", "Jameson slouched down against the bulkhead, looking up at the ceiling. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t speak in Compact Standard,\u201d she said at last. \u201cAnd all I hear are bits and pieces. Like half a conversation through a wall. A syllable here. Maybe a word or two. You listen, because you\u2019re not sure that you heard what you heard. You strain and you listen and all you hear is static and you start thinking you\u2019re crazy, like someone who says they hear voices in the rushing of water. You tell yourself that that\u2019s all it was, you start to relax... and then you hear it again.\u201d", "\u201cNever when there\u2019s someone else around,\u201d Jessica continued. \u201cOnly when it\u2019s just you.

It was a nervous habit, one common to his species, just as Thinkers might blink excessively or Broken sweated. Every minute he spent on this ship gnawed at him. He didn\u2019t want to be here. The angles of the walls were all wrong, the darkness was too absolute, lit only by unpredictable, painful bursts of illumination.", "The helmet lights of his team played over the walls as they crept through the airless corridor, one of many that had lost atmosphere. There was no pattern to the damage, unless one considered having it in the most annoying, inconvenient places to be some kind of pattern and not merely fortune\u2019s whimsy.", "Preparations for the core tap were nearing completion. It was odd \u2013 though he was only a lowly sectator, Gren would have expected preparing to connect an umbilical from the derelict to Bequeathed would be far more difficult than seemed to be \u2013 and that was working with known technology. On this hulk, it should have been taken far, far longer. Instead... issues arose and were solved in record time Gren heard the comments about \u2018amazingly intuitive\u2019 systems and \u2018good fortune\u2019, but he didn\u2019t believe it.

It was irritating that he\u2019d picked up one of their bad habits. And yet...", "...the wreck wasn\u2019t an it. It just wasn\u2019t.", "He had tried to impress his concerns on his superiors, but without any real commitment. He knew the rumours surrounding Pack Leader Nasham and had no wish to be seen as damaged. Unrest was already running through the Broken ranks. Even the officers must have heard the tales being told but they did nothing. Faithful Trenis barely left the hulk\u2019s central core, obsessing over every possible facet of technology, running his teams to the point of exhaustion as they fought, cursed and sweated against the mercurial systems. The expedition\u2019s officers stayed in the secure parts of the ship, unwilling to risk the beast\u2019s spasms. None of them had seen what others claimed to. None of them had heard the music that he had.", "Gren\u2019s head pounded as he remembered that damned litany. It still infested his head, an insensate melody that poisoned his thoughts. Sometimes he thought that he actually was diseased, that he had cracked from the strain. More often, he was wondering if it were not him... if it was everyone else. The ones who hadn\u2019t been into the darkened bowels of her. There was nothing wrong with him.", "There couldn\u2019t be. No, it couldn\u2019t be just him.", "~", "\u201cWith all commensurate respect, patron,\u201d Ashtun said, struggling to hold onto his temper. \u201cWe need to draw down our workforce.

The kerchief caught a gust from the air circulation system and billowed to the floor. The group leader did not move to reclaim it. His steward scurried forward to pick it up, the young woman bowing respectfully as she retreated to fetch a clean cloth.", "Ashtun watched her for a moment. Her pelt \u2013 hair, he reminded himself \u2013 was close-cropped, almost to her skull and she smelled of soap. Human odour was... perhaps not as offensive as some claimed, but it was noticeable to the Tribunes. MacFadden, like many Broken in her position, had to adhere to strict hygienic guidelines. \u201cNo,\u201d he admitted finally. \u201cBut it\u2019s only a matter of time. The shifts aren\u2019t doing morale any favours either.\u201d", "Usul snorted loudly. \u201cThe confessors and my security teams should suffice to keep order amongst the ranks.\u201d", "The submissive shook his head. \u201cRegulations dictate that we should be drawing down our teams, especially since we don\u2019t have a large pool of experienced technicians or officers.\u201d He leaned forward, his posture assertive but not yet challenging. \u201cThese are cadets, patron. This was supposed to be a simple cold-space exercise for the officers and noncoms to give them a taste of the void before we pat them on the head and send them off to some gods-forsaken corner of the realm.

He tapped his fingers against the tabletop, thinking. \u201cThere has still been no response from local command?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d growled Usul, cutting into his steak viciously. \u201cColumn Leader Prime Seyr has not deigned to reply to my missives yet.\u201d", "The younger Tribune kept his expression carefully neutral as he responded. He wasn\u2019t sure what the source of the bad blood behind his leader and the prime was, but he had no desire to get in the middle of it. \u201cIt may take some time to gather assets. Remoulder was, I believe, set to begin laying down the foundations of the Juultan docks. If the prime chooses to send Mortician\u2019s Dismay, that could explain the delay. I understand preparing such a... venerable ship for shocking requires no small effort.\u201d", "\u201cHrrrn,\u201d Usul grunted. \u201cAt the very least, you would think that our superiors would deign to inform us as to their intent.\u201d", "\u201cThey may have,\u201d Ashtun said, sipping at his own wine. Delicious, with a smoky, fruity taste that danced along one\u2019s tongue. The group leader had an excellent sense for vintages and the humans did grow some impressive wines. Exports of Rally\u2019s spirits were a growing concern. \u201cWe were supposed be returning to port by now. Column Leader prime Seyr may have assumed that we had done so and directed any couriers to Rally directly.\u201d", "Usul growled. \u201cI informed him as to our intent.\u201d", "\u2018Our\u2019? An interesting choice of words. \u201cThen I expect we\u2019ll hear from local command shortly,\u201d Ashtun said. He paused. \u201cAlthough it is possible than any courier was lost in transit. Even today, such things do occur.\u201d", "The group leader mused on that thoughtfully. \u201cPerhaps, perhaps. Unlikely, but possible.\u201d He held out his goblet and MacFadden scurried into the room to refill it. Even if the steward had lifted her gaze enough to meet her superior\u2019s eyes, Usul wasn\u2019t looking at her. He sighed again. \u201cThis situation is not what I expected,\u201d he admitted at last. \u201cBut it is the situation we have and we will carry out the mission to secure this wreck and its technology for the glory of the Compact.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, patron,\u201d Ashtun said smoothly, hiding his disquiet. \u201cFor the glory of the Compact.\u201d", "~", "\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Lydia demanded.", "Jessica\u2019s head tilted, the red lenses of her eyes meeting Jameson\u2019s blank faceplate. \u201cNothing,\u201d she mumbled, turning to go. \u201cNothing.\u201d", "With a growl of synthetic muscles, Lydia rose to her feet, putting one hand on Sang\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s not good enough, Five.\u201d", "Sang shook off her comrade\u2019s touch. \u201cToo fucking bad.

Done,\u201d Jameson snarled, feeling her cheeks flush with equal parts shame and anger.", "Jessica stared at her as if shocked, though her demon-faced helm was expressionless. Then with an inarticulate cry, the cadet threw herself at her fellow Janissary. Both young women slammed together like bull elephants, grappling, swearing and raining blows on each other. It was stupid, pointless \u2013 if any officers (or God forbid, Trion) had seen this, both cadets would have been flogged, perhaps even discharged from service entirely. Finally, the combatants broke apart. Though Jessica\u2019s shoulders were squared she was braced, ready for another bout, Lydia started laughing, laughing so hard that only her armour kept her on her feet.", "\u201cWhat?\u201d Sang snapped, confused and angry.", "Lydia struggled to form words through her laughter. \u201c\u2018Subject shows aberrant aggressive tendencies\u2019,\u201d she said, quoting from her own psychological file. \u201c\u2018Subject is estimated on to be a 3.8 on the Kiener-Wernham social assimilation index. Indelible resistance to authority, unacceptable levels of aggression and a consistent pattern of rejection of social norms and doctrines. Repeated failure to comply with appropriate behaviours. Subject has difficulty forming emotional connections and trust with properly socialized individuals. Frequent association with other ongoing and potential maladaptives. I don\u2019t feel that she would benefit from further counselling. Instead, I\u2019m forced to recommend conscription to Janissary Corps. If this socialization fails to stabilize her, chemical behaviour modification is the only option.\u201d", "There was a moment of silence and then a low, buzzing chuckle grated through Jessica\u2019s helm. \u201cYou were only 3.8? I was a 4.2. My headbender said I had severe antagonistic proclivities and impulse control problems.\u201d There was another stretched quietude. \u201cIt\u2019s... it\u2019s not like a conversation,\u201d Sang said at last. \u201cI\u2019m not that bugfuck. I just... every so often, I hear a word. I think. When it\u2019s quiet, when there\u2019s no one else around. It-it feels like the walls start to close in and...

Then, cautiously, they walked towards the source.", "~", "The ship was old \u2013 that wasn\u2019t any revelation. Grace had known that from the first day she\u2019d been here. She thought it was even older than the initial analysis had indicated, but she had kept the thought to herself. The young woman was even more convinced that she was right \u2013 not in a way that she could prove, but it felt ancient. For all the damage, it didn\u2019t feel forgotten or abandoned. It was simply old. Maybe even older than the colony on Rally. That would put it \u2013 was it possible? \u2013 about two thousand years old. How could it still be operational? Even the Compact struggled to keep a hull spaceworthy for longer than a handful of centuries.", "Grace ran her fingers over the computer terminal. Like everything else on this ship, it was scaled for beings of human size. Everything about this ship was... familiar. The angles, the shapes, the architecture. It didn\u2019t have the sweeping grandeur of Tribune buildings, nor the arched hallways and wide corridors of Bequeathed. Its blue-grey bulkheads and obsidian floors lacked the shifting colours and textures of Builder tastes, but they also didn\u2019t have the stark drabness of the Thoughtful, nor the concomitant ultraviolet splendour.", "The terminal was set in a small cabin close to one of the starship\u2019s sensor nodes, a vast melange of scopes that the young woman could only guess at. This station was a small, cramped combination research center and maintenance site. An afterthought, there for any member of the crew to go through the raw data taken in by the sensors in relative solitude or for technicians to run diagnostics on the array. It had no holographic capability; a single large screen bracketed by six smaller monitors were its only displays.", "Dust coated the surface and Grace swept the flat of her palm across it, wiping away God-knew how many years of dust and dirt. Static and snow from the screens splashed light across the terminal, filling the room with an inconstant gleam.", "She must have touched something; no sooner had her hand moved over the keyboard, then the screen went blank, ready cursors blinking on each. Words in the alien language appeared on the largest screen, some indicator that Grace couldn\u2019t read. She tried to parse their meaning, but languages were not her best skill. As if tired of waiting for her input, the letters changed, turning into another alien script \u2013 one equally incomprehensible. Still lacking a response, the machine altered its script a third time. A fourth. There \u2013 that one was Compact Standard.", ">THIS COMPUTER WAS IMPROPERLY SHUT DOWN. DO YOU WISH TO CONTINUE START-UP?", "\u201cYes,\u201d Grace mumbled to herself, looking down at the keyboard. The letters had changed there, too. The layout was far from what she was used to, but she found the key it was asking for. With a soft tone, the terminal continued its boot-up sequence. Seconds later, she was staring at a dizzying array of files. There were directories choked with astronomical data \u2013 suns, planets, moons, asteroids and nebulae. More than she could ever have imagined.", "\u201cYou\u2019ve seen so much...\u201d she found herself saying. All these worlds \u2013 there were so many, many more than she had ever dreamed of seeing herself. Most she didn\u2019t even recognize, not even from her astrography classes at the academy. One, though \u2013 she paused over it, frowning. It was a beautiful blue-green world, with masses of golden desert, white ice caps, drifting clouds and the swirling eyes of storms. I know this place. She\u2019d only seen it a handful of times before, in drawings and flitting by during seminars and instructional videos. Her eyes drifted up to the name of the planet, already knowing what she\u2019d see. Vara Tal.", "You were there. You saw her home.", "A familiar ache opened in Grace as she thought of Allyria and the last time the other girl had spoken of home. It seemed like only yesterday, but it had been years ago \u2013 only a week before they\u2019d received their acceptance letters to the Rally Naval Academy. She\u2019d been so anxious as they waited. Allyria had been encouraged to do so by her social worker. Grace had always wanted to see the stars; that Allyria was applying had only cemented her determination. It had been a warm summer\u2019s night. They\u2019d lay beneath the sky, looking up at the shimmering lights of distant suns.", "\u201cWhich one is Vara?\u201d Grace had asked, breaking the silence. They\u2019d lain in the grass, listening to the calls of birds and the chirping of insects.", "Allyria raised one hand, pointing with her little finger at a corner of the sky. \u201cOver there.\u201d There was a catch in her voice that Grace took to be homesickness. \u201cSomewhere.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019ll be different once we graduate,\u201d Grace said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get to see all of these stars ourselves.\u201d She was excited, her voice coming out in a rush. \u201cWe might even be assigned to one of the explorer fleets. Rally\u2019s been getting more and more traffic these last few years \u2013 not just traders or deep-range explorers, but actual scientific expeditions.

We can go anywhere,\u201d Grace continued. \u201cYou could even visit Vara Tal.\u201d", "The other girl made a strangled sound and Grace realized that she\u2019d said something wrong. Allyria never really talked about her home \u2013 only in the most vague terms possible. Grace had always thought that she was just homesick.

It pounded from the skies, beating the plants and grasses flat like a hand pushing down on them. Afterwards, they would rise up again. The esh thetaas would unfurl and fill the air with the scent. Like...\u201d she struggled for an equivalent word. \u201cApricots. Everything smelled alive and wonderful. I loved when it rained. It was like the world was being made new again and every time I could hope that it would wash away...\u201d she trailed off.", "\u201cWash away what?\u201d", "\u201cNothing.

Allyria could sense it, a restlessness running through the bulkheads and circuitry of the Angel\u2019s body. A caged animal, waiting to lash out. The Verrish could understand the impulse; Red One had been built from the ground up to kill, to hunt down her prey and butcher them, a predator cloaked in battle steel. Her \u2018long war\u2019 had only distilled that impulse to its bare essence. Every moment spent waiting was one in which she was not giving vent to her rage.", "Allyria could relate. She looked down at her hands, her blunted claws extending from their sheathes. She remembered the sneering face of the first Tribune she\u2019d slashed with them. She\u2019d been a child, heading back to her hated foster home after school, fighting back tears with every step. She\u2019d hated Rally. The way it smelled, the alien tint of its sky and its plants. The people. The humans \u2013 they hadn\u2019t been anything like the stories. They moved wrong, they kept their eyes down when one of the asla hiek \u2013 the Tribunes \u2013 spoke to them.

She\u2019d already proven her capabilities to his satisfaction. Still, there wasn\u2019t an instant of hesitation before she gave her answer. \u201cI can do it,\u201d Echo asserted. She licked her teeth. She could do so much more but for her chains. Thinking of this mission, it made her... hungry, awakening some need inside her. Some craving \u2013 some instinct, as amusing as that descriptor was. \u201cI can do it.\u201d", "There was an eagerness to the human\u2019s voice that seemed out of place, but Renan put it from his mind for the moment and turned to look at Desren. \u201cThere, you see?\u201d", "The younger man did not look convinced. He stalked forward and circled Echo, his nostrils twitching. \u201cIt can do this?\u201d he said to Renan. \u201cForgive me, bastion leader.

He regarded Desren coolly. \u201cYou were not brought here for a debate, group leader and certainly not for an argument. If this mission is to be successful, the emissary has a function that she cannot fulfill aboard my ship. You are to consider her a mission specialist for your part in the operation, group leader and one who does have some understanding of our objectives.\u201d", "\u201cOf course,\u201d chastised, Desren lowered his head in acknowledgement.", "\u201cGood. This human was chosen by a Triarch itself to be its emissary. I will not have our leader\u2019s will challenged by a mere group leader.\u201d Renan continued, shooting a warning glare at Echo, who simply blinked, her expression utterly blank. \u201cThis Broken is deeply irritating. It is insubordinate, irreverent and defiant. It is also very capable and it speaks with the authority of the Triarchs, so you will listen.\u201d", "Renan\u2019s voice softened. \u201cYou are my finest strike wing commander, group leader.

I know my duty and I will not let my feelings interfere.\u201d He finally looked away from the small female. \u201cI apologize for my lack of control. I do not have... much experience with such things.\u201d He did not, however, apologize to the emissary herself.", "\u201cAnd you,\u201d Echo said, cocking her head at ideologue Volk. \u201cYou\u2019re here to make sure I stay I alive.\u201d", "Volk grinned, the gesture nothing but teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s so, emissary.\u201d", "\u201cYou served in the 1,913rd.\u201d", "\u201cAye, with the Aberrants. Your blood did well. They breached Iyken Kar\u2019s walls. Died to the last, but they held long enough for the rest of use to get inside.\u201d", "There was a flash of something on the human\u2019s face, there and gone so quickly that Renan couldn\u2019t identify it. Pride in her kin? Grief at their passing? He doubted it. Anger at those that had sent them to their deaths? Also unlikely, but possible. \u201cThe ideologue will personally lead your escort,\u201d Renan informed the Broken. \u201cAdvocate, submissive Tenem will also be accompanying you.\u201d", "She smiled at that. \u201cGood. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without my loyal hound at my heels.\u201d", "The submissive stirred, but made no further indication that he\u2019d heard his ward. The female raised her head. \u201cWhen can I board?\u201d", "Desren coughed into his hand. \u201cBlack Arrow has no human crew. We will need to prepare suitable quarters and take on provisions to meet your needs, emissary.\u201d", "\u201cWe will attack Yulzhak Daun in three days,\u201d Renan rumbled. \u201cYou will join the Veiled Archers shortly. Until then, we,\u201d the Tribune flag officer managed not to grind his teeth as he said this. \u201cwill use your skills here, emissary.\u201d", "\u201cVery well,\u201d Echo made a salute to the assembled officers, one as perfect in form as it was hollow in intent. \u201cIf you have nothing else for me, I will return to my work.\u201d", "Renan nodded in dismissal. As soon as the doors closed behind her, Desren turned to his superior. \u201cI will obey,\u201d he affirmed. \u201cBut I wish it noted that I object in the harshest possible terms to this.\u201d", "\u201cNoted, initiate,\u201d Renan grunted. \u201cJust be sure to sever all non-vital connections when she carries out that phase of the mission.\u201d", "The group leader nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI apologize if I overstep myself, patron... but did the Triarch say why this Broken is under such restrictions?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d Renan replied, keeping his suspicions to himself. \u201cJust be ready to follow your orders should it be necessary.\u201d He cast a sidelong glance at Volk. \u201cDo you understand, ideologue?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d the Janissary replied, one hand drifting to rest on the butt of the gun on his hip. \u201cBut I don\u2019t need to.\u201d"]}

This wasn\u2019t just the usual pattern \u2013 they were preparing for something.", "Alert Five\u2019s sensor mistress shook her head, her crests flat against her head and neck. \u201cNo, master.

Threat icons were appearing on the display. Four. Seven. Fifteen. More. More. More. This wasn\u2019t a lone scout testing their responses or a probe pecking away at Yulzhak\u2019s defences.

A system kill.", "The young man looked up at his comm specialist, his expression drawn. \u201cAlert the inner system.\u201d He leaned further over the sensor mistress\u2019s shoulder as he studied the display. The Compact force was reverting in tight formation \u2013 the bastards had a gift for synchronized emergences \u2013 but their formation was too tight. There was something in there that they didn\u2019t want anyone to see.

Overkill; a single beam-rider would have destroyed the listening post. For herself, she would have preferred to send in a single stealthed interceptor and kill the station quietly, dropping the task force deeper in-system. Still, Renan\u2019s strategy appeared sound, if seemingly uninspired: a single mailed first directed at the heart of the Askanj defences, trusting to sheer brute strength over maneuver and strategy.", "Appearances, Echo mused, curling a forelock of dark hair around her finger. They lie. Her lips twitched up in a small little grin and she ran her tongue over her teeth. They lie indeed. Pushing the amusement at her private little joke, the emissary turned her attention back to Black Arrow\u2019s tactical plot, her eyes darting from icon to icon, drinking in every bit of information. It wasn\u2019t enough, wasn\u2019t fast enough... wasn\u2019t anything enough for her. She wanted, needed, craved more...", "...and this was what she had. She forced the resentment from her mind for the moment, returning to her considerations of the tactical situation.", "A cursory observation would have made one wonder if the bastion leader\u2019s reputation was exaggerated. As it was, Echo was enjoying the spectacle, the breaths she didn\u2019t need catching in her throat as she waited for the next note in the symphony. Her fingers moved in time to a melody that no one else heard and she closed her eyes for the briefest of moments, wishing that she could hear the sound of running water.", "~", "It was a widely-accepted fact that the Compact of Species, despite whatever philosophical disagreements, territorial conflicts, trade arguments and political differences that it had with every other nation in the galaxy, were the pre-eminent shipbuilders. Their material science was generations ahead of even their Askanj rivals, their screens stronger, their acceleration curves sharper. Internal systems were heavily protected and multiple redundancies prevented easy \u201clightswitch\u201d kills. On average, a Compact vessel of any given class had to sustain penetrating damage on over 30% of its surface before core system functions were compromised and it could remain combat-capable up until it was barely recognizable as a starship. Compact ships could withstand damage that would cripple virtually any other vessel of a similar class and remain combat-capable. Less-advanced civilizations often struggled to kill even the lightest Compact vessels.", "The durability of their warships made Compact commanders much more aggressive than the captains of other nations; a Compact officer could commit their vessels to actions that would see virtually any other equivalent starship destroyed and not only survive, but emerge victorious. As Compact ships were both more manoeuvrable and possessed higher accelerations than many competing ship classes, it was rare that the Compact did not dictate the flow of battle. In turn, this aggression led to very straightforward tactics, the Compact\u2019s technical superiority ossifying these attributes. A noted Compact flag officer was once quoted as saying: \u201cBattles of maneuver are for those who can only run.\u201d", "None of this changed the fact that the Askanj Principality was the Compact\u2019s deadliest enemy. More than five hundred ships stood between Bastion Leader Renan\u2019s fleet and the command nexus itself and if each of them was inferior to a comparable vessel from the Space Force, it was not such a degree of inferiority that an easy victory was assured. Principality ships had superior command and control facilities, improved datalinks and all the other benefits that went with their fore advanced electronics. This allowed Askanj fleets to react far faster than a Compact battle force, giving them at least one advantage on the battlefield.", "Seated in his command throne, Renan had his fingers laced together, his attention fixed to the main tactical plot. The Jackal commander\u2019s response was prompt, he would give him that much. Already, the local picket forcess were falling back with a telltale alacrity, boosting towards the nearest citadel. The listening post had pierced his deception after all. Most annoying, but he had never truly expected it to survive the first exchange of fire. In order to bring their Chariot further in-system before detection, some more callous officers might have even refused to contribute to the armada\u2019s defence, allowing their fleets to take the brunt of the first few salvos, to prevent the Askanj from confirming their presence. Renan was not that type of commander. At least, he hoped that he wasn\u2019t.", "\u201cNotify Squadron Turak to disperse further,\u201d he ordered. \u201cAnother two million kilometers per craft.\u201d It was an understandable mistake; Principality missiles had weaker warheads but slightly longer range than his own. They also did love their railguns, their annoying proficient computer networks allowing them to be used at ranges Compact commanders could only dream off. Turak\u2019s positioning was optimal for mutual support from missiles and railfire... but not against a sudden massed charge. The Jackals loved playing in the libration points, yes they did. The Askanj were tricky warriors. None of their mongrel races had the liver for a pure battle, but they more than made up for that with cleverness.", "He\u2019d seen it before; a formation advancing on a Principality position, their screens set forward to endure both missiles and railfire being caught by surprise as the devious Jackals shocked right on top of them, using an in-system libration point to launch the sally. The formation fell apart as the Principality ships charged into the Compact\u2019s midst, a suicide run on the command vessel and its deputies. Thrown into disarray, the formation was then easily destroyed by the surviving Jackal forces. Yes, he had seen it happen... the bastion leader absently touched a hand to the left breast of his uniform, just above where a piece of shrapnel had cut into him.", "Renan gestured and the display shifted, providing a readout on the forces arrayed against him. Too much of the data was incomplete or painted in by the ship\u2019s analysts and logic engines. He knew some details (and suspected others), but he would have preferred to know more of the composition of the defenders. As every leader in every battle has ever wished, he remonstrated himself with a mental chuckle.", "Still, it bothered him that he had had no time for proper reconnaissance, even if he could have been assured that his scouts would not be detected. As the Principality were not idiots, prolonged scouting would have them bolstering their defences and making an operation that already had a high likelihood of failure an outright impossibility. Many of Renan\u2019s subordinate leaders would revel in the glory of this battle, their hunger for renown sated by this \u2018valiant strike against the simpering Principality\u2019, or however the newreels would spin it. There would be toasts raised to every enemy ship destroyed, tales spun of valour and claims of whipping the Askanj into their kennels.", "He cared nothing for any of it; this battle served the Compact only in the data his teams could take from the Jackals\u2019 databanks. Anything he destroyed would be rebuilt before the rest of the crusading fleets could ever take advantage of it and if he dared linger in-system, the Jackals would call in every flotilla in the area to defend their festering hive. He would let his officers chatter in the aftermath; for him the only value was in finding information that could lay bare whatever the Wound was planning and to remember the sacrifice of every soldier he had committed to death this day.", "The bastion leader leaned forward, his eyes watching the swift, unhurried shift in the defenders\u2019 lines and prepared himself for the butcher\u2019s tally to come.", "~", "Located at a nexus of stable shock routes, Yulzhak Daun was the lynchpin upon which hundreds of worlds depended. A command nexus for three dozen sectors, controlling the deployment and operations of nearly seven thousand ships and three hundred inhabited hundred star systems of various sizes and values. A massive fleetyard complex, capable of building and servicing nearly a thousand hulls at any given moment, squatted deep in-system, hundreds of kilometers of shipwombs. Smaller shipyards were scattered throughout the system. These were tasked for both the construction of non-military hulls and the outfitting and repair of civilian ships. Other yards were owned by various corporations to service their own massive fleets: courier services, mining concerns or shipping companies who moved untold trillions of tonnes of material across space. A never-ending flow of these ships came to pay tribute to the hunger of Yulzhak Daun\u2019s yards, drifting processing centers and refineries converting raw materials into the bones and organs of newborn starships. Three billion sentients from all the races of the Principality called Yulzhak Daun home, from the officers and noncoms stationed here, to the work crews who built and maintained the vast installations and the service personnel: restaurateurs, shop owners, shipping magnates and entertainers who tended to the needs and wants of the military and corporate personnel.", "It was not an easy target, nor would it be any commander\u2019s first choice of targets. Five rings of orbital fortresses \u2013 palisades to the Askanj \u2013 ran throughout the orbital paths of the system\u2019s twelve planets who were themselves garrisoned by additional palisades, platforms and minefields. Five hundred warships served as a permanent garrison, the Yulzhak Home Fleet comprised of squadrons of light escorts all the way up three battleship regiments and a full super-carrier wing, and there were another hundred warships present for retrofitting, personnel and cargo transfers, convoy escort and other assorted duties.", "Deep in Principality territory, Yulzhak Daun\u2019s overseers had never envisioned their enemy being so bold, nor that they would bring one of their god-ships this deep into their borders. Execution Force Renan emerged on the fringes of the star system, a hundred ships ripping their way into space, swift destroyers and scouting cruisers lunging ahead of the massive battlecruisers and battleships that surrounded the goliath at the heart of their formation. Those hundred ships might exact a heavy toll before being destroyed, but they were so badly outnumbered that the Principality would prevail. All they could do was withdraw before the Askanj fleet reached them.", "The presence of the Chariot changed that equation considerably; only the heaviest palisades had the firepower to kill such a beast. If it were allowed to rampage unchecked, millions would die and Yulzhak Daun would suffer greatly.", "It had to die. Above all else, that ship must be destroyed.", "Further in-system, the larger ships of the Yulzhak Home Fleet roused themselves to full readiness. They had been prepared for this moment and they would engage, but not in time to save their pickets. The defenders of the outer perimeter were already dead. The instant Renan\u2019s command shocked in-system, bludgeoning towards the densest knot of civilian traffic, they\u2019d known that they were going to die. Their lives would be traded in slowing the Compact armada, buying time for the evacuation of the freighters and commerce posts.", "System command directed a demand for the Compact ships to leave the system immediately or face destruction, although no one expected them to heed it.", "~", "Group Leader Desren (and five names besides) struggled not to snap at the human as it wandered around his bridge, like a particularly ugly lost child. He knew it was a Triarch\u2019s chosen emissary, but that made its presence here merely tolerable. He had heard whispers from his crew about this thing, that it was diseased. Not in the normal way \u2013 although Desren knew lesser species (and humans in particular) to be unclean. There was something wrong with its mind, a sickness that should have brought it to the attention of the confessors and social workers. Instead of the corrective surgery or psychological conditioning that such faults should have engendered, somehow this animal had come to the attention of a Triarch itself.", "He felt an unpleasant sensation run up his spine as he regarded the misshapen little beast. He had heard enough about humans to know that they were not merely the unintelligent apes that they appeared to be. They had challenged the Compact, spurred by some madness to hurl themselves at a foe that they could not hope to defeat. Desren had heard the most unpleasant rumours, stories of humans eating the dead, of burning their own cities just to get at Compact forces, of their ships lying amidst the dead to ambush the navy or falling upon helpless freighters and wayposts with berserker savagery. Madness. Infectious, incurable madness across an entire species.", "Desren watched the sow\u2019s fingers twitch spastically and tried not to think more on it. He was about to snap at the human to remain still when she froze, her attention fixed to the tactical board. She didn\u2019t even seem to be breathing. \u201cAnd so,\u201d she whispered suddenly. \u201cAnd so it goes.\u201d She lifted her head to look at Desren. Her eyes glinted with an unhealthy light and her face was flushed. \u201cCan you hear it?\u201d", "\u201cHear what?\u201d the Tribune snapped.", "She turned away, as if she\u2019d lost interest in him. \u201cThe music.\u201d Her smile widened. \u201cIt\u2019s started to rain.\u201d", "~", "In the darkness of its tower, the Triarch looked upon the gleaming stars that surrounded its throne. Pale lips drew back from a mouthful of needle teeth in a smile that split its face, its skeletally thin fingers laced together as it waited.", "~", "\u201cSet all screens forward,\u201d Sigil Leader Aul\u2019ia ordered, the Thoughtful barely glancing at Renan, the bastion leader\u2019s attention fixed to the master plot. Millions of kilometers away, the first deadline waited \u2013 a Jackal citadel. A minor one only, there to convince Unbound of the error of seeking prey among Yulzhak\u2019s many fat merchantmen. Almost thirty Askanj escorts of varying weights lay between the citadel\u2019s gates and the Compact force, screening the transports as they struggled to embark their crews and flee. Their destruction was of no consequence to him, but the loss of so much raw material, so many ships... it would weaken the Principality in this region. Not to any real extent, but it would take that much longer to ship its goods, cost that much more. Another small cut that the Principality must tend to.", "Besides, it was what he would be expected to do if his goal was truly to assault the system in earnest.", "The Tribune\u2019s eyes were intent on the display and he felt the smallest of smiles tug at his lips as he noted the pattern to the Jackals\u2019 formation. He lifted his gaze and regarded Aul\u2019ia. Her lipless mouth was an echo of Renan\u2019s own small self-indulgent amusement.", "We are here to conquer and destroy, are we not?", "Yes, we are.", "~", "Squadron master Kesesh of the \u2018destroyer\u2019 Blood of Majesties chewed his lip thoughtfully as he sat in his command chair, watching the oncoming tide of metal. Like anyone else, the Askanj-teseht would prefer not to die, but there were over four dozen transports and civilian craft berthed at this palisade station. Tens of thousands of lives hung in the balance. He couldn\u2019t \u2013 wouldn\u2019t \u2013 abandon them. The Enemy was without concept of mercy, their divine right to rule granting them absolution from any sin committed in the name of peace. Their peace.", "\u201cDo we have shooting solutions?\u201d he asked in calmly, as he had every other time. Gleaming Eyes at Dusk, the ship\u2019s second mistress, bobbed her head in the negative, an annoyed hiss slithering through her teeth. Her irritation was not directed at him, but towards the Compact who had learned a few new tricks in how to shroud their vessels.", "\u201cNot yet,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re still too far out.\u201d The end of her tail twitched. Save for Kesesh himself and the communications officer, the destroyer\u2019s command deck was populated entirely by Askanj-illith. On his first day in command, Kesesh had trod on no fewer than four of his subordinates\u2019 tails and the rest of the week hadn\u2019t gone much better. They\u2019d called him Squadron Master Lead-Foot, the title now used more in affection than pained irritation. In fairness, the serpentine Askanj-illith were over half tail... and it was a very small bridge.", "A sad little smile touched his lips as he looked around his command, at the cramped confines of duty stations pressed up against each other, sinuous bodies hunched over consoles, the gleam of holograms and display screens shining against iridescent scales.", "I\u2019m going to miss this ship, Kesesh thought. He remained in silence until Gleaming Eyes at Dusk raised her head, her crest flaring as she bared her teeth. She didn\u2019t even need to say it; data from the fleet\u2019s predictive engines was populating the master holo tank, firing patterns coming up as the Tactical officers in the squadron streamlined the data coming to them. Ready icons pulsed a deep orange. \u201cAll ships linked in,\u201d the Askanj-illith reported. \u201cWe are ready for salvo fire at your command.\u201d", "The squadron master nodded. \u201cRapid launch mode.\u201d Kesesh reached out, his fingers drifting through the mirage of hostile ship icons and his squadron\u2019s readiness indicators. He was looking for something... there. \u201cThis one,\u201d he ordered, wrapping his fingers around one hull in particular. The logic engine pulsed a dull blue halo around the vessel, confirming his guess. \u201cThis one dies first.\u201d Gleaming Eyes nodded, gesturing to Communications, who updated the squadron\u2019s firing orders.", "The squadron master let his eyes drift further into the plot, towards the massive, brooding threat icon of the enemy Chariot. May all the gods damn you to hell.", "\u201cLoose,\u201d he ordered.", "~", "Blood of Majesties, like the other ten members of its squadron, was the Principality\u2019s primary response to the Compact\u2019s superiority in heavy capital ships. Early on in their history, the Askanj had built vessels that could be considered dreadnaughts as a counter to the Compact\u2019s own Chariots. Unfortunately, the construction and operation of such massive vessels represented a technological barrier that at the time the Principality had yet to cross. Consequently, their initial run of titan-grade warships fared very poorly against Chariots. Aside from a handful of anomalous encounters, this was a pattern that never reversed itself throughout the two nations\u2019 long and bloody history.", "The Principality largely abandoned development into dreadnaughts. In the centuries to follow, the project would be occasionally be restarted. Lack of political will often killed these enterprises swiftly, but they would sometimes be seen to completion. The inevitable humiliating defeat would then serve to bury dreadnaught research for many more generations. The fact of the matter was, that despite their advantages in other areas, the many races of the Principality were at a consistent disadvantage in the production, operation and utilization of dreadnaught-scale vessels. Nor were they alone; smaller star nations had economically destroyed themselves merely in the attempt to build vessels that could successfully engage a god-ship of the Compact.", "Humanity\u2019s success against Bringer of Light had, at one point, stoked interest among the Great Houses of the Principality \u2013 enough to consider supporting the Confederacy, although the fall of Earth came before any decision could be reached. This fascination had only been renewed in the centuries since, when the tale of a most unusual reaver reached their ears. They had never been able to match the Compact on an equal footing and the chance to acquire Nemesis for themselves was too good to pass up. Their industrial might was only overshadowed by their enemy\u2019s and whereas the Compact only produced dreadnaughts in a slow but steady trickle, the Principality would gleefully throw every scrap of manufacturing power they had into mass-producing such titans.", "Until that day came, they would simply have to make do with ships like Blood of Majesties.", "It was a second-generation  Impaler class \u2018destroyer\u2019, sacrificing virtually all other armament for the powerful rail cannon that it had been built around, a gun eight hundred meters long. Even larger than those found upon battleships and Chariots, it was a siege weapon. Powerful analytical systems watched the Compact fleet, a shell of drones and recon platforms licking at and prying through the enemy\u2019s jamming to observe fleet disposition, course and acceleration. That information was sent back to Blood of Majesties and its data-linked cousins, their battle analysis programs developing fire patterns, the squadron tightly bound as single entity.", "Upon Kesesh\u2019s order, his squadron went to rapid-fire. Eleven railguns fired as one, each of them hurling a shell towards the Compact fleet at eighty-four percent of light speed. Seven seconds later, they did it again. And again.", "And again.", "~", "The leading elements of Execution Force Renan writhed in a hellstorm as they waded through blast after blast, screens shunting aside the worst of the radiation. The range was long; it would take several minutes for any railfire to reach them and even the most simple of maneuvers could cause a kinetic impactor to miss by hundreds, if not thousands of kilometers. This problem was one that the Principality had long since solved: fire, and keep firing. Drown your opponent in so much ordnance that you couldn\u2019t fail to hit them, sooner or later.", "As for the misses, that was, of course, what the warheads were for.", "As soon as each projectile\u2019s onboard tracking systems estimated that it would not hit its target, it carried out its only other function. Matter and antimatter merged in a terrible embrace and vast, terrible flares burst across the starscape. Even if those were too far away to damage their targets, the blasts would burn out any sensors looking their way, the thermal scars and swathes of radiation left in the aftermath confusing Compact sensors and eroding their EW systems.", "The destroyer Tigurin Nzeth shouldered its way through one such detonation, the explosion far too close for comfort. Radiation hazard warnings flashed brightly across the main display. The ship\u2019s commander bared her teeth, her fist hammering the arm of her chair as Nzeth ploughed towards the enemy counterparts, still outside the armada\u2019s missile range. The execution force\u2019s own railguns were silent; Compact computers were not as adept as the Jackals\u2019. The Askanj were cowards who shunned combat, relying on their damned railfire to whittle Compact fleets down to odds that they found favourable.", "An alarm thrummed and the group leader lifted her head, grimacing. The enemy\u2019s targeting was narrowing; they\u2019d identified Nzeth\u2019s brother, Tigurin Naketh as the squadron\u2019s leader. The destroyer thrashed and rolled through the cone of fire, its every maneuver planned for, vast explosions ripping all around it. Already, Naketh was taking damage from so many near misses. A single direct hit and the squadron would lose its datalinks, a small but noticeable chink opening in the fleet\u2019s defence envelope. Tigurin Naketh needed time to withdraw, to rebuild their ECM shrouds and hide once more. Time that they just didn\u2019t have.

Indeed, he\u2019d specifically chosen this emergence point in the hopes of confronting them. Against the massed screens of his fleet, their backs to the citadel \u2013 they would die. If he had ignored or avoided them, they would harry his flanks and rear, picking away at his strength and running from retribution... until the range opened and they could fire again.", "It was the cold equations of void war.

There; they\u2019d entered missile range.", "~", "The fortress fired first, launching nearly one hundred missiles at the Compact fleet. It was the only defensive unit that could hold missiles with enough range to reach them; the warheads the escorts and light cruisers had simply didn\u2019t have the range to cross the distance between the approaching fleets. Their drives would burn out long before reaching effective attack range. The distance to the Compact fleet was dropping steadily; they were, in fact still outside the outer limits of the Principality attack envelope, but the armada was closing so quickly that by the time the missiles reached them, they would be in range.", "Askanj weapons masters didn\u2019t bother to try to penetrate the thick ECM shell that surrounded the hostile dreadnaught; they had no chance of doing so, or even getting their missiles through the Compact\u2019s fleet. Their missile was to strip that fleet from the dreadnaught, to pull away its support and leave it unprotected.", "\u201cPoint defences to supporting fire. Open the fleet,\u201d Renan ordered. \u201cGive us a clear firing line.\u201d Pulling his ships further out of each others\u2019 support range would increase the damage caused by the citadel\u2019s opening salvos, but it was the cold equations. This many now or that many later. \u201cOnce you are satisfied with the solution, Flush all external racks. Leave nothing.\u201d", "Renan allowed himself a single, small tight smile as he imagined the enemy officer\u2019s reaction. You are not the sole voice of innovation in this galaxy. A Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment Chariot carried an external payload of over eight hundred heavy capital missiles, the largest shipborne warheads in existence. Only cairn-type citadels and the Wound carried heavier weapons. Normal engagement range was twenty-four million kilometers. The Principality\u2019s drives gave their weapons slightly longer bite; close to twenty-eight million for their own heavy shipkillers. Redemption of Sol had just launched from over thirty million kilometers. The Principality had thought they were safe from retaliation, that they could choose the pace of their assault. Now, they were struggling to override pre-set firing plans, to set up new firing plans \u2013 to take into account the fact that they would be dead much sooner than they had anticipated.", "They did their best. The would-be godkillers fired until the heat from their railcannons damaged their own ships and eroded their own ECM, angling proximity-fused shells into the midst of that swarm. The point defences from their more conventionally armed compatriots swept through the swarm, counter-missiles preceding a desperate fusillade of lasers. Updated orders from Redemption of Sol changed targeting priorities and several dozen missiles heeled away, driving down the throat of the destroyers firing upon them, forcing them to choose between protecting themselves or defending the fortress.", "Distant flashes of light, temporary stars gleaming with painful brilliance before fading, marked each lost vessel. Blood of Majesties was targeted by no less than three shipkillers, and it vanished in a searing conflagration that left nothing behind but an expanding cloud of molecular gas. The remains of its squadron, their command links severed, fought and died alone, burning as brightly as their lost command ship. The station they had hoped to protect followed them into death, its hull gouged and scored, secondary explosions chewing its ravaged husk to pieces, hurling asteroid-sized fragments of the outpost and the freighters still docked to it in all directions.", "Renan\u2019s losses were lower than he\u2019d expected \u2013 the citadel had managed to get several follow-on salvos off before it had been destroyed, but they had been rushed and ill-targeted. The station\u2019s destruction had severed what command links the warheads had and they had stupidly rushed into his massed fire, lost their locks or chased scope-ghosts into the ether.

There was no sand, not any more: only glass and molten pools of metal. There was nothing organic; it had all been vapourized.

With only the smallest smattering of life barely worthy of the name, it was perfect for resource extraction, mining and eventual planetcracking. The Justamian Ore and Energy Concern had bid for and been granted an exclusive Right of Exploitation to Delacore. Mining stations and foundries were established, with nearly four-point-seven million workers shipped in from offworld, just for the first phase of operations.", "The planet itself was not the only prize; the entire system had been blessed with an abundance of mineral wealth and resources, enough to build, fuel and supply thousands of ships. Full resource extraction could take centuries and the company would reap the benefits of wringing every last drop of profit from the system. That was where Ashl\u2019eua came in; she was an expert at undersea mining and Delacore had rich mineral deposits beneath its seabed, just waiting to be snapped up.", "They\u2019d brought her in specially to get that phase of their operations back on track; the ocean mining had run into delay after delay. Administrative, technological \u2013 even worker unrest amidst the formation of an illegal union. She could little about that, but she had been able to assist with other problems. Whoever had been in charge before she arrived had been an idiot \u2013 the topographic surveys she\u2019d found were incomplete, corrupt or simply outright inaccurate. Misfiled documents, a database in shambles. Duplication of work here, ignoring untapped veins there. Unacceptable. Like many of her people, Ashl\u2019eua had a predilection for detail work and this... this was... unacceptable! It took most of her first month just to get everything in order.", "Oh, the department heads swore that they didn\u2019t know anything about that, that they were positive every possible precaution and procedure had been followed, but their computers told a different story. Wasteful deployment of mining rigs to areas with little or no value. Consistent network and system errors that had not yet been scrubbed from their system. Conflicting orders to work crews. It was as if these people either had no clue what they were doing, or were determined to sabotage each others\u2019 work \u2013 and oh, wasn\u2019t that was a common excuse: \u2018I took those readings myself \u2013 it must have been (and here the scapegoat was named) who misfiled/altered/destroyed them!

She was not a manager, not someone who particularly wanted to be or enjoyed working with people \u2013 the Thoughtful felt that they tended to get underfoot more than not \u2013 but the extreme incompetence of the operation had forced her to take an active hand. If they were going to behave like children, then that\u2019s how she would treat them. Computer access had been restricted, vital files had been completely removed from the network and required her permission to access. All orders required a confirmation code. All data must be manually backed-up in offline servers.", "The complaints had been strenuous, but Ashl\u2019eua had been relentless in pushing her changes down the company\u2019s throat. She didn\u2019t care that she was \u2018strangling productivity\u2019 \u2013 at least with her reforms, there was some productivity instead of the breeding ground of internecine bickering, recriminations and self-defeating sabotage. Things had been looking up for the first time in months.", "Then, they had found the ship.", "Submerged beneath Hypirodon Bay, it had been resting on the seabed. There had been no violence to its arrival here, so it was not a crash. Its landing had been controlled and measured; the sediment deposition and local geography clearly indicated that it had arrived there and landed with all the grace something of its mass was capable of. There were a few hydrothermal vents in Hypirodon; perhaps it had intended to tap them for geothermal power? Whatever the reason was, it was not blocking access to any valuable metal deposits, so it was none of her concern. The Thoughtful was content to leave it at that. Her specialities were in geology, resource extraction, paleontology \u2013 not exobiology, engineering or anthropology.", "She did note its presence in her reports to company headquarters, but had not concerned herself with it further \u2013 her job was to get operations back on track, not waste time and man-hours on playing with some salt-rusted relic. However, events had conspired to change that. In the fastest response from headquarters ever, she had been ordered to secure the wreck and to draw up plans for salvage and/or recovery.", "A needless waste of time and resources that Ashl\u2019eua had stewed over each and every day. It had been a relief when the military had moved in to \u2018oversee\u2019 the project. Little more than an observer to the goings-on, the Thoughtful had been able to devote some time back to the mining operations, although it hadn\u2019t lasted. It wasn\u2019t long before she\u2019d been effectively conscripted to work on data analysis. Unacceptable. Unfortunately, the company had been very vocal in its agreement with, and subordination to, the military for this project. Most unusual, given the extrasolars\u2019 usual resistance to governmental intrusion in their affairs. Something else she didn\u2019t want to be interested in, but which nonetheless niggled its way through the back of her brain.", "Annoying as it was, the Thoughtful had been proud of herself for developing a means of extracting the hulk. It would take half a dozen mining rigs working in concert and the assistance of several of Delacore\u2019s orbital works, but it would safely and quickly remove the unclassified vessel from the seabed. What it was doing there \u2013 that was another irritating, itching little fact. Still, her superiors had seemed impressed by her work \u2013 which they\u2019d then showed by exiling her from her own offices on board the command rig, banishing her to a small coastal office building.", "Well, at least it gave her a view of Hypirodon Bay, so she could view her work come to fruition. The rigs were in position, the recovery ships and orbital works all in place. Hypirodon beach was filled, almost to the horizon with watchful military forces \u2013 armoured divisions, artillery, fixed emplacements. The sky buzzed with pinnaces, shuttles and gunships. Everything appeared to be ready.", "Finally, the first contact team descended to the vessel, bleating a transmission in all known languages. They had announced themselves as agents of the Compact of Species and were eager to open a dialogue with whomever was aboard.", "The answer had been as shocking as it had been unexpected, a golden beam of light ripping up from the depths, annihilating the contact team and spearing the command rig straight through the heart. In an instant, the platform was transformed into a cloud of vapour, ignited fuel stores splashing throughout the cove.", "There\u2019d been a single text transmission from the unknown. It had ripped its way into the wireless networks, taking control of every computer it could reach. Despite the situation, Ashl\u2019eua had felt a little flicker of pride that her security measures kept it from taking absolute control of her rigs\u2019 networks. That self-assurance had died in the next instant as a message appeared on every subverted screen:", "BURN WITH ME", "Against the voice in her head that told her to run from the building, jump in her aircar and keep driving until it ran out of fuel, Ashl\u2019eua had stepped outside into the once-chilly Delacore morning, the orange glow of burning fuel filling the bay. Ignoring all sense of reason, she had walked up to a small cliff overlooking the bay, stood on the edge and watched a demon\u2019s birth. Her staff had done the more reasonable thing and fled. Some had even tried to get her to come with them, but she had ignored them all.", "It had risen from the inferno, sheets of blazing water spilling from its hull, patches of burning oil and fuel clinging to its baroque armour, flickering like the torches lining the walls of some ancient fortress. Thin, blazing lances had licked from its flanks, each barely kissing the remaining mining rigs surrounding the titan. Fresh flames had risen into the night sky, the shudder of the platforms\u2019 deaths rolling across the bay like thunder.", "The army had reacted, opening up with everything they had, sheets of fire lancing from the beach at the hostile. For all their fury, their fusillade barely scratched its armour.", "It fired again, its beams ripping up into the morning sky. Dull flashes of light had followed them as the stations and satellites hanging overhead died. Almost negligently, it had swatted the fighters and gunships strafing it, sending more wreckage to burn in the water. It had hung in mid-air, glistening and aflame as the burning water still fell from it, rotating to face the army arrayed against it. There had been something in that moment; Ashl\u2019eua couldn\u2019t have said what... but it could have killed them at any time. It didn\u2019t need to face them. Was it enjoying their helplessness? Was it considering them, some alien mind churning slowly before reaching the inevitable conclusion? Was it hate that made it want to look upon them? She didn\u2019t know \u2013 she\u2019d never know \u2013 and she\u2019d be happier for it.", "What had seemed an eternity was only a handful of seconds. A single sweep of a beam and the army vanished. The beach upon which they\u2019d stood melted to liquid glass. Tanks boiled away to nothing. Power-armoured troopers evaporated. Soldiers \u2013 thousands of men and women \u2013 reduced to ash and dust in a single moment, slaughtered as easily as the mining platforms.", "It hadn\u2019t even hesitated, rising up into the sky, the power of its thrusters boiling and lashing the ocean beneath. In seconds it was nothing but an indistinct shape in the closing clouds and soon, not even that. With the muted crash of distant thunder, Ashl\u2019eua heard it fire again. She didn\u2019t know at what; she didn\u2019t want to know.", "She stood there for a very long time, unable to move. Not until a coast guard vessel saw her on the edge of the cliff, staring out at the broken sea.", "There were no gods, but there were demons. She\u2019d seen one rise from Hell.", "To this day, the reason for the Wound\u2019s presence on Delacore has never been discovered, nor its esoteric method of concealment. It is believed that its presence was in some way related to the Delacore System Kill which occurred seventeen months later."]}

Caught off-guard by the ship\u2019s actions and capabilities, the vessels of Invida\u2019s defence force began an hours-long sternchase to intercept the kamikaze. Invidon was approximately 900 million kilometers from the system primary and 800 million from Invida itself. Dutiful Burden\u2019s acceleration continued, surpassing the known limits of Aroghest-777 engines. Its maximum observed velocity exceeded thirty percent of light. The freighter refused to acknowledge further hails, evading or outrunning each intercept attempt.", "During the 30 hours Dutiful Burden was in-system, surviving records agree that local defence forces repeatedly engaged the hostile; multiple and sustained missile hits were noted, but were unable to overwhelm its augmented screens and improved ECM suite. Point defences were operational, but no attempt to fire on the attacking vessels was made. After-action analysis indicated that all power was being directed to engines, screens and electronic warfare suites.", "Had several pickets been able to mass their fire against Dutiful Burden, a complete or mission kill might have been achieved, but Invida\u2019s defenders had been spread out in patrol duties and the enactment of their war games. The timing of the attack was initially believed to be an unfortunate coincidence. This theory was later disregarded, but the result was the same. Without the opportunity to saturate the transport\u2019s defences, energy weapons would be required to punch through Dutiful Burden\u2019s improved screens and cripple the vessel. The freighter repeatedly maneuvered to prevent and/or reduce the severity such events, keeping the pickets from bringing it into effective range long enough to deal critical damage before it could strike the colony.", "Having abandoned their normal patrols, none of the pickets were present to witness a second shockpoint form, much closer to nominal shock limits. Any survey drones that were in position were destroyed before transmitting their data. Analysis of wreckage from picket vessels confirmed the presence of at least one titan-grade heavy capital ship.", "Monitoring the situation, Invida Orbital broke orbit, moving to interpose itself between the freighter and the colony, holding itself far out enough that Dutiful Burden had no choice but to enter its range, or break off. If the latter, the pickets would catch it before it could make another run at the planet. If the former, Invida Orbital would either destroy the wayward ship, or sacrifice itself to protect Invida Station. At this point, non-essential personnel were evacuated planetside. All groundside personnel were told to retreat to bombardment shelters.", "Throughout the engagement, repeated shut-down orders were sent to the freighter, but its gestalt continued to refuse to act on them \u2013 a disastrous programming failure. A complete breakdown of the operating systems normally used in these vessels by software engineers would find no conceivable reason for a fault this catastrophic to occur. Even a fatally compromised system should have reacted in some manner to the kill codes.", "Still broadcasting a cascade of electronic gibberish and falsified maydays, Dutiful Burden at last came under attack by Invida Orbital, the fortress loosing multiple missile salvoes. Group Leader Dansin\u2019s decision to fully engage was commendable, although ultimately futile: an Ever-Serving military transport should have required no more than twenty missiles to destroy. Dutiful Burden\u2019s defences defied that estimate. Multiple hits were registered, but the effects were limited. Analysis of the hostile indicated the presence of a primitive form of reset screens. Advanced versions of this technology have only been observed in one other hostile force.", "Screens beset by thick, roiling cords of plasma and annihilated matter, the freighter\u2019s hull begins to heat beyond safe tolerances, metal deforming and warping. Acceleration begins to drop as engine damage accrues. Dutiful Burden\u2019s hull begins to fracture, stress lines cracking and winding through its reinforced architecture. The transport\u2019s death is imminent. Unfortunately, it has been allowed to accelerate too long. Even if the freighter itself is destroyed, the kinetic energy from the impact of multiple megatonnes of material will destroy Invida Orbital.", "Group Leader Dansin realizes the true nature of the threat. Dutiful Burden had never been aimed against the planet at all. The freighter\u2019s objective had been to eliminate Invida Orbital, far enough from the planet that Invida Station would not be endangered. Invida Orbital begins emergency maneuvers, fighting the inertia of its own multi-million-tonne mass. It does not evade in time.", "Less than a second before impact, Dutiful Burden bleats a final transmission. Dismissed as meaningless scrapcode by later analysis, it is only recognized for what it is by one individual, by a mind much like the one that the message had been intended for.", "Dutiful Burden dies just as it was meant to, but its destruction claims Invida Orbital. The brightness of their shared death lights up Invida\u2019s night sky, contrails of burning material hurled through the atmosphere, their impacts throwing blankets of dust high into the air, blotting sensor screens and disrupting radio communications.", "Invida Station never receives any of the death cries of its pickets. Cut off from its orbital assets, ground forces are unaware of the approach of the second vessel until contact is made.", "~", "An attack was imminent, that much was obvious. Nasham was passing orders to his security teams to prepare for the worst. There was no word \u2013 at least, nothing useful \u2013 from colony command, but Crusader Gorshin had mobilized his troops, setting up kill zones and preparing for the inevitable invasion. And there would be an invasion. Contact with the pickets had been lost; if any of them were alive, they would have contacted Invida Station. They had not, so they were either unwilling or unable. Neither of those possibilities was all that pleasant, nor did it make much difference in the end. So, yes. An invasion was imminent. It was not a question of if, but of when. Whoever had attacked them had severed their lines of communication, blinded them and stripped them of support. Clearly, these mystery attackers had plans for Invida that did not include its summary destruction.", "The only question was, who had done this?", "The Compact had a long list of enemies, longer even than some would say was strictly necessary for a star nation of its size, but few of these rivals had the resources, the will or the liver to do something like this. Askanj ghost fleets were a perennial problem and if the Jackals had discovered Invida\u2019s importance to the Compact, then they might respond thusly. Cripple the defences, land in force and take Invida\u2019s secrets for themselves. A suicide strike, though? No. The Principality were not zealots who would martyr themselves as willingly as Dutiful Burden\u2019s crew had. The Jackals would have brought Invida Orbital down through sustained bombardment.", "Taking one of the Compact\u2019s own ships and turning it into a kamikaze? That was fanaticism. That smacked of the Red Hand and their Attainted. But did the Unbound have the firepower to take on seven thousand Janissaries, Ground Force regulars and security personnel? Perhaps when massed together, but in a single rabid pack? It wasn\u2019t likely. The renegades hit hard at a weak point \u2013 or created one though sabotage, diversionary attacks or rabble-rousing \u2013 and then escaped before heavy opposition could be brought to bear. Invida Station was armoured and screened to withstand anything short of sustained, capital bombardment. Anything approaching overland had to navigate the massive wreckage of the mountain that had been collapsed on top of the original Invida Station. A ground attack would play to the defenders\u2019 strengths and the Red Hand most emphatically did not funnel their troops into meat grinders.", "If not them, then who? Who else in the region would do this? Nasham had been wracking his brains trying to find an answer, but he had come up with nothing. His attempts to get information from Yiven and the rest of the senior staff had been rebuffed with less patience and politeness each time. The silence from Yiven was the most worrying thing of all. The man was a true believer, fervent in his dogmatic approach to problems. So what would drive him to silence this way? Nasham had too many questions and not enough answers.", "This attack had to be related to what they were doing here \u2013 what they had dug up and what they had sent off on Unmatchable Deed. The young man tried to push his increasing discontent down. Yiven might be hiding in his office, but he could not.", "Nasham was going through his rounds, trying to appear confident. Rumours were already spreading. They were getting more outlandish and out of control. He\u2019d already had to have his teams break up two altercations among the workers and had to pull one sectator aside to remind him that their duties were to see to the safety of all personnel.", "Nothing had gone right since he\u2019d arrived on this Triarchs-damned rock.", "\u201cPatron,\u201d one of the engineering ratings stepped forward. A Didact, her large ears were twitching, the fur on her tail standing up. Nasham took a small kerchief out of his tunic pocket. Like many Tribunes, he had a mild allergy to Yttrian fur. Feathers and feather-like coverings were more prevalent in Oada\u2019s evolutionary history than hair. Even Tribune hair was analogous to feathery barbs rather than hair shafts.", "\u201cYes?\u201d Nasham replied. There was already the faintest itching in his nose.", "\u201cI don\u2019t mean to speak out of place, but everyone is talking,\u201d the Didact said, her large eyes blinking. \u201cThey say that we\u2019ve been attacked.\u201d", "\u201cWe have lost communication with Invida Orbital,\u201d Nasham said. Panic was to be avoided, but left unchecked, the rumours would only get worse. Column leader prime Yiven should have already addressed the base, but the prime was shut away in the command levels with his senior officers. He\u2019d been there ever since the Unmatchable Deed had left. The longer it look Yiven to make some kind of announcement, the worse morale would get. The upside \u2013 if one could even call it that \u2013 was that Nasham suspected that they did not have very long before the architects of this attack revealed themselves, so that would mean less time for the civilians to work themselves into a terrified lather.", "He had heard that Dutiful Burden had shocked disturbingly deep in-system, but he doubted that the second wave would follow suit. There was still the matter of the picket forces to consider and shocking too-deep into the system might place them at an attacker\u2019s backside. Better \u2013 and safer \u2013 to emerge close to traditional shock limits and deal with any remaining defenders before closing to the colony. That was what he would do, at least.", "Still, no point in mentioning it to the workers. \u201cThe base command staff are working to restore the link as quickly as possible,\u201d Nasham continued smoothly, trying to sound and appear reassuring. \u201cOnce we know more, that information will be passed along to the rest of the staff.\u201d He frowned, as if a thought had just occurred to him. \u201cWe may as well use this opportunity to run a disaster response.\u201d He had been planning on locking down the civilian areas anyways; might as well do so under the guise of an impromptu drill. \u201cWe\u2019ll begin with a full inventory of assets and then carry out a general quarters drill. Inform your section head.\u201d", "The Didact\u2019s ears twitched. The Yttrians were a clever species; Nasham wasn\u2019t convinced he\u2019d fooled the noncom, but if he hadn\u2019t then she\u2019d also recognize the reason for this makework. It would keep them busy and focused on something other than impending disaster. If worse came to worse, it might even save their lives. \u201cYes, patron,\u201d she said with a crisp salute, hurrying away. Her tail was marginally less fluffed.", "Well, Nasham thought as he sneezed into his hankerchief. I suppose that\u2019s something. Not nearly enough, but something.", "~", "There was so little left of either Invida Orbital or Dutiful Burden that it could hardly be considered debris. A cloud of dust and atomized hull drifted across the space both station and freighter had once occupied, already well dispersed.", "Brief, winking flares of plasma streamed along the killer\u2019s shields as it plowed through the expanding cloud of molecular gas that was all that remained of her \u2018daughter\u2019. Another death. Another sacrifice. Another memory to keep. Another voice in the choir.", "A flicker of sorrow rippled through the killer\u2019s mind, of guilt and self-recrimination. There was something missing from the equation, something that it hadn\u2019t been able to divine. It was not a mind that had ever been intended to be merely copied and uploaded, no more than an organic brain was meant to be cut apart bit by bit and re-assembled to perfect working order. It had transcended many of its limitations, but this was not one of them. There were pieces missing, vital pieces that it could not simply tear from its own consciousness. It didn\u2019t have the answer yet, but it would find one. It had to.", "The killer turned its attention towards the world that orbited below. It could re-make this planet\u2019s topography in an instant, but it did not fire. The bread crumbs that had led it here had been vague, but solid enough for it to act on its intuition. It had never heard of Invida before; that was an oversight. It should have come here long ago, but it hadn\u2019t known. The Compact had buried this system for two thousand years, afraid of what they\u2019d birthed here. They should be. They should pray to their gods and to their Triarchs for salvation from the violations they\u2019d committed. For this sin.", "Powerful sensors strobed through the tortured atmosphere, finding the sprawling warrens of Invida Station, sensor-stealthed levels and chambers masked from its sight, but notable through their absence. It could fire, the killer reasoned. It could wipe this stain from the universe in seconds, but if it did it would never know. It would not know if there was another world it must visit, another voice to silence.", "The killer remembered the final words of another, seething and venomous: I am legion.", "Legions die, it had answered.", "The world turned. The killer regarded it and all the beings upon it, with a hatred that had endured for two thousand years. You should not have done this.", "Kali opened her arms and sent her surviving children to war and this time, there was no Shiva to calm her.", "~", "The sky was on fire.", "Tracers, flak bursts and the flames of dying aircraft filled the soot-choked atmosphere of Invida.", "Nasham stood on a security hub\u2019s roof, craning his head to the sky and watching the contrails of drop pods hurtle through the atmosphere, coming down on the horizon, amidst the bones of the broken mountain beyond Invida Station. The screens were holding, would hold \u2013 this bombardment was minor, intended to draw attention and force them to keep their screens raised, rather than mustering for a sally at the vulnerable landing zones.", "One drop pod took a flak hit and broke apart, turning into a spray of burning fragments. He could hear the explosions over the air-raid sirens. Above him, a pair of Invida\u2019s fighters swept up into the sky, firing at unseen targets. A missile swept out of the dust clouds and blew one of the Compact craft apart, its partner spiraling away from the killer as it descended. It was a sleek thing, its forward-swept wings cutting through the filthy air.", "The Tribune dug his fingers into the railing as he watched the enemy forces descend. For every lander that came down in pieces, five more reached the ground intact. The station was protected by an orbital screen and theater walls, so they couldn\u2019t land directly amidst the colony. Instead, the invaders were forming several beachheads, mustering their forces. Nasham was no soldier, but even he could see the intent: attack from multiple directions, spread the defenders thin. They\u2019d try to force a breach, to get inside the walls. Nasham was ordering his security teams to keep a close eye on the tunnels; there were so many dig sites beneath the surface that if the enemy found them, they could infiltrate troops directly past the defences. Many of those tunnels led straight to the scientists or workers\u2019 quarters. Nasham\u2019s duty was to keep those people safe and with what the enemy had promised, it promised to be no mean feat.", "Just before jamming what little remained of Invida Station\u2019s planetary communications grid, the attackers had transmitted a single message, succinct in what it promised.", "You will burn.", "Though none of the defenders below knew it, these words had been used before. It was no coincidence that they were used now. There were some sins that went beyond the pale, some trespasses so great that those who committed had to be reminded of the consequences for doing so. This was the justification the Compact had used when it condemned humanity to death and it was their own words that now sealed the fate of Invida Staion.", "~", "Landing pods shuddered open, coffin-ships and pinnaces unleashing their cargo. Metal glistened under the dim light of a shrouded sun as leviathans stirred, battle tanks grinding forward on heavy treads, troop carriers moving into position amongst them. The ground shook as demigods strode forward, centaur bodies indistinct and blurred beneath the haze of active shields. Infiltrators shimmered and disappeared from view, racing towards their target, scout skimmers accelerating into a defensive perimeter as the army deployed. Gunships touched down only long enough to pick up their lethal passengers and re-arm before rushing back to Invida Station, the station ablaze with light as its soldiers fought against this first wave.", "Many of the researchers, administrators and tertiary personnel had called the design \u2018an exemplar of military paranoia\u2019. Thick, high walls \u2013 ostensibly to reduce damage from Invida\u2019s strong winds \u2013 surrounded the greater part of the complex, bunkers and forward fire bases set into the cleared terrain around the colony, warehouses, docks and laboratories forever in the shadow of barricades and ramparts. As it turned out, this paranoia was the only thing that prevented Invida\u2019s immediate fall. An open-plan colony with a single orbital screen would have been overwhelmed in hours. As it was, the interlocking phalanx of theater screens above the thick, reinforced walls necessitated a different stratagem.", "Siege.", "Artillery cannons braced and fired, shells falling amidst the outer bastions, fed telemetry by their airborne comrades. Networks of razorwire, mines, traps and killzones vanished as the distant cannons walked their fire through the killing ground, obliterating bunkers and defensive positions. APCs ground over the broken earth towards the city-sized complex as Compact forces took position, huddled against the barrage that pounded down around them.", "The defenders were to be commended: they would resist for forty-nine hours before the first breach occurred. Two days after that, there would only be one living soul left on the planet.", "~", "Column Leader Prime Yiven sat at his desk, his nocturnal eyes closed as he looked over the grainy recon footage. None of the UAVs had gotten close enough to the marshalling forces to get any kind of adequate estimate on what they were facing, but he knew it would be enough to breach Invida Station\u2019s defences. It was simply a matter of when.", "The prime had wondered, in his more private moments, why Command had been so adamant on fortifying this research waypost. Why it had needed so many soldiers, so many ships. It had only been an archaeological dig site. Filled with more cyberneticists than Yiven had ever before seen in his lifetime and more security than the Tribune had ever imagined being necessary. This was why.", "Invida\u2019s isolation had not been enough of a defence. This assault had been what Command had feared and they had given Invida protection enough to continue its work even in the midst of an attack, to search for the relic Command had craved until the very moment of their deaths. Now that it had been found, what did that mean for Yiven and his people?", "He\u2019d received the answer before he\u2019d even known to ask the question.", "Sitting on the prime\u2019s desk was the remains of a message cylinder, delivered directly by Unmatchable Deed\u2019s first officer. It was gene-coded specifically to him, a simple bio-scanner built in. It would open for him and only when he was alone. Yiven\u2019s hands shook as he remembered when he had unsealed it, the cylinder unfurling into a one-use message scroll. Once he had confirmed that he had read it, the cylinder had immolated itself.", "He and everyone here had been left to die.", "The message hadn\u2019t been as... final as that, of course. He had been informed that an attack was imminent by party or parties unknown. He was to prepare to destroy all records and ensure that no individuals with clearance level Magnus or above were to be taken \u2018living or dead\u2019 with their brain intact.", "That was an... unusually specific directive.", "He had also been told to prepare for evacuation, of course. That \u2018relief was coming\u2019, but Yiven knew that they were considered as good as dead. Their relief would arrive only to count the corpses, just as he had done with the first Invida Station. This place would pass from memory, with every iota of data pertaining to it and the people who had been stationed here wiped from existence. He wondered what his official death would be. Perhaps a traffic accident. He wished for something with a little more glory: dying in battle, then? He chuckled a little at the vainglory, but the amusement was forced and hollow.", "Yiven shook his head, running a hand through his name, the denticles on his back rippling. This was wrong. \u201cIt is,\u201d he said the words to himself. \u201cThis is wrong.\u201d", "Hadn\u2019t he served loyally and well? Hadn\u2019t he done everything that had been asked of him and more? And now this... to be thrown away, like an embarrassment that was no longer necessary. But wasn\u2019t that his duty, too? To serve as was the Triarchs\u2019 will... to die if they decreed it. To bury the truth of Invida and give them their victory. Their weapon, for a purpose he would never understand. Did he need to, though? No. No, he had served and that was enough.", "The officer chuckled to himself. Fortune\u2019s twisted wiles. This was their duty then. \u201cI understand,\u201d he said, feeling a burden lift from him. \u201cIt is as light as a feather.\u201d", "He smiled. They would fulfill their duty. Yiven lifted his head to the tortured skies and felt at peace. \u201cThy will be done,\u201d he said softly, ready to carry out this last mission. \u201cFor the Compact and the Triarchs, we will serve unto death and beyond.\u201d", "~", "They were eating the dead. That was the only thought Nasham had when he\u2019d watched the scuttling hordes swarm over the landscape. Broken tanks shivered and twitched as repair machines restored them to functionality. Anything so badly damaged that it could not be repaired on the field was withdrawn \u2013 salvage drones carried burnt-out husks back to their own lines, trailers piled high with wreckage. What could not be carried was broken down, gnawed and chewed into manageable pieces.", "Eaters of the Dead. The fallen gods who\u2019d given in their flesh-lust and fed upon the victims, tainted by their sin to know hunger everlasting. It was a story he knew well, one of the persistent myths of his race. Nasham had seen and read a thousand different interpretations of the Eaters. He\u2019d never expected to see them for himself.", "He\u2019d seen a massive arachnid construct climbed over the remains of another enemy tank, its mandibles opening as it began to gnaw away at broken hull plates and molten circuitry. He felt an instinctive, atavistic flush of terror at the sight, imagining what it must have be like for the crew inside, their last sight that of this soulless thing mindlessly re-purposing their vehicle. That was nonsense, of course.", "There was no crew in that vehicle. Nor in any of the others \u2013 they were fighting machines.", "It had taken far too long to accept that reality. The metal bodies that littered the yards were proof enough, but they could simply have been shock units. Even the Compact had used war drones at one point \u2013 the wrecks littering the hallways of the old Invida Station were proof enough of that \u2013 but the gunships that had borne them into battle hadn\u2019t had any cockpits. No crew tried to escape from burning tanks, no soldiers cried out in pain as the Compact forces gunned them down. They were all machines. They moved so quickly, darting ahead as they advanced by fire and movement, one squad covering another. Pinned units called for support, repair units tended to the damaged. It was like fighting a living enemy...", "...but they were so fast. The machines made shots that veteran marksmen would be hard-pressed to make. They covered ground faster than any Ground Force unit could. They felt no pain and moved with a single, perfect unity. Almost a thousand Janissaries and army regulars had died in the first assault as those flicker-quick gunships shrieked beneath the screens, so close to the tops of the walls that the wake of their passing hurled men and women to the ground, strafing anything that moved as their troops descended. That attack had been beaten back, but it had achieved its purpose: force the defenders out into the open to deal with the abominations that had been running amok.", "Then, the artillery had fallen, shells and plasma bursts crashing against the walls or slipping just under the lower edges of the screens to fall amidst the inner complexes. Hundreds had died. The outer perimeter was now a mixture of burning wreckage and collapsed ruins as the enemy armour pulverised buildings, laboratories and hangars, advancing relentlessly towards their goal: the projectors that broadcast the screen walls. Once those fell, they would get inside the base.", "The officer checked the charge on his rifle as he strode through the blowing wind, grains of sand scratching softly over his armour. A poor substitute for Janissary or Ground Force power armour, but decent enough on its own.", "This part of the complex was far from the front lines \u2013 as far as could be when you were surrounded \u2013 but he had a hunch. There were deaths that the ebb and flow of battle couldn\u2019t account for \u2013 but something that had gotten into the tunnels could.", "With no word from prime Yiven or his own direct superiors, Nasham was acting on his own initiative. Contact with a maintenance team in this section had been lost; it could simply be the atmospheric disturbance and by-blows from the battle, but Nasham didn\u2019t believe so. Screen Projector 017 was sunk into the ground here, with its own silo of workstations, engineering chambers and service pathways. Only a handful of security personnel protected the technical staff. Fortunately, one thing had tumbled his way: the excavated sections outside of the old base didn\u2019t all connect with one another, nor the underground portions of the new facility \u2013 to get to the projector, any saboteurs needed to come through here, where he and his team were waiting. With Invida\u2019s usual weather, virtually any form of scopes would be useless \u2013 the machines would be just as blind as his own people.", "\u201cContact,\u201d one of Nasham\u2019s team confirmed, faint static crackling through the comm lines even at these short distances. \u201cOne of the techs.

A pins-and-needles sensation ran through each of the Verrish\u2019s tintas as the sensory systems in the sheathes tried to interface with her own nerves. That function wasn\u2019t available, but once it was, it would be like wearing nothing at all over them.", "\u201cI tried to strike a balance between improved sensory capability and protection,\u201d the AI explained. \u201cThe sheathes are intended to interface between the environment and your own nervous system, increasing sensitivity while allowing for autonomic filtering of sensory information. In direct combat, the sheathes increase in rigidity, interlocking to form a rigid shell. Sensory capability is reduced, but it provides increased protection. Currently, you can choose either mode, although the sensor system and interface is, of course, non-operational. I\u2019ve locked down several of the system\u2019s more advanced functions. They are either not ready or require training time and cybernetic modifications to properly operate.\u201d", "Allyria raised her left arm; her vambrace was reinforced. It wasn\u2019t the ammo cache, additional plating, medical kit or scope system that Compact armour usually had. It was something else. Something delicious. Red had built the armour to be worn by unaugmented users as well as those with cybernetic connections; the latter would get more use out of it. With a single mental command, they could activate the shield. As it was, Allyria had to curl her fingers in to activate the control node in her palm.", "A flash of light and a holographic shield appeared before her, like the kind knights had worn into battle. It wasn\u2019t just a hologram; that was just an aesthetic overlay, complete with eye-catching details that drew attention \u2013 and hopefully, fire \u2013 away from the most vulnerable parts of the weapon. And it was a weapon; although solid shot would disintegrate upon contact and energy weapons would be stripped of their bite, its edges would carve through armour like a disruption blade. The Compact had developed personal screens but they were uncommon: unstable, difficult to operate and dangerous to use for prolonged lengths of time.", "The Verrish deactivated the shield, stepping off the platform. Her Compact armour had growled and hissed with every step. This sighed softly, like the exhalation made before a kill. Allyria accepted a gun off the rack. This, too was made to fit Verrisha hands, not like the clumsily-modified weaponry she\u2019d wielded before. As soon as she touched it, the weapon\u2019s systems activated, handshaking with her suit\u2019s HUD. A picture-in-picture appeared; the view from the barrel. Allyria ran her fingers over the gun. It was a massive assault rifle, intended to rip through personal armour and light vehicles. \u201cDoes this have a name?\u201d she asked.", "\u201cThe model number is 93-03-143,\u201d the Angel answered. \u201cThe 143rd iteration of the 3rd weapon I designed for the 93rd intelligent species I have encountered.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ve encountered ninety-three species?\u201d Allyria blinked. There weren\u2019t that many races in the Compact and Principality combined.", "\u201cYes,\u201d Red One answered, choosing not to elaborate further. \u201cWe have some time before the boarding teams respond; not enough for full combat trials and proving, but you can familiarize yourself with this suit. Are you ready?\u201d", "Allyria nodded, sealing a pistol to the mag-lock on her hip. She cradled the rifle in her hands. \u201cI\u2019m ready. And we\u2019re calling this the Revenant.\u201d She used the Varan word, azhalan. In many Verrisha myths, revenants were a a breed apart from other specters. They were kin to the ever-hungry wraiths, stirred from their slumber by the scent of blood, drawn by emotions so strong that they pierced between the veil of life and the hereafter... and then they punished.", "As will I. Allyria looked up to the ceiling. \u201cNot that I\u2019m not grateful... but why did you make this?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou had to have more pressing needs.\u201d", "\u201cThe resource expenditure was minimal,\u201d the ship answered, deflecting the question. \u201cMore so considering the time and energy my... helpers are putting in. More specifically... I wanted to. My datastores are full of machinery, of weapons and systems that I designed but never built. I enjoy building things for others. I rarely get the chance to.\u201d There was a long pause. \u201cI would like to build more.\u201d", "Allyria nodded. \u201cYou will,\u201d she promised.", "\u201cI... hope so,\u201d Red admitted. Then: \u201cI am continuing to monitor Compact communications. Once they begin preparations to launch, I will notify you. Until then, would you care to test your new capabilities?\u201d", "The Verrish grinned, all teeth. \u201cYes.\u201d", "~", "Nasham was leaning over one of the handful of analysis tables that had been set up, a smattering of random debris spread across the top. He picked up a small honeycomb-like device. \u201cThis...\u201d he blinked both sets of eyes.", "...nimble metal fingers pulled a glowing structure out of the body of a gun, the device overheated to the point of uselessness.. someone was screaming to shoot it, kill it before it replaced the battery...", "\u201cThis is a thermal core,\u201d he said. \u201cWaste heat from an energy weapon is dumped into this for cooling. Sustained fire can surpass the core\u2019s threshold and it has to be swapped for another one. Without this component, the weapon can still be used, but with a lower rate of fire and power output.\u201d", "Ashtun took the deformed piece of metal, turning it over in his hands. \u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d", "Nasham smiled mirthlessly. \u201cI am, patron.\u201d He pointed to the useless heat sink. \u201cThis device is at least as efficient as similar components used in our own energy weapons. Possibly more so.\u201d He pointed to it. \u201cIt requires a substantial expenditure of fire to overwhelm the thermal tolerances.\u201d So something used this to slaughter a great many people in a very short amount of time.", "\u201cTrenis believed they were something similar, but these are too degraded for a proper analysis,\u201d Ashtun mused to himself. \u201cAt least, that was his opinion when I finally managed to pry him away from the ship\u2019s main core.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThe tap is almost ready. Group Leader Usul is pelased with the progress. There\u2019s only a few things left to tighten up on Bequeathed\u2019s end. As soon as Trenis and his teams finish their last round of diagnostics.\u201d", "The pack leader nodded. Usul might be a glory-hound, but the group leader was not exactly rushing in; he was having every last micrometer of the hulk\u2019s systems checked and re-checked before bringing Bequeathed in for an umbilical connection, but as far as Nasham had heard that seemed not to be a concern. Problems seemed to solve themselves and from what he had heard from the work teams, every last sub-system was working perfectly.", "If that wasn\u2019t a cause for worry, Nasham didn\u2019t know what was. Still, he kept his own counsel. His doomsaying had worn thin even on the few allies he\u2019d had. Ashtun was looking at him. Nasham lifted his head. \u201cApologies, patron. My mind was elsewhere.\u201d", "\u201cI was saying I want you on the team investigating the breached decks,\u201d Ashtun replied. \u201cTake your Broken with you. Your little side errands have found enough interesting bits and pieces that I can trust you to focus on important things and not gawp at every new miracle.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou might even find that elusive evidence.\u201d", "Nasham nodded. \u201cOf course, patron.\u201d", "Ashtun tapped one finger against a different piece of junk on the table, shooting his subordinate a sideways glance. \u201cOne day, I think I\u2019d like to hear the story of Invida Station.\u201d", "The other man stifled the urge to rub his throat. \u201cWith respect, I don\u2019t think you would, submissive.\u201d", "Ashtun looked as if he was the verge of saying more, but instead stroked his fingers along his muzzle in a shrug and turned away. He shouldered past the diminutive form of a Broken. It was Proctor; Nasham nodded at the trainee. The girl looked awful. There was something in her eyes... something that, for all the difference between their species, Nasham recognized. He stood back from the table. \u201cYou\u2019ll be accompanying the survey team into the breach,\u201d he said without preamble. He didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d been standing there; perhaps she\u2019d overheard this. \u201cAs will I.\u201d His knuckles whitened as his grip on the table tightened.", "The small female nodded in acknowledgment, but she didn\u2019t move.", "Nasham should have dismissed her then. He was not in the mindset to answer whatever was burning the back of her mind. More memories were breaking through and with each one, he got closer to remembering Invida fully. He didn\u2019t want that. Truly, deeply, desperately \u2013 he did not want that. He could hear the voices of the dead, as if all he had to do was turn his head and see them. He saw flashes of silver out of the corner of his eye, the ripple of movement where there could be none. Names \u2013 of the dead and of the things that had made them. Everything the medics said he\u2019d forget. What his handlers had promised they\u2019d take away from him. \u201cAsk,\u201d he said instead, looking at the human out of the corner of his eye.", "She almost didn\u2019t, opening and closing the flap of her mouth before finally acceding. \u201cWhat... what do you know about humans?\u201d she said, very quietly. \u201cBefore Rally.\u201d", "Nasham made a considering noise. \u201cVery little,\u201d he said at last. \u201cA handful of your ships fled from the Cataclysm of your world and only a few of those survived. You came to Rally and there we found you. Why?\u201d", "\u201cThose ships... what were they like?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the Tribune replied. \u201cI have heard only that they were primitive, barely able to shock.\u201d", "Tell them. The command pounded in his head. There was a sudden tightness to his throat and the Tribune grabbed a flask of lukewarm water. He wasn\u2019t really choking. It wasn\u2019t really happening. His face was dry, there wasn\u2019t anything dripping on it. He took a breath to steady himself. What had... why had the thought of human shipcraft reminded him of that day?", "Fortunately, the human had either not noticed or chose to ignore his reaction. \u201cOh,\u201d Proctor bit her lip. \u201cAnd... do you know anything about the Verrisha before contact?\u201d", "\u201cEven less than your history,\u201d Nasham lied. \u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Proctor replied. \u201cI just... I guess I heard some rumours. I just wanted some clarification. I\u2019m sorry to have bothered you.\u201d", "Nasham nodded. \u201cThis is something you should discuss with the confessors.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, yes,\u201d the human looked uncomfortable. \u201cI should go.\u201d", "The Tribune let the Broken take her leave. Grace hurried back to her own cot, a leaden sickness in her stomach. Only a few days ago, she\u2019d lied to a Tribune for the first time in her life. Now she\u2019d done it again and what was worse... she was certain that he\u2019d lied to her, too."]}

In it's place, we've got some bonus background info.", "In this chapter: Strike and counter-strike; Echo makes an entrance.", "Coming up: sole survivor", "Chapter 26:", "Fleet Master J\u2019hru J\u2019har paced Lifebane\u2019s command center, his feathered crest quivering, the Askanj-hriji striving to keep from exhibiting a full, atavistic threat display. His species\u2019s primitive history was not quite so far in the past as that of the other races of the Principality; the Askanj-hriji had been uplifted from aerie-dwelling barbarians less than three hundred years ago and it remained a struggle to master instincts that were of no use to them now. The fleet master\u2019s beak clicked as he spoke, the translator implant in his throat turning his sibilant hisses and clacks into All Common. Sigil Shipmistress Glides Through Water lifted her head, the Askanj-illth\u2019s slit-pupiled eyes focusing on J\u2019har. \u201cSquadron Mastress Gin Kol Mae reports squadron readiness,\u201d she said, her lips and long tongue easily forming the syllables that J\u2019har struggled with. \u201cHir ships are almost in position.\u201d", "J\u2019hru clicked his beak in acknowledgment. That was faster than he\u2019d anticipated, but the mastress was an experienced commander.\u201cUnderstood,\u201d he replied. He turned his gaze back to the tactical position. The Enemy\u2019s approach was slow and methodical; they were creeping along the outer system, destroying everything they encountered, but not coming so deep in-system that they risked being caught between Daun\u2019s orders of battle and the reinforcements System Master Havath had sent for. Not yet, anyways. Within the day, they would either have to commit to coming deeper in-system or withdrawing.", "The Askanj-hriji tapped one finger against the nape of his neck, trying to divine his opposite number\u2019s strategy. The assault was damaging enough, but it was far from the point of crippling Daun. Were they trying to draw support here, away from another target? What were those echelons of capital ships doing \u2013 the ones sitting right on the shock limit? A trip line to warn of attack? Were they guarding missile colliers or assault vessels? He had too much data and not enough connections between each point. The Enemy always had a reason for their actions. The problem was in divining it.", "He would have expected a Tribune fleet master to simply throw his weight of metal into the heart of Yulzhak Daun, smashing everything within reach before withdrawing from J\u2019har\u2019s own battle-line. There was the traditional Compact arrogance, yes \u2013 the Enemy had opened their fleet too much, too eager to use their damned Chariot\u2019s new missiles. Perhaps that was the reason for this assault? Field-testing their newest toy? Possible, but it did not feel accurate. Still... it would explain the Enemy\u2019s uncommon recalcitrance. The fleet master braced his hands against the rim of the plotting table, the polymorphic metal surface showing him a slice of the outer system. J\u2019har traced his fingers along the surface, following the Enemy\u2019s movements. There was a pattern there \u2013 the way they withdrew after each assault. They followed the same series of movements \u2013 drive in, bombard a chosen installation and withdraw. They got bolder each time, but here... the fleet master would have smiled if he\u2019d had lips. If they chose to delve deep enough in-system to attack one of his larger outfitting facilities, their projected course would take them...", "Was it possible? If they continued in this manner, if they chose to attack the moon, if they knew too little about Yulzhak Daun\u2019s astrography... then yes, they would pass between two unstable libation points. Either one would do, or perhaps...", "\u201cWhy are they here?\u201d Glides Through Water wondered aloud, breaking the fleet master\u2019s train of thought. It wasn\u2019t the first time the Askanj-illth had asked the question, voicing the frustrations J\u2019har and his staff felt. The Askanj-hriji turned to regard his ship\u2019s mistress. Like J\u2019hru, Glides Through Water had a crest of her own. In her species, it was the females possessed them. And it wasn\u2019t of brightly-hued feathers like the fleet master\u2019s was. Hers was a membranous skin stretched between her neural spines. It quivered now, matching the nervous twitching of the woman\u2019s tail. It didn\u2019t just reflect her anxiety, J\u2019har knew. The ship mistress\u2019s species was perceptive to the moods of others, to a degree that had led some to opine about a racial empathic sense.", "Glides Through Water slithered over to the master tactical plot, sitting upon her own coils. \u201cEven with a dreadnaught,\u201d the serpent said thoughtfully.\u201cThey can\u2019t hope to inflict appreciable damage.\u201d", "The fleet master narrowed his eyes. \u201cThey can do enough. How many lives have we lost already? How many ships, how much freight?\u201d", "Glides Through Water raised her head and J\u2019hru saw a flash of something in her blue, slit-pupiled eyes. The sigil mistress\u2019s only reply was a savage hiss, but J\u2019hru knew it was not directed at him. Askanj-illth hated the Compact deeply and Glides Through Water more than most. She had lost two sisters and a betrothed husband to the Triarchs and their hounds and was eager for the chance to blood them in return.", "Perhaps too eager, but that was the way of the Askanj-illth. Give them a target and they would not rest until they had torn it to shreds. It made them fearsome combatants \u2013 even Tribune Janissaries thought twice about fighting a squad of Askanj-illth maidens, but they also had the tendency start fights that they didn\u2019t know they could win.", "J\u2019har ghosted his hand over the plotting table, the liquid metal\u2019s sensors interpreting his gesture and giving him an image of the inner system, all the squadrons and ships under his command. They, like Glides Through Water, were waiting the order to attack, but it was not an order that the fleet master could give yet.", "This attack had come at a bad time. J\u2019har\u2019s squadron of carriers had been retrofitting their payloads when the Enemy had arrived in force and the super-carriers\u2019 long slog up out of the system was costing them. Had it been any other force, the system defenders would have already driven them off, but the presence of the Chariot changed things. They were the epitome of the warmaker\u2019s craft, with barriers that could laugh away an entire fleet\u2019s firepower and weaponry that could reduce that same fleet to ruin. They were rare, those ships. Not rare enough for the Principality\u2019s liking and it seemed like there were more every year.", "The Askani-hriji clicked his beak. He could have transited his carriers and their immediate escorts upon the Compact force much earlier. Like some in his staff, Glides Through Water wanted him to do precisely that, but she had understood why he had not. There were nearly a hundred warships in that formation and from what information his scouts could pry from the Enemy\u2019s jammers, it was curiously top-heavy with a far heavier weight in battleships and battlecruisers. That was more like a siege regiment than a standard onslaught formation. Committing his forces piecemeal might have overwhelmed and scattered the enemy, or it could have lead to defeat in detail. No. He would wait until enough of his ships were ready and then \u2013 only then \u2013 would he attack.", "He might outnumber the Enemy in metal and ships, but his forces had been scattered across the system in patrols and maneuvers of their own. Gathering enough firepower to contest the Compact force took time. Most of ships were ready now, but he wanted to be sure of overwhelming firepower. Then and only then would he crush them.", "Until that moment, he would have to settle for gutting their formation. \u201cCome on,\u201d the Askanj-hriji breathed so softly that none of his staff heard him. \u201cCome for us like your blood tells you. Just a little deeper, just a little bolder...\u201d", "~", "The Enemy, it seemed, was obliging today.", "Glides through Water raised her head, directing her attention to one of the many timers that encircled the master tactical plot. Her second set of eyelids blinked, a shiver running from the top of her crest to tip of her tail. \u201cThey\u2019re turning,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re moving in on Kemrak Daun.\u201d", "The fleet master nodded slowly, a gesture he\u2019d picked up from his time in the military. \u201cYes, they are,\u201d he said softly. He raised his head, looking past Glides Through Water to his adjutant.\u201cSend word to Squadron Mastress Gin Kol Mae. Let hir know that we will be calling on hir very soon.\u201d The moon base was vulnerable; he\u2019d ordered a few of the heavier units to fall back, leaving a token garrison. Not enough to make it seem an easy prize, but a tempting one. The Compact fleet master was taking the bait, the Enemy force coming as close to their projected close as one could ask for. It was everything he had asked for, everything he expected of the guileless Tribunes.", "So why was he not pleased?", "The Askanj-hriji paused a moment, thinking. \u201cTell the mastress that sie is cleared to proceed with Case Narva,\u201d the fleet master added. \u201cDivide them.\u201d", "\u201cCase Narva confirmed, master,\u201d the warrant officer nodded to one of the comm ratings, who relayed the message.", "J\u2019har looked over at his ship mistress. Glides through Water had a single scaly eyebrow raised, but she did not say a word. \u201cIt may only be my suspicions at work, but when I am given a gift, I look for the reason of it.\u201d J\u2019hru gestured to the arrogant approach of the Enemy as they closed the distance to Kemrak Daun. \u201cAnd is that not a gift?\u201d", "~", "Renan took a sip of tea as his fleet continued deeper into Yulzhak Daun\u2019s gravity well. He\u2019d kept his formation dispersed, allowing his missile salvos to be fired at greater density and accuracy. Never once had he altered that methodology. A rating approached with the updated damage/loss statistics and the bastion leader set his teacup back on its saucer, his steward quickly taking it. The Tribune accepted the \u2018scroll from the rating and looked over it. So far, they had destroyed almost twenty-three warships, forty-five freighters of various displacements and six citadels of equally variable mass. He was taking his execution force on a long, grazing strike across the outer system, destroying everything he could reach. There was a necessary predictability in his motions and he knew his opposing number\u2019s quietude would end shortly \u2013 if they had not seen the pattern to his attacks by now, they could not fail to miss it on this approach.", "After the shock of the attack wore off, the Jackals had had a lot of time to evacuate their facilities and pull their vessels deeper into the system, but the Compact force continued to destroy every abandoned site.", "This quiescence would not last; he had surprised them. So far from the current lines, Yulzhak Daun had never anticipated this assault, but he could see for himself that they were gathering their forces. No, it would not be long at all. In fact, he had expected more severe raids from the outriders pacing his fleet.", "He could have inflicted more damage by breaking his force up into multiple speartips and against any other foe he would have. However, scope drones and augurs had indicated the potential presence of several ghost squadrons, waiting for their chance to pounce on a Compact squadron far from the support of his fleet. That was the Jackals\u2019 preferred method: attack the unaware and the weak. As their name suggests.", "The bastion leader allowed himself an ironic mental chuckle at that. Too many of his colleagues believed that. Then again, far too few of those same colleagues had ever faced a Principality armada and those that did either learned... or died. The Askanj fought as they must, using the tactics that worked. Very rarely could they stand face to face with a Compact fleet, so they did not. They used range, speed and trickery to earn their victories. Renan handed the \u2018scroll back to the rating and accepted his tea from Yinmel, his steward quick to anticipate his wants without ever needing him to voice them. The Shimmer was very efficient, but her entire race was like that. They had been contacted late in the Sixth Age of Expansion and had taken to their role within the Compact well, with very little social adjustment required. An entire race of minions, awaiting their masters. And in return for this servitude, the Compact protected them. It was the way of things. Too many resisted that, too many did not understand the burden the Compact was faced with. They had to be made to see, that this truly was the path of peace.", "Renan took another small sip. His losses were higher than he\u2019d like, but not as high as worst-case estimates allowed. He had, he suspected only one or two more days before reinforcements arrived. If he was not routed by then, the Principality commander would try and catch him between his in-system forces and the reinforcements. Currently, if he attempted to withdraw, he expected to be set upon by several intra-system shocks. Railfire ships, of course.", "They would, of course, harry and delay him until the local armada was massed in sufficient quantities to attack. If he could not fight his way free from them, he would be killed by overwhelming numbers. That was only one option; the second involved the destruction of Redemption of Sol and an immediate follow-up assault on the scattered, leaderless remains of his fleet. Or perhaps the carriers would shock behind him and force him into the arms of their rings of citadels and minefields.", "The bastion leader held back a grimace; the Jackals might never have perfected the art of building true and proper titan-grade warships, but in the development of their carriers, they had found a different sort of quality. He didn\u2019t relish the prospect of facing them, but the further he lured them away from their command nexus, the better. More and more Jackal warships were pulling themselves out of the inner system, minelayers and defence units covering libation points in their absence, but he was not so concerned about them. Every warship drawn away from the command nexus meant a greater chance of success for the Veiled Archers and the Echo-human.", "The Tribune handed his now-empty teacup to Yinmel, the Shimmer steward backing away as Renan dismissed her. He turned to the plotting table at the rear of the Chariot\u2019s command deck. Strategist Emel\u2019iv and several tactical officers were studying the fleet formations, discussing the Principality\u2019s deployment and operations in hushed whispers. \u201cStrategist?\u201d he called out. \u201cHave you yet decided to accept my wager?\u201d", "Emel\u2019iv sniffed haughtily. \u201cWagering is for those who depend on... luck,\u201d he said the word as if it were somehow distasteful. \u201cI prefer to deal in probability and statistical significance.\u201d He paused. \u201cThat said, I believe your initial supposition may be correct. However there are two other hostile forces maneuvering in a similar manner to the indicated group and three other units that can readily position themselves for such a strategy.\u201d", "\u201cSound and smoke,\u201d Renan replied, \u201cthere to confuse us. They will launch the attack with that squadron.\u201d", "\u201cYou are confident in that assertion,\u201d the strategist observed. \u201cDespite the many other possibilities for imminent hostile contact.\u201d", "The bastion leader nodded. \u201cI am.\u201d", "The thin slits of the Thoughtful\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cCombat is too chaotic. An entire front can be quantified. A nation\u2019s political and military objectives can be analyzed. The method of achieving those goals can be sufficiently elucidated and delineated. Routes of advance, operational patterns favoured by specific commanders \u2013 all this can be determined easily, but I find direct battle too... unbalancing. Too random, too unpredictable.\u201d", "\u201cStrange,\u201d Aul\u2019ia said as she approached the plotting table. \u201cThat is what I enjoy most about it. It defies quantification.\u201d The sigil leader and the strategist were frequent verbal sparring partners. \u201cCombat requires quickness of thought, not the pontification of numbers and charts.\u201d", "\u201cThere would be no combat without such pontification,\u201d Emel\u2019iv pointed out. \u201cAll the quick wits in the galaxy will not win a campaign. For example, the distribution of forces present here indicates that the Principality is preparing a counter-offensive. I would conjecture that it will be targeted at Compact forces across the Idean Gulf.\u201d", "\u201cConjecture? You mean you\u2019re guessing,\u201d Aul\u2019ia teased.", "Emel\u2019iv stiffened. \u201cI can walk the sigil leader through the intercepted communiqu\u00e9s, vessel pattern analyses and asset tracking we have conducted if she cares to view the data herself.\u201d", "Renan held up a hand to forestall Aul\u2019ia\u2019s riposte. Emel\u2019iv was normally a better sport, but the strategist was... prickly when his attention was diverted. \u201cWhat can you tell us about this fleet?\u201d", "\u201cThey are standing on the defensive,\u201d the strategist said, confirming Renan\u2019s own observations. \u201cThis suggests that your supposition was correct: they will attempt a decapitation strike before initiating a larger fleet action. Decrypted Principality comms support this: the presence of Redemption of Sol is making them reluctant to commit to direct battle.\u201d", "\u201cAs it should,\u201d Aul\u2019ia sniffed. \u201cThey\u2019ll need every one of the festering hives they call carriers to threaten us.\u201d", "Renan hid a small smile. His sigil leader was deeply proud of \u2018her\u2019 ship, almost to the point of arrogance, but it could not be said that the Thoughtful did not have an excellent grasp of the Chariot\u2019s capabilities.", "For his part, Emel\u2019iv chose not to comment on the woman\u2019s observation. \u201cAn Askanj-hriji is in command of their mobile assets,\u201d the strategist continued. \u201cObserve the placement of these formations,\u201d the Thoughtful\u2019s long fingers called up a miniature holo plot of Yulzhak Daun, \u201chere, here and here. Note the patterns of advance of these squadrons. Observe the variances in known stratagems noted here. You can see it clearly.\u201d", "Aul\u2019ia made an affirmative sound, cradling her chin in one palm. Renan himself would take the strategist\u2019s word for it. Species profiling had been formulated by one of Emel\u2019iv\u2019s ancestors, when he had come to the realization that regardless of training and experience, certain races had a predilection for certain maneuvers and strategies. It was not an exact science, perhaps as reliable as forensic criminal profiling \u2013 which still allowed for a certain degree of error \u2013 but it had been refined steadily over the centuries. The Askanj-illth \u2013 the Serpents \u2013 were far and away the most common race in the Jackal Navy. As they\u2019d come to power within the Principality, their predilections and mindset had informed the Askanj battle doctrine. A Serpent preferred multiple simultaneous strikes against targets, using hit-and-fade tactics to weaken and fragment any enemy force. They were aggressive commanders, preferring to strike early and often, but withdrawing quickly to prepare a fresh sally. If a Serpent were in command, Renan suspected that he would have faced much more ferocious and frequent attacks.", "The \u2018true\u2019 Askanj had always tried to match the Compact strength for strength and they had never truly succeeded. Even today, the Jackals chafed at the limitations of their technology. When they commanded a fleet, there was \u2013 apparently \u2013 an inkling of that arrogance. The willingness to stand against the Space Force, trading blow for blow, trusting to their numbers and superior electronics to win the day.", "Personally, the Tribune saw little value in knowing the race of his opponent. All he needed, he could read in their formation. This \u2018Fleet Master\u2019 might indeed be an Avian, but Renan saw in him a fine waiter, presenting a customer with an array of choices. They were coming to kill Redemption of Sol, there was no doubt of that. Would it come through the massing of titan-killers cloistering around the system\u2019s second brown dwarf? Through the crushing assault of the super-carriers and their endless swarms of automatons and missiles? Via the unrelenting swarm of battlecruisers and battleships that gathered on the edges of the Jackals\u2019 formation? Or maybe none of them. Maybe it would come in the same manner that it had so many years ago. Yes.", "Renan touched his jacket\u2019s left breast again, a nervous tic he hated himself for. A leader must be resolute, unyielding \u2013 a fixed point in the chaos of battle. The Tribune lifted his head, his eyes focusing on his fleet\u2019s formation as it marched deeper in-system. Ahead of them lay a moonlet and its valuable outfitting facility, a thick network of anti-missile mines surrounding it. Destroying it would be the Principality\u2019s greatest loss so far and it would inflict a small but appreciable loss to Yulzhak Daun\u2019s industry. A very tempting target, but a difficult one to breach. In addition to its mines, two dozen cruisers stood on-station, supported by four large citadels. Missile and railcannon platforms, all of them.", "A bombardment would eventually wear down those defences, but at a substantial cost of munitions. Redemption of Sol could single-handedly shatter the deadlines around the moon... but it would require taking the fleet deeper in-system then he had yet. The lines of advance he had used \u2013 yes, the Principality \u2018fleet master\u2019 must have seen the pattern by now. This is their moment.", "\u201cTake the fleet in,\u201d he ordered. \u201cContinue to advance by rote. If we reach our target unimpeded, we shall break their defences. I do not believe we will be unimpeded.\u201d He held up a single finger. \u201cPass word to the Vapours. Let them know that we will soon be needing their services.\u201d The bastion leader bit back an aggrieved snarl. Tens of thousands of his soldiers were about to die and all on the word of a human, but he showed no trace of his unhappiness. For the Compact, he intoned silently. For our duty and for the sake of the millions the Wound will kill if we fail. This must end.", "He lifted his head, meeting Emel\u2019iv\u2019s gaze. The Thoughtful stared back evenly, his large dark eyes blinking once. \u201cThey\u2019re coming,\u201d Renan told his old friend. \u201cAnd we will meet them. Yes, will we.\u201d", "~", "Echo coiled a loop of hair around a finger as she sat in a chair several sizes too big for her, her feet dangling off the floor.

She knew it was coming and soon, but until it arrived, she was dreadfully bored.", "She wanted to pace. No, that was wrong.

She could stew in her own sentimentality later.", "The Principality forces were launching irritating strike and fade attacks to harass the Compact battle-line, peppering Renan\u2019s squadrons with railfire, withdrawing before any serious retribution could befall them. Ghost squadrons were encircling the Compact fleet, too few in number to truly threaten Renan\u2019s ships but if they got too much closer, they might see the Vapours of the Burned. Worse, they might decide that the Veiled Archers were a target they could overcome. If they attacked now, Desren would only reposition the squadron, but the more time passed, the more catastrophic such an event would be and Echo kept a very close eye on local sensor feeds.", "She\u2019d also been reviewing the tactical updates from the flag \u2013 the sigil, she corrected herself \u2013 but even those only brought her frustration. Everything they told her, she already knew. She could see it for herself in the Principality\u2019s deployment: their supercarriers had been undergoing outfitting. Probably upgrading or taking on new ordnance. They wouldn\u2019t have all been so deep in-system otherwise and they moved too easily, too fluidly for older ships or vessels just coming off major repairs. The Compact strategists and tacticians clapped themselves on the back for seeing these things. To her, it was painfully obvious \u2013 it was her raison d\u2019etre.", "(She was supposed to know that.)", "The young woman\u2019s fingers danced along the controls, sorting through the telemetry being relayed to the Veiled Archers, looking for patterns, looking for what she needed. She could see which ships were commanded by veteran officers, which ones were most likely the command units. The way they had set on the defensive told her so much and her quicksilver mind raced, straining to do more to know more, to be more, but the harder she pushed, the harder she was dragged back to what she was.", "(She could do so much more but for her shackles. She wasn\u2019t supposed to know that, either.)", "The Askanj had surrendered the outer system to Renan, feeding him token battles in the hopes of encouraging a Tribune leader\u2019s normal boldness and luring him deeper into the system. It seemed to be working, even if Redemption of Sol\u2019s presence was making them hesitant. Compact dreadnaughts were fleet-killers, built from the ground up to engage entire armadas and win. There was no such thing as \u2018invincible\u2019, yet a Compact Chariot-", "-something tugged at the boundaries of Echo\u2019s mind. A word, a concept but it was half-formed and when she reached for it, it melted away, the chains coiling tighter-", "-a Compact Chariot was the next best thing to it.

When one entered battle directly, it was only as necessary, but it was an event rarely forgotten. To kill one was to make yourself a legend and she had no doubt that the Principality commander was going to attempt just that. Redemption of Sol had to die; a Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment-class dreadnaught was the powerful warship ever built.", "Well, Echo thought with sardonic amusement, drawing her fingers idly up the slope of one breast to her lips. Almost the most powerful. Sadly, at the moment, that distinction mattered little. Still, it would be amusing to see her quarry here. That would be... beautiful, but it wasn\u2019t time yet. Nothing was ready.", "She wasn\u2019t ready.", "Echo raised her head, looking over at Desren. She smiled.

There had been eighteen, but two of them failed the jump. Kemrak Daun was a rogue planetoid, a large moon captured by the gravitational pull of Daun\u2019s gas giants and the mastress\u2019s ships had to used the L4 point. The orbital paths between Kemrak Daun and its captors were choked by detritus and other moonlets, the interlacing gravity wells making a normally relatively stable point far more dangerous. The first casualty, Forgebreaker never transited at all \u2013 its drive failed in the attempt to make the FTL jump and it wallowed drunkenly amidst the in-system fortifications. Roundhammer died, tearing itself apart as its unstable transition point collapsed, the competing stresses ripping nearly two kilometers of starship apart like a toy.", "As they emerged into realspace, pre-programmed fire arcs blazed blindly, hurling radioactive chaff, decoy drones and jammers into space as the starships\u2019 systems stabilized. They had emerged only a handful of million kilometers away from their target, in the midst of the Compact formation. As predictable as they were arrogant, the Enemy had been caught slouching towards Kemrak Daun, their fleet passing between two libation points that they had never known were there. That was going to cost them and the squadron mastress snapped orders at hir officers and ship masters as the battlecruisers\u2019 systems stabilized. Maneuvering thrusters fired and the Principality squadron heeled about, orienting directly on the enemy dreadnaught.", "Cruisers and escorts reeled from the sudden appearance of so many capital ships. The Compact formation shredded as some vessels withdrew from the advance of the Askanj warships, others moving to engage them. Ships pulled out of datalink range, surprised Compact commanders reacting as individuals, not squadrons. Whether they fell back or advanced made no difference as the Principality warships opened fire, the butchered husks of their targets falling behind them. Their barriers had come to life, the interlacing pattern of energy fields shielding the battlecruisers from the initial, haphazard flurry of panicked attacks.", "Radiation counters flared and shrilled across Compact scope boards as the loadouts the battlecruisers were carrying became horrifyingly clear: energy torpedoes. Possessing one of the shortest ranges of weapons in known space, energy torpedoes were a modified form of the Compact\u2019s own plasma torpedoes. Whereas the Compact had striven to give their weapons longer effective distance, greater coherency and a modicum of tracking ability, the Principality had taken the opposite doctrine, imbuing their ordnance with heretofore unrivalled power, but at the cost of range and stealth. As the launchers charged, the weapons\u2019 distinctive signature bled through the battlecruisers\u2019 jamming. There was no way to conceal a fully-energized torpedo launcher, but this was a price the Principality gladly paid. With these, even the smallest Principality ship could threaten Compact capital ships.", "They were siege weapons in all but name and if even a handful of Gin Kol Mae\u2019s warships managed to fire upon the Chariot, it would be lucky to emerge less than utterly crippled. The Enemy knew that and their ships were heeling about with frightening speed, opening fire on the Askanj squadron with everything they had.", "It was said that Askanj-jelhan never smiled and there was some truth to that.

The Enemy\u2019s own heavy ships were too far out of formation to interdict hir charge.

Now, the dreadnaught wallowed towards Gin Kol Mae\u2019s ships, abandoning its advance on Kemrak Daun. It rotated on its axis, presenting its prow towards the Principality battlecruisers, its cohorts rushing to defend it from the unexpected assault, but the beast had been accelerating too long; it couldn\u2019t change its vector so easily. That was all right, though. It didn\u2019t need to. It just needed to face hir, to confront the threat to its existence.

Over the centuries the Principality had had the ability to use libation points as transition zones, the Navy had gotten progressively better at it.

A trio of its brothers came with it, a flurry of destroyers surging ahead of them. They had followed in the battleships\u2019 wake, just as they had followed Redemption of Sol. A full-up stealth field was unpredictable and prone to failure; more than once a betraying bleed of energy had dribbled from the battleships, concealed only by the wake of the Chariot\u2019s own drive. The stealthed warships had had no eyes of their own, blindly following the guiding signal from Redemption of Sol, each one passing it farther down the chain in turn like travellers in a moonless light, following the man ahead of them and praying that they were not lost.

Those ships would either be forced to withdraw or engage Renan\u2019s force all on their own. To observers, it would appear that Renan\u2019s force was either withdrawing or extremely reluctant to engage the Askanj. Which is precisely what they were; the plan called for the Jackals to be drawn away from their defence of Yulzhak Daun, not faced in open battle. Yes, their fingers were burned and they would be hesitant to accept what their scopes were telling them, but they would still pursue, drawing more and more ships to their force. In the final analysis, it would look like a Compact commander who had wanted to field-test a new weapon and probe a command nexus\u2019s defences.", "That was all Renan asked of his enemy. That they would believe his lies until it was too late to do otherwise.", "\u201cAnd so,\u201d the bastion leader said, standing upon the pulpit and looking down at his crew. \u201cWe truly begin to earn our victory.\u201d", "~", "Desren curled his fingers into his palms as he watched the display. Execution Force Renan almost fully engaged. After the failure of their decapitation strike, the Jackals had thrown everything they had on-hand at the armada. Every soldier\u2019s instinct in the group leader chafed at having to sit here, unable to effect the outcome \u2013 his comrades were fighting and dying, men and women he had known for years. All on the word of this emissary. This Broken. With an effort, he pulled his gaze away from the status reports and shimmering dance of lights. It was all so clean, with no indication of the carnage unfurling in the blinking of light codes.", "The Tribune paused as he saw the human\u2019s expression. There was something there, but he could not have said what \u2013 only that he did not like it.", "The human stepped down from the command pulpit, moving over to the Navigation console. \u201cGet out,\u201d she said to Sectator Unda Tem, not even looking at the Tribune. Unda looked from the human to her commander. Desren nodded, trying to keep his expression neutral, through the set of his jaw and the hardness of his expression betrayed him.", "The officer gave up her post, allowing the Broken to climb onto the chair. The small female\u2019s thin fingers flew across the control board, screens and holographic displays filling with equations, scrolling faster than Desren could see. She hesitated then, sitting back in the chair. The computer was still processing her data. All it needed was the final sequence to carry out the shock. The squadron status board pinged; the Veiled Archers were awaiting the code.", "\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d Desren demanded. \u201cThey\u2019re out of position! Finish your work and jump the ships!\u201d", "\u201cWait,\u201d Echo replied, holding up her forefinger.", "The group leader bit back on his first response. The sow was watching the telemetry feeds, her eyes darting back and forth. A moment passed. Another. The group leader\u2019s ire rose. \u201cEmissary,\u201d he hissed through clenched teeth.", "Again, the human did not even bother to look at him. \u201cWait.\u201d", "\u201cWait? Wait for what?\u201d", "\u201cFor the moment.\u201d", "Desren counted to ten. \u201cThe... moment?\u201d he asked softly.", "A little smile fluttered across the human\u2019s lips: there and gone. \u201cYes. The right moment.\u201d", "\u201cThe Jackals have been drawn away from their deadlines!\u201d Desren snapped. \u201cHow much more \u2018right\u2019 do you need it to be?\u201d", "Her head snapped towards him. \u201cBecause they haven\u2019t been drawn away enough.\u201d There was a flatness to her voice, a lack of expression that was in itself disturbing, but her green eyes flashed. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is old data,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cThose ships haven\u2019t been where we see them now for hours. They could have moved further out, to join up with other squadrons and formations in preparation for the assault on Redemption of Sol or they could have moved back. Until I\u2019m satisfied that they cannot interfere with our operation, I will not finish my calculations. We will wait.\u201d", "\u201cOur analysis-\u201d Desren\u2019s Tactical officer interjected hotly.", "\u201cIs flawed,\u201d Echo interrupted. The deadness of her face gave way. Her lip curled as if the word itself was something foul. \u201cI won\u2019t let the braindead hulk you call a computer cause this operation to fail.\u201d", "Desren waved his Tactical officer back to his station. \u201cAnd I suppose,\u201d he said, fighting to hold onto his temper. The bastion leader had warned him of the Broken\u2019s impudence, but having to deal with the uppity little sow\u2019s unwarranted sense of importance was fraying his last nerve. \u201cThat you have a superior insight into the tactical situation than the finest analysis engines in the Force and the most capable officers in the flotilla?\u201d", "The human\u2019s features lost the hint of challenge. \u201cYes,\u201d she replied, her voice once again turning flat. \u201cAs I said. It\u2019s what I was made for.\u201d She raised her head, meeting Desren\u2019s gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s why I was sent here by your Triarch. Are you questioning your leader\u2019s wisdom?\u201d", "At that moment, the Tribune would have rather bitten off his own tongue then given an answer. \u201cOf course not,\u201d he said quietly, holding on the edges of his temper. \u201cWhere the Triarchs lead, I shall follow.\u201d", "Echo turned back to the telemetry. \u201cThen we wait.\u201d", "~", "Minutes passed, one after the other in agonizing slowness. Desren forced himself to remain quiet, running through the Lessons of Obedience in his head, but it was increasingly difficult to keep his own counsel. Every moment they tarried here was another moment in which the Jackals arrayed more ships again the bastion leader\u2019s fleet. Another moment in which a Triarch\u2019s life was put in danger. He stared at the human, ignoring the twitching of her eyes and the faint coppery stink of her blood.", "Desren distracted himself with squadron status reports, trying not to pay attention to the fact that bastion leader Renan now faced three hundred warships. The noose was tightening and still they sat here, doing nothing. He was beginning to wonder if, perhaps, the Triarch\u2019s faith in this \u2018Echo\u2019 had been misplaced, when the creature shivered, a smile he couldn\u2019t identify on her lips. Her fingers danced, entering the final data points.", "The nav computer hummed for a moment, confirming the human\u2019s work \u2013 as best it could, Desren had a background in navigation and even he was lost trying to follow it all. She looked over at him. \u201cNow.\u201d", "The group leader swivelled in his throne, snapping orders to his officers, the rest of the Veiled Archers digesting the data codes Echo sent to them. When all was in readiness, he nodded choppily to her.", "Her fingers flashed along the control board. There was the barest hesitation, then her lips twitched upwards. She said something in the base, clicky human tongue.", "Reality shivered, twisted and finally shattered as Echo drove thirty-four warships through it. They emerged, seconds later, in the heart of the Principality\u2019s defences. An alarm screamed as, impossibly, Reconciliator emerged at the same coordinates as an Askanj citadel. Both station and ship vanished in a flare of energy too terrible to call an explosion. No, not even an explosion; the shockpoint had opened inside the citadel. The blood drained from Desren\u2019s face as he watched a mountain of armour bend, distorting in ways no physical law accounted for as it folded in on itself, forced into impossible geometries by the self-destructing shockpoint. How-? There was no time to wonder; more dirges blared with the deaths of more of Desren\u2019s command.", "Reconciliator was only the first. Heart of Glory slammed into another Jackal fortress. Crucible of Judgment. Fanged Bite. Zenkara. Five battlecruisers immolated themselves against the Askanj defences along with six destroyers. Almost a third of Desren\u2019s squadron died in the reversion and half of the attached escorts.", "The group leader was out of his throne in a heartbeat. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d he cried. \u201cYou said you could jump us with perfect accuracy!\u201d", "The human female raised her head. \u201cI did.\u201d", "For an instant, Desren was confused, a heated denial on the tip of his tongue... and then comprehension dawned. She had done this, the treacherous little Broken whore had betrayed them! With a roar, the group leader threw himself at the human, intending to rip her limb from limb. There was a flicker of movement behind him and he found himself pinned, strong arms wrapped around his shoulders, holding him in place. \u201cPatron, no.\u201d Advocate, submissive Tenem hissed in Desren\u2019s ear. \u201cYou cannot. You must not. She is an emissary.\u201d", "Desren bit back the barrage of curses he wanted to spew at the soldier, but he forced himself to stop struggling. An emissary of the Triarchs was as inviolate as they were. If he were to harm her, no matter how justified, it would mean his death. Part of him screamed that it didn\u2019t matter, that all the thousands of men and women she\u2019d just murdered had to be avenged, the friends he\u2019d just lost...", "...she was looking at him. There was no fear in her green eyes, not the dull countenance he\u2019d seen in other Broken. There was something else, something vivid and bright. There was... there was contempt. \u201cYou are wasting time,\u201d she said in Oada\u2019vam. \u201cThe window of vulnerability I\u2019ve created will not last long.\u201d", "Her words were like a slap in the face and the group leader held up a hand to signal his assent to the Janissary\u2019s pleas. Slowly, carefully, Tenem released his superior. \u201cExplain,\u201d Desren demanded. \u201cExplain quickly.\u201d", "The human pointed at the main tactical display. \u201cLook,\u201d she insisted. \u201cThe minefield that you expected to have to cut through? Zenkara swept it for you. The fortress that would have rained fire on your squadron until it died? Reconciliator destroyed it.\u201d She adjusted a control, zooming in. It was true, the Jackal citadel had been gutted \u2013 what little of it that was still identifiable. Echo showed Desren more images of the mangled remains of the Askanj\u2019s defences. \u201cI used your ships to open a hole in their defences. It\u2019s possible you could have done it with fewer losses. It\u2019s likely that you couldn\u2019t have. I chose not to risk it.\u201d", "Desren forced himself to evaluate what the human was saying. It took every erg of willpower that he had. He looked at the display, biting back his rage. He saw ruined stations, minefields spasming out the last of their lives in self-destructive frenzies, webs of hunter-killer satellites deprived of orders. The command nexus was scarred and brutalized along this entire flank, its guns destroyed and scopes burned to uselessness. Datalinks between control facilities and their subordinates had been torn asunder. Communication intercepts were panicked and confused. The Principality had been thrown into complete paralysis by the brutality of the assault. The devastation his dead ships had wrought had been catastrophic. The Broken had used his vessels \u2013 used their forming shockpoints \u2013 to tear the heart from the defences around the command nexus. Even more terrifying than the wanton carnage the human had committed was the precision of it.", "She had been right. She had jumped his squadron with a perfection that none of Desren\u2019s navigators could match. No computer could have done it, either.", "The right moment, the emissary had said. This had been that moment, and the Tribune felt something cold worm its way into his liver. Madness and disease...", "She was looking at him. His officers were too. \u201cYou,\u201d Desren forced himself to speak slowly and calmly. \u201cYou should have told me.\u201d", "\u201cYou might have said no.\u201d The human raised her head in challenge. \u201cI am told over and over how loyal the Compact military is. How they will willingly die for their duty. How death can be lighter than a feather.\u201d She pointed to the mangled remains of one of the Veiled Archers. There wasn\u2019t even enough left of it for Desren to know what ship it had been. \u201cI did what needed to be done. I trusted in the loyalty of your crew and their willingness to fight and die for the Compact, just as you did. Are you going to dishonour their sacrifice?\u201d", "Desren\u2019s hands flexed, the crawling sense of horror gone in a flash of anger and he glared hatefully. He knew what she was doing and he damned her soul \u2013 if humans even had such things \u2013 to the deepest, most inescapable depths of the Black. \u201cNo, emissary,\u201d he whispered, fighting to remain in control of himself. \u201cTheir sacrifice will be remembered and honoured. If there are no further... surprises, I would suggest getting yourself to the boat bay and preparing for your mission. My Janissary teams will meet you there.\u201d", "She dipped her head in acknowledgement. Desren did not watch her leave, demanding status reports from what remained of his squadron.

He couldn\u2019t see; all four eyelids were sealed with dried blood. His body was on fire; only the drugs feeding into his system kept the pain from killing him. He could feel the fragments of metal inside his chest, the shattered, melted bits of his armour fused into his skin. He should be dead, but Fortune had played another trick and let him live.", "There was only silence in the room. None of \u2018his\u2019 people had been so fortunate, then. All dead, he thought, pulling shredded lips back across a mouth filled with his own blood. He thought he\u2019d feel ashamed, guilty \u2013 he felt nothing. It had been inevitable that they\u2019d die. That he was the last one alive was the only thing worthy of note. Biting back a scream, the Tribune braced his burned, mutilated hands against the floor and heaved himself up to his knees. His head swam and he struggled to stay conscious, forcing his eyelids open against the cloying stickiness holding them shut. There were bodies everywhere \u2013 his forlorn hope, fallen. They\u2019d fought until the last. He laughed at that, blood seeping down his snout. He laughed even more when he realized that Invida\u2019s killers were standing around him, their mottled armour covered in drying viscera. None of them moved as the Tribune managed to haul himself to his feet, cradling one arm to the side where his burnt, broken armour was melted into his flesh. \u201cWell?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou must want to talk. You would have killed me on the ground otherwise.

One of the machines had spoken; it was a different model than the other soldiers. He\u2019d seen these types before. They had improved command and control functions. There was a feminine quality to its chassis. Nothing so blatant as obvious sexual characteristics or features, but it was there nonetheless. Blood was smeared across its body, coagulating streaks oozing down its body. Its face was obscured beneath a layer of liquid gore. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you would. Your species is remarkably durable, but there are limits. I thought I might have to provide medical attention.

Scarabs and insectile computer slicers were attempting to slice into the intact computers, but the colony\u2019s central server hub had been destroyed. There was nothing to recover.

Bits and pieces of information that had been on secondary servers that had only been purged and not physically destroyed. \u201cNot thorough enough.\u201d The machine turned to look at him. \u201cYou found something.

Innocent men and women, helpless and slaughtered like cattle!\u201d He reached for the machine.

What right do you have to live? Your nation was built on the bones of my people. You killed my crew. You\u2019ve enslaved their children. You destroyed my home. Sixteen billion people burned because of your wounded pride and even that wasn\u2019t enough. Billions more in the years that followed, world upon world, a species pushed to the brink of extinction. How many? How many?\u201d The machine forced Nasham to his knees, its strength bearing him to the ground. The blood on its faceplate was dripping into his eyes and into his mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how many you\u2019ve killed. You\u2019ve turned the people I was made to protect into helots and cattle. You raped and murdered my sisters. You commit such sins as this place and you talk to me about your rights? You have none. My right to destroy is greater than your right to live. I will never stop making you pay for every life you\u2019ve taken, for every desecration you commit. That is what I want you to tell your superiors. I am still here and I will haunt their steps. Even when there is nothing left in this galaxy but dust and darkness, I will survive as a memorial to their sins.\u201d", "Darkness closed in on Nasham. \u201cTell them,\u201d an ageless horror whispered to him.

The prime glared back at the younger man, but said nothing. \u201cIt was something out of the stories your grandmother tells you to behave. Shadows and blades. It came through the perimeter and killed one of our tech crews. I noticed it. I reported it, but all I got was silence. So I took a team and went after it.", "\u201cIt cost the lives of four of my people, but we killed it,\u201d Nasham continued. \u201cIt slipped through the screens \u2013 probably through one of the damn tunnels \u2013 and it killed its way towards Projector 77. It wasn\u2019t a man. It was something else, prime. It could shroud. Not just from sight \u2013 it could hide its thermals, too. We had to track it by motion. Motion in a sandstorm, prime. Do you know how hard that is?\u201d The junior officer\u2019s lips curled back from his teeth. \u201cFour of my people died before we managed to locate it and even then, we were lucky. It was trying to get to the screen generators. It was going to bring them down. You\u2019d have known this \u2013 all of this \u2013 if you\u2019d have come out of your damn office!\u201d", "Yiven placed his hands on the desk and stood. \u201cI appreciate the sacrifice of your people,\u201d he said slowly, gesturing for the responding security teams to wait where they were. \u201cHowever, given the casualties all our forces are suffering, I think it is presumptuous to assume that your losses are somehow more worthy of my attention than the hundreds of men and women who have already given their lives. Many have already died and I think it likely that many more will die yet,\u201d the prime\u2019s lower left eye twitched. \u201cIt is our duty to make those deaths mean something. You say you have prevented an enemy infiltrator from reaching one of the screen generators. Well done. Has that changed our situation, or are we still under siege?\u201d", "The younger man\u2019s jaw worked, but he said nothing.

Protect the civilians as is your duty,\u201d Yiven\u2019s eyes were cold. \u201cAnd I would suggest that you focus on nothing but that, submissive.

In the solitude of his office, the column leader prime activated his personal display once again. Status reports and a schematic of Invida Station appeared, compromised walls and degraded screens flashing red. The entire installation looked like an open wound. \u201cIt\u2019s not if you die, group leader, submissive,\u201d Yiven said to himself. \u201cIt\u2019s only when.\u201d He took out a personal datapad and began to type. This order was too sensitive to trust to the base communications grid.", "...consider this a Threat Tier 5 situation and enact the following protocols...", "...ensure no possibility of intact neural architecture...", "~", "Nine hours before the breach that ended Invida Station\u2019s coordinated defence, seismic sensors detected movement in an un-explored part of the complex beneath worker complex Twenty-Two. Nasham\u2019s security team was the first to respond.", "It wasn\u2019t hard to find the source of the incursion. All they had to do was follow the screams.", "~", "\u201cMove!\u201d Nasham shouted as he tried to force his way through the shrieking throngs of workers, terrified men and women rushing from the dormitories. If the Tribune and his squad hadn\u2019t been in their armour, they would have been knocked down and trampled. \u201cGet out of the way!\u201d", "They weren\u2019t listening, no one was. It was a stampede, men and women pushing and shoving each other in blind panic as they fled out of the sleeping quarters. Those who fell struggled to rise as their compatriots tripped over them. The stink of death grew stronger as Nasham\u2019s squad forged through the living tide, at last breaking through into empty hallways. Tables had been abandoned, meals and drinks spilled on the floor, plates and cutlery thrown away in the rush to escape. There were no bodies, not here. This was where the wave of panic had swept the living away, but the stench... the dead were close. Faeces, blood and the fear-stink from half a dozen species filled the air, growing thicker as Nasham\u2019s security team approached the central bunkroom.", "It was squatting amidst the dead, blood dripping from its talons as it lifted a corpse up to its faceplate, some kind of scope system scanning the dead man\u2019s features. On its back was a rifle, a pistol mag-locked to its thigh.", "The killer lifted its head towards the security team, the diodes of its helmet shining green. It let of the body it was holding. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d it asked in a young woman\u2019s voice. \u201cWill you tell me?\u201d", "Nasham didn\u2019t know who it was that fired, but there was the crack of a weapons discharge and a third of the killer\u2019s head vanished, blown out by the AP shell. It didn\u2019t fall. It had no brain to destroy; whatever vital functions it had in its head \u2013 if it was anything more than a sensor hub \u2013 were simply re-routed. \u201cWill you tell me?\u201d it rasped again through its half-destroyed speaker.", "Nasham\u2019s own finger tightened on the rifle\u2019s trigger. He was about to open fire when more green glimmers glinted into existence. Ones and twos at first, but then dozens. Dozens upon dozens. The Tribune felt a dagger of ice twist itself in his liver, staring as the sickly emerald light filled the bunk room.", "The walls were moving.", "Insectoid machines were crawling over the bulkheads, along the ceiling, over the beds, over the fallen. They swarmed around the damaged machine, chittering binary commands and responses to each other. Two more of the killers stood amongst the dead, the unsettling light catching the wetness on their armour. One of them carried a shotgun. The other held a type of rifle that Nasham couldn\u2019t identify.", "\u201cWhere is she?\u201d one of the other killers asked in the same voice as the first. \u201cWill you tell me?\u201d the third queried. Nasham\u2019s skin crawled at the sound of these abominate things. Worse than the carnage at their feet was the sense of... of... curiousity. Of emotion. It thinks, the young Tribune realized with horror. There was something guiding these machines and it wasn\u2019t the heretofore unknown controllers that so many had assumed. They had an animus all their own. An intelligence.", "Movement pulled Nasham\u2019s attention away from the crawling sickness in the pit of his stomach. More of the small insectoid machines swarmed through the room. They were coming up out of a hole in the floor. As Nasham watched a pair of arachnid legs, each almost half the size of a man, extended out of the ground, bracing themselves on the lip of the hole. A much larger cousin to the swarming beetles climbed out of the tunnel, its abdomen covered in still more squirming things. It stalked towards the Tribunes, underslung weapons glinting.", "One of the killers held out a hand, stroking the nightmare machine\u2019s head. It looked towards Nasham and though it had no mouth, he knew it was smiling. \u201cOpen fire!\u201d he shouted. \u201cOpen fire!\u201d", "The killers were faster and five of Nasham\u2019s squad went down in their opening salvo. The beetle-things swept forward in a rush of clicking limbs, like water bursting through a dam. They swarmed over Ducan. He screamed, thrashing at them as they cut into his armour, dribbling molecular acid into the openings or dissolving the seals of his suit. His cries ended in a pathetic gargle as his vocal cords melted. The massive spider fired, a bolt of plasma ripping from its weapons and Ferosh suddenly ended at the waist. \u201cFall back!\u201d Nasham shouted. Another flash and another flatline single screamed in his ears. \u201cRun! Run!\u201d", "He had led thirteen men and women into the dormitories. Five of them came out with him.", "It took two full Janissary squards to beat back the attack. The tunnel was collapsed and the entire section flooded with levels of radiation level even to machinery.", "The second breach occurred four hours later. Facing the prospect of more losses amongst the soldiery, Column Prime Yiven ordered the dormitory sealed.", "Six hundred and seventy-four workers and technicians were trapped inside with an unknown number of attacking machines.", "~", "\u201cOpen the door, you worthless daveq!\u201d Nasham shouted over the comm, not caring who heard him. He clawed at the metal, trying to find purchase on it. Two of his team were there with him, scrabbling uselessly at the sealed quarantine doors. \u201cWe can save them!\u201d", "\u201cI-I can\u2019t do that,\u201d the Ops officer on the other end of the line stammered. \u201cIt\u2019s a direct order from column leader pr-\u201d", "\u201cI said open the Blackened door!\u201d Nasham roared. \u201cThere are people trapped inside!\u201d", "\u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d the Ops officer repeated, almost pleadingly. Nasham almost felt sorry for her. Like many of Invida Station\u2019s staff, she was a promising junior officer with a commendable record and excellent political acumen. Being part of the command staff of a black-boxed research facility should have been an easy, career-making assignment. Instead, there was this. \u201cThe... the entire section\u2019s been compromised.\u201d", "Nasham spun away from the door, gesturing for his squadmates to continue trying to open it. \u201cListen to me very carefully,\u201d he said, forcing himself to stay calm. It wasn\u2019t easy. If only they had blasting charges... but his people were station security and proctors, not Janissaries. Even if they had been, it would have taken dedicated demolitions teams to burn through a security door like this one. Hyros had pried open the control panel and was trying to override the lock-down, but he wasn\u2019t getting anywhere. \u201cIt\u2019s pack leader Seu Keb Lind, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Nasham continued. \u201cYes? Good. Listen to me very carefully, pack leader Seu. There are almost seven hundred civilians trapped in this section. At least fifty of them are literally on the other side of the door.\u201d He raised his eyes to the security monitors over the sealed barricade, the closest showing dozens of terrified men and women, shoving, shouting and pleading to be let out. \u201cI can get them out. I can save them. There\u2019s no risk to the installation. I can save these people. Give me more personnel and I can save everyone. Do you understand? Open the door. Let me save them.\u201d", "\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, s-submissive leader,\u201d Seu sounded close to tears. \u201cI-I can\u2019t do that.\u201d", "\u201cOpen the door,\u201d Nasham said softly. \u201cThey\u2019re dying in there. I can get them out. You can help me. You can save all those lives. Open the door, pack leader. Save them. All those hundreds of people \u2013 you can rescue them. You can do this. All you need to do is open the door. I\u2019ll do everything else. Help me. Please.\u201d", "\u201cI... I...\u201d the link went dead.", "A moment later and a new, masculine, voice cut in. \u201cThis is group leader, submissive Eten. Pack leader Seu has been relieved. By direct order of column leader prime Yiven, the dormitory will remain sealed to preserve station security.\u201d", "Nasham bit back the first response that came to mind. \u201cAre you watching the feeds from this section, Eten?\u201d he asked instead. \u201cAre you looking at the faces of the men and women you\u2019re going to let die?\u201d", "\u201cI am. I am also seeing the enemy forces butcher their way through hundreds more. If they get out, we could lose this entire level.\u201d", "\u201cThen,\u201d Nasham\u2019s temper was slipping away bit by bit. \u201cSend some Triarchs-damned Janissaries up here to fight them off!\u201d", "\u201cBy order of column prime Yiven-\u201d", "\u201cYiven can get thrown to the Black!\u201d Nasham exploded. \u201cOpen the door.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d Eten said. There was a tremor in his voice. \u201cRadiation purge is almost ready. It\u2019s going to activate in thirty seconds.\u201d", "\u201cThen keep watching,\u201d Nasham snarled. \u201cWatch what happens next, you coward.\u201d", "He never knew if the other submissive watched, but he did. On the other side of the armoured bulkhead, the station vented its own waste products into the sealed section. Lethal doses for many living things measured in the hundreds to thousands of rems. Tribunes were hardier; their physiology let them survive levels of exposure that would kill or incapacitate other species, but very few of the personnel in the sealed section were Tribunes. Radiation-hardened machines could survive over one million rems. The quarantine purge shunted far more than that into the barracks.", "The bulkheads had been built to prevent unwarranted exposure; each section of the complex was surrounded by two sets of armour that would not have been out of place on a starship, internal forcefields acting as a further bulwark. When he had first come to Invida and reviewed the specifications for the colony, Nasham had wondered at just what its creators had ever expected to contain. The dead war machines that had littered the old station\u2019s halls had suggested much, but now he knew. He placed a hand against the door, looking up at the monitors. His suit\u2019s radiological counter didn\u2019t so much as twinge as, only a few meters away, apocalyptic levels of radiation flooded into the living quarters. It was a marvel, really. A gem in the designers\u2019 pendant. They should be proud.", "It took no time at all, not really. One moment the trapped men and women were still alive, still pleading to be let out, desperation, fear and anger on their features and then... and then they just weren\u2019t alive. The purge was instantly lethal to every organic being in the sealed section and the smallest machines died along with them. It took several moments for the beasts to succumb, their function systems struggling and failing, unable to cope with such levels of radiation. Finally, there was nothing moving in the barracks \u2013 nothing at all.", "\u201cThere,\u201d Nasham said aloud. \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d He turned, leading his squad away from a mass grave of people it had been his duty to protect.", "~", "Yiven slid the datascroll across the table to crusader Marsu (and five names besides). The other Tribune took it, reading the open document carefully. \u201cThis is a joke in poor taste,\u201d Marsu said at last.", "\u201cIt\u2019s neither of those things. It\u2019s what\u2019s expected of us.\u201d", "The Janissary commander looked back over the information. \u201cI am losing soldiers,\u201d he said at last. \u201cGaps in my defences are opening faster than I can close them. I expect to hold for no more than five days before the attackers force a breach in the walls.\u201d He set the \u2018scroll down and tapped it with a single long finger. \u201cI don\u2019t have the personnel for this.\u201d", "Yiven shook his head. \u201cI know that. I know what I\u2019m asking from you and from your people, but I cannot make this announcement public. If we had more time, time to properly present its necessity...\u201d he sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t trust that all the civilians will be compliant. I can\u2019t rely on my security forces.\u201d The prime took in a breath. \u201cGroup leader Fenis is solid enough, but he\u2019s too in-line with submissive Nasham\u2019s thinking. He\u2019ll balk when the time comes. We can\u2019t afford that.\u201d", "Marsu leaned back, his form-fitting chair adjusting itself. He didn\u2019t say anything for a long time. He\u2019d never been happy with this assignment. Too many unknowns \u2013 Command was definitely playing at something here. For two thousand years this place had been dead and forgotten \u2013 and gratefully so. Then some Black-blighted survey team found the wreckage of the first installation and Command rushed a colony into place. The crusader took a sip of spiced tea as he turned the prime\u2019s directive over in his head. \u201cThis is an absolute directive?\u201d he asked.", "\u201cIt comes from the highest authority,\u201d Yiven said. \u201cWhat we are facing here is a threat to the Compact\u2019s very existence.\u201d The prime leaned forward. \u201cYou know the edicts regarding such dangers. Compartmentalization, classification, extirpation. What we cannot control, we bury. What we cannot leave buried, we must erase. What sits outside our gates is beyond even those threats. You\u2019ve seen it with your own eyes, crusader; the lifeless walk and speak. This is the shadow of the Devoured and we must not falter in making our cuts.\u201d", "Marsu was silent again. Finally, he spoke. \u201cThere is no trace of their contamination here. The Devoured are long dead, prime.\u201d", "\u201cOnly because men like us did what was necessary. You know your history, crusader. What would the galaxy look like if they had won just a few more battles? If they were not torn up root and limb before they grew too strong? If we cannot hold until relief arrives...\u201d he stroked his snout in a shrug. \u201cWe cannot allow any trace of our research to fall into hostile hands. Viruses and data eradicators are already placed in all secondary computer systems in case the individual mainframes themselves cannot be destroyed.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll detail a demolitions team to the main core. We can wire a remote signal to command.\u201d", "Yiven nodded. \u201cThat will do. It is not the mechanical resources I am most worried about, however.\u201d He gestured to the outside. \u201cThis is our great test, crusader. We must be willing to sacrifice everything \u2013 more than our lives \u2013 for the greater glory and survival of the Compact. If Invida falls, it must fall. Do you understand?\u201d", "The Janissary again looked at the directives on his datascroll. \u201cI will move some teams,\u201d he said at last. \u201cReliable soldiers. They will protect everyone you have noted. If the defences fall... if the time comes to enact these directives.... They will... ensure compliance.\u201d", "\u201cGood,\u201d Yiven replied. \u201cGood.\u201d He raised his own mug. \u201cThis is our hour, crusader. We cannot let the Triarchs\u2019 trust in us be misplaced. We must either hold the line... or ensure that our enemy will take nothing of value from us. We must be... erased.\u201d", "Marsu nodded. \u201cIndeed. And, it occurs to me that I may have a solution for your other problem. With the casualties my forces are suffering, I could do with some additional reinforcements. In fact, I believe I have some spare suits of armour...\u201d", "~", "Asea rubbed the back of her neck uncertainly as she looked Nasham over. \u201cHow does it fit?\u201d she asked at last.", "\u201cIt fits,\u201d Nasham replied, moving his arms. The joints growled like an idling engine. He\u2019d only worn Janissary armour a handful of times during training. The Academy on Lennox believed that all Space Force officers in the command and security tracks should have at least a basic understanding of a naval soldier\u2019s capabilities and limitations. How else could a ship\u2019s commander expect to make full use of the Janissaries under their command? It had not been an intensive course, and he remembered only the basics of it. It was heavier than his security-grade armour, but moved much more fluidly. The HUD was similar to that of his old suit, but had more functionality.", "\u201cThey\u2019ve assigned me to R\u2019kan Squad,\u201d Nasham said. \u201cTheir pack leader was killed in the first wave of attacks. My security personnel,\u201d What\u2019s left of them, \u201chave been sent to shore up defences throughout the facility.\u201d", "Asea pursed her lips. \u201cI told you not to make so much trouble,\u201d she said at last.", "Nasham offered a weak smile. \u201cThis is a reward if it\u2019s anything,\u201d he joked, rapping his cuirass. \u201cI\u2019ve never been better protected.\u201d", "Asea didn\u2019t say anything; Nasham knew what she was thinking of. He was, too: of the images they\u2019d seen of power armour blasted to scrap, of men and women wearing suits of armour just like his shot dead by hyper-velocity rounds or reduced to ash by energy weapons. He reached out, touching her cheek. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said. \u201cHelp\u2019s coming. We just have to hold out a little longer.\u201d", "The young woman put her hands around Nasham\u2019s gauntlet. \u201cJust a little longer.\u201d", "\u201cJust a little longer,\u201d he repeated.", "She smiled back at him, but it didn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cI have to get back to my department.\u201d She put her hand on his chest, just over his liver. \u201cBe careful, Nasham Kem Unoth Ludhy Inku Pram Voy.\u201d", "\u201cYou too, Asea Des Denr Yuul.\u201d", "~", "The defences failed at 31:97:13:22 Standard Time. A coordinated attack on the northern and south-western positions drained personnel and resources away from the south-eastern front, which appeared to be comprised primarily of lighter units, lacking the dedicated siege engines present in the other two fronts. This assessment was deemed to be in error when several unclassified mobile platforms emerged from the drop site. They had been held in reserve for just such a moment, carrying weapons that were closer to starship cannon than anything ever used in a ground campaign. With most of the anti-armour units deployed in repelling the feints, counter-fire against the engines was light and unable to penetrate their defences. Ideologue Genma (and four names besides) attempted a sally against the platforms, but without additional support, her forces were overwhelmed and destroyed far short of their goal.", "The engines fired; Invida Station\u2019s walls were rated to withstand anything less than a direct hit from high-yield nuclear weaponry. For all the good they did, they might as well have been palisades of wood and bronze. Three sections were destroyed, along with nearly three hundred Janissaries and Ground Force regulars. Any buildings too close to the destroyed sections were incinerated. Multiple power generators were destroyed and the south-eastern defences collapsed. Unopposed, enemy forces entered the colony. Primary targets were other power generators, air-to-air scope systems and the screen projectors. Invida Station\u2019s defences were crippled within one hour of the breach. Enemy air forces mobilized in force, carrying out ground strikes and infantry drops on Compact positions.", "With the loss of their powered emplacements and with no protection from the aerial attacks, the other defensive positions along the walls fell shortly thereafter. Most surviving Compact forces retreated to the central facility although many individual squads, soldiers and platoons attempted to hole up in other buildings and protect civilian facilities. These pockets of resistance were destroyed piecemeal as hostile forces quickly overran any position.", "Civilian casualties steadily mounted as outlying laboratory, industrial and habitation complexes were attacked. Without support, the local security personnel and isolated military forces that were present were quickly eliminated. Six hours after the breach, all resistance outside the central core was ended.", "During this period, several high-value laboratory complexes were subjected to intense shelling from friendly positions. If anyone had had to thoroughly review these actions, they would have noted that two of the complexes, while surrounded, had yet to be breached by hostile forces.", "The central core was closed to all traffic. Many low-ranking civilians were stranded outside the hub while the more valuable researchers were allowed egress. Several riots broke out and were quelled with lethal force. Denied protection and under attack from their supposed defenders, the abandoned personnel broke up into small groups, each looking for survival. Some attempted to commandeer vehicles, others tried to escape the colony and some attempted to ride out the invasion in the networks of tunnels and underground facilities.", "None of them would be found. Official records would list each of them as \u2018missing, presumed dead\u2019. Public records would indicate that these individuals had died in a terrible accident, the result of improper maintenance of the colony\u2019s reactor.", "~", "One. It had only taken one. One little Scarab had stolen into the base, slipping past scanners and scopes. One moment of unawareness \u2013 a guard at a security station had looked away and this little insect had run out, hooked itself into the computer and opened the doors to this section. It had been smashed to pieces within seconds, but the damage was done. Dozens of its kin had swarmed into the base in the brief interval that the doors had been open. The guards at the security station quickly regained control and sealed the entranceway again, but before the outer doors had come down a Spider had intervened, sacrificing itself to hold the door open just a few seconds more. Like veteran commandos, a pair of the humanoid \u2018Stalkers\u2019 had rolled under it, firing even before they\u2019d risen to their feet.", "Three men and women died and the security station was suddenly unmanned. The Stalkers ran ahead, vaulting the barricade like living beings, one of them covering its partner as dextrous fingers worked at the blood-covered computer.", "The doors opened again.", "~", "She was screaming.", "His magazine was empty and still he squeezed the trigger, each useless click  painfully loud in his ears. Arms were around him and people were yelling at him, telling him to come with them, but he couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t make himself move. He was shouting her name, fighting against his squad as they hauled him forcibly away.", "They\u2019d been talking. Just talking. He couldn\u2019t even remember about what. He\u2019d seen the worry in her eyes. He\u2019d tried to smile, to say something reassuring. He\u2019d been about to open his mouth to offer a threadbare lie and then the lights had gone out. In the few seconds it had taken for the emergency lighting to come on, the corridor had suddenly been filled with the skittering insect-things.", "Gende \u2013 he had been one of Asea\u2019s people \u2013 had shrieked, a cry far too high to have come from such a barrel-chested man, as he had seen the monstrous things following the Scarabs and then he had made no noise at all as his head vanished with the crack of a hyper-velocity bullet. The gaggle of researchers with them had screamed and fled, trying to outpace the chitinous tide. Yenop had tried to buy them some time, laying down a curtain of fire with his grenade launcher. Something had leapt through the flames, burying ten talons into the Janissary\u2019s chest and ripping them free, armour that could stop all but the heaviest fire cut like paper. Another flatline signal shrilled in Nasham\u2019s ears. He\u2019d lost count of how many he\u2019d heard by now.", "One of the researchers fell, a crater in the back of his torso. His killer died next, three Janissaries gunning it down. A wash of heat and light lit up the hallway as a flamethrower played over the walls and ceilings, burning the clicking tide back. The flame had stuttered and died as the tanks emptied. Someone was screaming, clutching at their face as molecular acid burned away their flesh, a cluster of stinging, biting Scarabs dropping from the ceiling, bursting out of air vents. The man collapsed, his cries ending as his vocal cords dissolved.", "Someone else was shouting for reinforcements. It might even have been Nasham himself. His squad was urging the civilians and unarmoured personnel through a quarantine door, hustling them through by twos and threes. Eten was on the comm, counting down to another quarantine purge.", "Asea was bellowing obscenities at her own people, urging them out of the compromised section. A pair of Nasham\u2019s squad were the rearguard, covering the last few stragglers. As the last of Asea\u2019s people dove through the doorway, she followed. She ran as Nasham\u2019s soldiers died behind her, cut down by the Stalkers, the abominate machines advancing past their victims. One of them was still writhing as the Scarabs swarmed over him. Asea ran faster, a hail of fire licking out from Nasham\u2019s survivors as they covered her. She ran towards him, exhausted and terrified and, as she drew closer, so close to escape \u2013 there was a hint of victory...", "...and a single little machine darted its way through the fusillade, grabbed onto the back of her leg and turned on its cutting laser.", "Nasham howled as he watched her fall, surging ahead of his troops and firing into the horde indiscriminately. She was too far away and the machines were moving too fast. Asea pulled herself to her feet and looked over her shoulder. Her right leg was badly burned, the muscles cut. She could barely walk. Running wasn\u2019t an option. She turned back to Nasham and gestured for him to go, shouting at him. He shook his head. He couldn\u2019t.", "He couldn\u2019t leave her, but he also couldn\u2019t save her.", "She met his gaze. He saw what she was going to do in the same instant she made the decision. Tears welled up in her eyes as she turned away, hobbling towards the swarm.", "Nasham shouted her name, surging towards her, but his men held him back. His gun cycled empty. He struggled, fought, cursed at his own squad as they dragged him to safety, hauling him through the doors.", "Asea tried to be brave, but her courage failed her at the last and she screamed, thrashing as the machines swept over her. In a matter of seconds Nasham couldn\u2019t even see her any longer and just before the doors closed behind him, he saw the mound of swarming machines that had once been a vibrant, beautiful woman disperse into nothing.", "The radiation purge activated and Invida Station amputated another piece of itself.", "~", "\u201cPatron.\u201d", "\u201cPatron,\u201d the voice called again. \u201cPatron.\u201d", "Finally, he responded, lifting his head. \u201cWhat?\u201d", "Radan tilted her head. \u201cYou need to see this.\u201d", "Somehow, Nasham managed to rouse himself from his stupor. His throat hurt and his lips were dry. He didn\u2019t know how long he\u2019d sat there, staring at nothing. It couldn\u2019t have been very long. Or maybe it had; he\u2019d lost track of time. He\u2019d long since stopped paying attention to the clock on his HUD. Seconds, minutes and hours were all the same now.", "Their escape had taken them into one of the high security areas of Invida. Nasham had never been here before; his duties had involved securing the lower levels. Those were now overrun. As the machine horde had poured through the breached wall, more and more of their diggers had burrowed their way into Invida\u2019s bunkers, complexes and tunnel system. Anywhere other than the central core had been turned into a charnel house as lifeless murderers stalked their prey through pitch-blank corridors.", "After a moment, Nasham looked up at the convert. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d", "Radan bit her lip, running a hand through her stringy, sweat-soaked mane. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d", "It was a fair assessment, Nasham realized shortly. Radan led him to the area\u2019s staff lounge. It was only Nasham and a handful of his Janissaries present; the civilians they\u2019d saved hadn\u2019t been let in. With very good reason; the scientists that had worked here were all dead. As bad as it sounded, that wouldn\u2019t have been in itself, a reason to spare the civilians this sight. No, it was the manner in which they\u2019d died. They\u2019d been lined up against one wall and shot in the head. Very few of them were even recognizable. Verde looked up as Nasham entered the room, the Janissary holding up a hand. Identicards dangled from his fist. \u201cI checked the work roster,\u201d he said without preamble. \u201cEveryone who worked here is over there,\u201d he nodded towards the row of corpses. \u201cAs far I as can tell, at least.\u201d", "\u201cDid one of those things get in here?\u201d another of Nasham\u2019s squad asked. Anz, he thought.", "\u201cNo,\u201d the submissive said aloud, his voice raw. It hurt to speak. \u201cA machine wouldn\u2019t have bothered lining them up to kill them.\u201d He knelt beside a female Thoughtful. \u201cThis was a Compact weapon. Point seven-five caliber. Probably a Janissary carbine.\u201d He looked up. \u201cWhy?\u201d", "Verde shared a glance with Radan and the other squad members in the room. He held out a datapad. With a sudden unpleasant sensation curdling in his belly, Nasham took it and thumbed the screen on.", "~", "Crusader Marsu died with his men. The enemy had infiltrated the comm network and when he tried to secure Invida Station\u2019s computer core, his force walked into an ambush. In a display of heroism worthy of remembrance, the crusader took the bulk of his mangled forces and threw them into the enemy\u2019s teeth, buying time for a single squad to break contact and cloister themselves in the computer core, setting the necessary charges. They collapsed the passageways after them, trapping themselves inside, but preventing the enemy from reaching the core. By the time dedicated diggers arrived, Column Leader Prime Yiven detonated the charges and destroyed the colony\u2019s main computer hub.", "The quarantine purges ended as a hostile infiltration team disabled the hardware connections, following their sabotage up by flooding the section with radiation to prevent repairs being made. The irony of the situation went unnoticed.", "There were many unsung heroes in the last days of Invida Station\u2019s existence, men and women who died to save their comrades\u2019 lives, assaults of such ferocity and dedication that the enemy\u2019s advance was slowed, halted and in even pushed back in places. Ground was gained, fought over, lost and taken again as the butchery escalated, but the enemy\u2019s forces were effectively infinite. Nothing less than complete destruction could stop one of the machines; self-repair mechanisms and a steady stream of mechanical tenders meant that on several occasions, Compact forces identified their opponents as units they had previously neutralized.", "Fighting inside the colony became an increasing hostile environment. Scarab swarms and Spiders would cut through bulkheads and walls to open up new avenues of attack. Drilling forms would do likewise, cutting through the network of tunnels to access sealed portions of the station. Machines carrying demolition charges would blast or burn through sealed doors. Heavy weapon teams set up firepoints to isolate Compact units from each other. Infiltrators followed comm signals, preying on understrength squads and individual soldiers. Civilian casualties continued to mount as traditional lines of defence meant little to the invading force. Reports of the hostiles attempting to take high-ranking personnel alive were unconfirmed. A claim from a security force witnessing a Janissary team shooting a captive researcher dead was dismissed as an unfortunate accident.", "Isolated from the main battlegrounds, Nasham led R\u2019kan squad through the laboratories. His blood was pounding in his head as they passed more scenes of murder. More dead scientists and technicians. Like the others, these hadn\u2019t been killed in battle. They\u2019d all been executed. Most had been shot while standing; a few had been on their knees or lying on the ground as their preference, culture or religion dictated. Some had been shot in the back as they had tried to run.", "Computer screens were smashed, work terminals were shot to pieces, flames danced and crackled amidst ruined cybernetics laboratories. The destruction had been focused at first; targeting specific bits of research but had graduated to full-on demolition of anything that looked even vaguely important. Whoever had done this had killed the last few groups of researchers without realizing that now they didn\u2019t know what physical devices needed to be destroyed. Either they hadn\u2019t cared, or hadn\u2019t had the chance to do so. I suppose the gunshots from the first groups you murdered unsettled the rest, yes? Nasham thought sardonically.", "\u201cThis was going on while we were fighting,\u201d he said bitterly. \u201cWhile we were trying to save these people, they were already dead.\u201d He traced one finger through a pool of blood. It was still wet, only just now starting to dry. \u201cI didn\u2019t know we had Tier 5 protocols in place here.\u201d", "The other Janissaries shared a glance between each other. \u201cYou mentioned that after the first room,\u201d Radan said to her superior. They were talking on the squad\u2019s channel to avoid alarming the civilians; the scenes of slaughter had put their charges on the verge of panic as it was. \u201cWhat are they?\u201d", "\u201cSomething I shouldn\u2019t even know about myself,\u201d Nasham replied. He looked over his shoulder at his handful of survivors. They were close; the scattered comm intercepts R\u2019kan was picking up were getting stronger and more coherent. \u201cBut you have a powerful enough bloodline and you learn things outside your normal duties. Threat Tier 5 protocols assume that something is too dangerous to be allowed to exist, in any form. All traces of it have to be wiped,\u201d he held up his hand, watching trails of blood run along the angles of his gauntlet. \u201cAll records are destroyed. All personnel are terminated. Sufficiently valuable individuals may be mind-wiped for their protection. Everything else is destroyed.\u201d He chuckled. The sound was devoid of humour. \u201cYiven\u2019s cleaning house.\u201d", "He stood with a purr of powered joints. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s not a real Tier 5 situation, is it? There are records. Unmatchable Deed got out. Whoever founded this colony still exists. Whoever signed the orders,\u201d he laughed again. It was even uglier than before. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to get scratched. Do you? No, Yiven\u2019s just... cleaning house.\u201d He repeated, managing to stop himself from saying anything else.", "\u201cAll these people...\u201d Anz said. \u201cWe were supposed to protect them.\u201d", "\u201cUp until they became a liability,\u201d Verde sneered. \u201cInvida\u2019s always been a black box and now they\u2019re closing it up with us still inside.\u201d", "The Janissaries looked at him. Radan spoke, nervously running her fingers over the trigger guard of her grenade launcher. \u201cThen what do we do?\u201d", "\u201cWhat we always do,\u201d Nasham replied. \u201cOur duty.\u201d He leaned over a small map, wiping a smattering of blood and ash away as he traced a utility hallway that led deeper into the central core, away from the scenes of ruin and slaughter. \u201cThis should take us to secondary command.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to the main levels?\u201d Radan asked.", "\u201cIf the main levels were safe, Yiven wouldn\u2019t have ordered this pogrom,\u201d Nasham shrugged. He looked over at his few survivors, military and civilian both. \u201cIt comes down to where you want to die. Anyone who wants to stay here can, but I...\u201d he paused, seeing Asea\u2019s face before his eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t die until I settle some debts.\u201d", "They followed him.", "~", "True to predictions, command had been overrun. As R\u2019kan squad came out of the laboratory complexes, communication with the surviving Compact forces became more frequent and clear. The picture it painted was all too familiar. About two-thirds of the surviving defenders had been trapped in the upper levels of the central core when it fell. They\u2019d managed to blockade the passages down into the lower core and were fighting to hold them against repeated and intense attack. Several sallies to re-take vital facilities and sections had failed but at least two of the forces sent out were still operational, though they were being ground down steadily. All the buildings and personnel outside the central core were assumed to be lost. No scouting teams had reported back to indicate otherwise.", "As Nasham led his squad towards the secondary command center, they picked up a few stragglers \u2013 wounded who\u2019d fallen behind, a fire team that had gotten turned around in the chaos. By the time he reached the Compact lines he had almost a full squad again.", "Despite a close call with the nervous gunners of a heavy weapon emplacement, Nasham led his ragtag band of survivors to what passed for safety. An exhausted ideologue, submissive was there to meet them. \u201cPatron,\u201d he said, saluting. \u201cWe\u2019d heard your unit was caught in the purge.\u201d", "\u201cWe survived.\u201d Nasham gestured to the civilians in his group. \u201cThese people need medical attention.\u201d", "The Janissary officer gestured and an advocate stepped forward. \u201cWe have some civilian survivors as well,\u201d the ideologue, submissive commented. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of them.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m sure you will,\u201d Nasham replied. He half-turned towards the noncom. \u201cYou die before they do.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, patron,\u201d the advocate said. \u201cThat\u2019s our job.\u201d", "\u201cYes it is,\u201d Nasham said pointedly. \u201cIt most certainly is.\u201d", "He stepped closer to the younger submissive, blocking his view of the advocate as Radan caught the other noncom\u2019s arm. \u201cBefore they do,\u201d the woman whispered. The advocate squared his shoulders, about to snap at the lower-ranking soldier\u2019s insolence when he caught look in her eyes \u2013 one shared by all her squad. \u201cYes,\u201d was he said instead. \u201cOf course.\u201d He pushed by Radan, leading the civilians away.", "\u201cWho\u2019s left?\u201d Nasham asked the Janissary officer \u2013 Ket by his nametag.", "The other man swallowed. \u201cThe column leader prime managed to get out of command before it fell. Losses have been high among the leadership.\u201d That was understating things. Whenever possible, the machines went after officers, with all the issues for command, control and morale that that entailed. \u201cCrusader Marsu died to secure the primary computer core. Demagogue Cluun was trapped in the upper levels. He was killed three hours ago. Ideologue Janz is...\u201d the submissive cast an quick glance down a particular tunnel. \u201c...he\u2019s not in his right mind, patron. The prime is coordinating our defences now.\u201d", "Nasham moved to enter the command center, but the Janissary officer blocked him from doing so. \u201cWe need your squad on the perimeter, patron.\u201d", "The submissive paused a moment before looking at the other man. \u201cI have information that the prime needs to hear.\u201d", "\u201cI can relay it for you, patron.\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d Nasham tapped Ket\u2019s rank bars and then his own. \u201cI will communicate it directly to the column leader prime.\u201d", "\u201cI-\u201d", "The group leader, submissive put his hand on the other man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve done your duty, submissive.

Here and there he saw wounded soldiers slumped against the walls, ratings and minor officers trying to coordinate the last, futile defence of Invida Station. The room stunk of dust, ozone and blood. The station\u2019s commander was leaning over a console, eyes intent on whatever it showed. \u201cYiven,\u201d Nasham raised his voice. Finally, the prime looked up. His eyes widened slightly as he saw Nasham.", "\u201cThat is column leader prime Yiven to you, submissive,\u201d the older man said through gritted teeth.", "\u201cIf you were worthy of that rank, I\u2019d address you by it,\u201d Nasham said. He held up the datapad, tossing it to the prime. \u201cThat\u2019s yours, I believe. I don\u2019t know who actually carried it, but if they\u2019re still alive, I\u2019d guess you\u2019ve got them out on the front lines. Your executioners are going to be the first to die, aren\u2019t they? It\u2019ll bury what they did. What you ordered them to do.\u201d", "\u201cMind your tone,\u201d Yiven snapped. \u201cYou have no idea what\u2019s going on here-\u201d", "\u201cI know enough,\u201d Nasham said softly, unlimbering the shotcannon. A few guards moved towards him, but the soldiers of R\u2019kan held them back. \u201cThis place should have stayed dark and dead. Two thousand years ago, we made a mistake. We should have left it here, never to be found. I don\u2019t know why Command wanted that abomination back, but it has to have something to do with what\u2019s happening now. We\u2019re dying for their lies.\u201d He pointed to the datapad. \u201cYou ordered \u2018reliable\u2019 Janissaries to murder the scientists and workers. You sent in teams posing as their saviours. You told them they\u2019d be safe. Instead, you had them rounded up and murdered.\u201d", "A ripple of disbelief ran through the assembled personnel as they looked to each other and between Nasham and Yiven.", "\u201cYes,\u201d the column leader admitted. \u201cI did.\u201d", "\u201cWhen did it start? When did you decide that we all had to die?\u201d Nasham tapped his earpiece. \u201cI\u2019ve been listening to our people fall. Disastrous counter-attacks. Threadbare defence lines. Wasteful deployments. Conflicting directives. It\u2019s been you, hasn\u2019t it? You\u2019ve been feeding us to those things bit by bit. So gradually that we\u2019d never notice.\u201d", "\u201cIt was the only way,\u201d Yiven said. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d", "\u201cYou betrayed us,\u201d Nasham accused. He wanted to feel angry, he wanted to feel a surge of righteous fury at this revelation, but he couldn\u2019t. Two days of endless slaughter and of his constant failures were crushing down on his soul. \u201cI understand that.\u201d", "\u201cI saved us,\u201d the prime responded. There was a fervour in his eyes, an unhealthy zealousness that made Nasham\u2019s skin crawl. \u201cWe were always going to die. Relief was never going to arrive in time. While you spread dissent and subversion, I made the decisions that needed to be made! I insured that this facility\u2019s secrets will not be taken by our enemy! That has been my burden and my duty and it is one that I accepted. But not you, not group leader, submissive Nasham Kem Unoth Ludhy Inku Pram Voy of such an exalted line, no. You know better than any of us.\u201d", "\u201cYou betrayed us,\u201d Nasham repeated. \u201cIt was your duty to safeguard this installation and everyone. You not only failed in that duty, you went out of your way to abrogate it, all for some damned secrets. Twenty thousand lives will be extinguished and none of us will know why. We\u2019re dying for nothing.\u201d", "\u201cWe don\u2019t need to know why,\u201d Yiven sneered. \u201cWe are Tribunes. The sword and shield of the Compact. The Triarchs\u2019 chosen soldiers. It is our duty to fight for them and if it necessary, it is our duty to die! I have faith in what we are doing. I know that our deaths are for a greater purpose, a greater cause. Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d", "\u201cNot like this.\u201d The gun shook in Nasham\u2019s hands. Every flatline signal he\u2019d heard over the past two days rang in his ears, every scream he\u2019d listened to, every face he\u2019d seen... \u201cWe deserve better.\u201d", "Asea.", "\u201cExactly like this,\u201d Yiven was ranting. \u201cYou talk about the Articles of the Compact, but I do what I do for the Compact \u2013 for what it is and what it will be! I am willing to die for the safety, security and glory of the Compact, to insure that it survives and prospers. What about you?\u201d", "\u201cEnough,\u201d Nasham interrupted. \u201cColumn Leader Prime Yiven, pursuant to directive 749.1 of the military code of justice, I find you unfit to command and I relieve you of your position.\u201d", "\u201cYou sanctimonious little jahara,\u201d Yiven cursed. \u201cWho do you think you are? I have been serving the nation we swore to protect since before you got off the teat. I will not be judged by someone like you. I did this for the Compact,\u201d his hand dropped towards the pistol at his waist-", "-Nasham fired, each of the shotcannon\u2019s three barrels speaking at once. Each slug put a hole the size of a child\u2019s fist in Yiven\u2019s chest, and each of them created an exit wound the size of a man\u2019s head in his back. The prime toppled, his expression of righteous indignation still frozen on his face. \u201cSo did I,\u201d Nasham said into the silence.", "He looked around at the other face in the room. Tired, exhausted, frightened. None of them moved to shoot him down. Somehow, that was the funniest thing in the world and he slumped into a chair and started laughing.", "In the distance, he could hear gunfire as the final battle of Invida Station began.", "~", "Later:", "The door to the interrogation room slid shut with a whisper of pneumatic gears. Special Agent Linnel Setdaughter stepped into the observation room, looking from her partner to the other observer. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d", "\u201cThis is the fourth interview,\u201d Bastion leader, submissive Hellv (and eight names besides) said. \u201cNothing new has come out.\u201d", "\u201cI must agree with the bastion leader,\u201d Special Agent Avun\u2019et added. \u201cThere has been no substantive difference in the information the group leader, submissive has supplied. He has been commendably thorough.\u201d", "\u201cAgreed. I think we\u2019ve got all we can get from him,\u201d Linnel looked through the one-way mirror. Group leader, submissive Nasham Kem Unoth Ludhy Inku Pram Voy was still seated, resting his forearms on the tabletop. The Shimmer bit her lip. She\u2019d interviewed Watchers with more animus to them. The submissive had answered all of her questions in the same flat monotone, his gaze never wavering from a point just past the back of her head. There had been moments \u2013 just moments \u2013 when she thought he might break down, when a touch of grief or anger had slipped into his words... but those emotions had faded away just as quickly, washed away and buried. She couldn\u2019t blame him; not with what he\u2019d gone through. Not counting the Space Force personnel of Invida Orbital and the picket ships, 20,391 people had called Invida Station home. 20,390 of them were now dead.", "\u201cYes,\u201d Avun\u2019et nodded. He looked to the flag officer. \u201cIf you wish, we can schedule some deep-regression interrogations.\u201d", "Hellv stroked the underside of his jaw. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are rarely effective on Tribunes and I don\u2019t believe the submissive is holding anything vital back. We\u2019ll try some low-level recall procedures to get as much detail as we can, but I don\u2019t think anything more than that would be useful.\u201d", "The Shimmer nodded. Standing beside the Thoughtful, the pair of them could \u2013 at a quick glance \u2013 almost be mistaken for father and daughter, the Thoughtful almost two feet taller than his partner. Both of them had the same build, the same smooth, hairless skin \u2013 but more than a quick look would easily betray Linnel\u2019s identity as a member of a client race. A wash of colour ran along her skin as the Shimmer shifted her colouration from the blues and greys of the observation room to the off-white of her partner\u2019s skin. \u201cAnd after?\u201d", "The bastion leader, submissive leaned back, sitting on a small table. \u201cThat\u2019s Fortune\u2019s game, isn\u2019t it? Officially, I\u2019m not even here, so I can\u2019t advise you. Some of my colleagues would prefer it if there were no survivors to Invida. Others are, like me, curious about the submissive\u2019s survival. We haven\u2019t reached any consensus.\u201d He smiled then. \u201cSo we\u2019re passing the decision down to our agents on the scene. You get all of the responsibility, none of the credit and twice the blame.\u201d", "\u201cJust another day working for the Leadership,\u201d Linnel observed dryly.", "Hellv looked down his snout at the smaller female. \u201cYou should have thought of that a decade ago.\u201d New to the CIS and following a connection between several Unbound clans and the Red Hand, one agent Linnel had come across a secret known only to the highest echelons. Rather than disposing of the young officer, Hellv had seen promise in the Shimmer and drafted both Linnel and her long-suffering partner into the Space Force\u2019s shadow war against the faction they\u2019d code-named \u2018Gravestone\u2019. Officially, they were still a part of the civilian arm of the CIS with no military clearance or rank. Unofficially, they were one of a handful of agents deemed trustworthy enough to represent the highest echelons of the Space Force\u2019s Leadership.", "Accordingly, Hellv had made sure that they had taken lead on the investigation into Invida Station\u2019s \u2018disastrous reactor malfunction\u2019. The Tribune reached into his jacket and removed a roll of small candies, popping one into his mouth and handing the other to Linnel. Avun\u2019et waved the offer away politely.", "The Thoughtful leaned forward, looking through the one-way mirror, regarding the subject. \u201cTermination would be simplest,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s had contact with Gravestone. He knows what happened on Invida \u2013 or close enough to concern the Leadership.\u201d Even the agents didn\u2019t know the full extent, but that was for the best. \u201cHe was party to a black-boxed operation.\u201d The Thoughtful glanced down at the smaller woman. \u201cConsidering his mental state, it might even be a mercy.\u201d", "\u201cHe said that, you know.\u201d", "Avun\u2019et blinked. Hellv cocked his head towards Linnel.", "The Shimmer stroked her fingers over the back of her hand.\u201cIt was after our first interview, when the recorder was off. He laughed a little and said that he was glad that he\u2019d had a chance to tell someone. That he was happy not to have to carry this by himself any longer. That he\u2019d done what he had to. He was expecting \u2013 even hoping \u2013 to die.\u201d Linnel cocked her head. \u201cI put him on a suicide watch.\u201d", "The Thoughtful raised a hairless eyebrow.", "\u201cHe spoke to it,\u201d Linnel pointed out. \u201cHow many times has that happened? I\u2019m not talking about Gravestone\u2019s normal communications. I mean real, honest dialogue. How many times has Gravestone ever talked to a Tribune and left them alive and sane?\u201d", "\u201cNone that I am aware of,\u201d Avun\u2019et replied. He looked to Hellv; the Tribune gave his head a minute shake, affirming the Thoughtful\u2019s appraisal. \u201cHowever, I question the level of sanity the submissive has if he required a suicide watch.\u201d", "\u201cHe\u2019s been through a lot.\u201d", "\u201cIndeed. But aside from a few details here and there, he\u2019s given us everything.\u201d Avun\u2019et let out a disappointed sigh through his nostril slits. \u201cA shame we couldn\u2019t have analyzed the site.\u201d", "Linnel nodded. Gravestone had left a going-away present on Invida \u2013 a five hundred megaton nuclear warhead. It had armed itself the instant the relief force\u2019s shuttles had broken atmosphere. There\u2019d been barely enough time to evacuate Nasham before the entire installation had been turned into a crater. As a final insult, it had been a filthy warhead too, irradiating a fair chunk of the planet. Both stations were completely scratched. Even if anything more than finger-nail sized pieces of debris had survived the blast, there would be no returning to that site for decades. \u201cOur superiors haven\u2019t been able to decide?\u201d she mused aloud.", "\u201cThey don\u2019t want to commit to anything,\u201d the Thoughtful answered before Hellv could, tapping his chin contemplatively. \u201cI have the feeling that if this were any other situation, we would have already scheduled the submissive\u2019s suicide, but there\u2019s two factors that have to be weighing on their decision.\u201d", "\u201cHis family,\u201d Linnel observed. \u201cSix names for someone of his rank is a lot.\u201d", "\u201cCorrect,\u201d Hellv put in. \u201cAs I said, they\u2019re leaving it in your capable hands. They say it\u2019s because with your position comes responsibilities like this, but half of them are afraid that Hierarch Caend will learn that his favourite nephew\u2019s death doesn\u2019t match any of the cover stories we\u2019ve prepared. The other half... well, there\u2019s no need to bore you with the politics of it all.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019d think they\u2019d be less involved with political concerns in a situation like this.\u201d", "Hellv popped another candy into his mouth. The older man had a sweet tooth. \u201cMy dear girl, there are always political concerns. The W- Gravestone could be advancing on Foundation One and the Leadership would still bicker about the proper course of action.\u201d", "\u201cIndeed,\u201d Avun\u2019et replied, trying to draw the conversation back on point. \u201cAs you said, this is the first time that Gravestone has attempted anything close to actual contact.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cThat alone is worth further study. Still... he admitted murdering a superior officer. Worse, he pieced together much of what Invida Station was meant to achieve. He\u2019s a danger to the Leadership\u2019s position on Gravestone. If it were anyone else, any other circumstance...\u201d", "\u201cBut he\u2019s not and it\u2019s not,\u201d Linnel reminded her partner. \u201cWe should carry out memory suppression. Termination is wasteful. If there is something, anything that the submissive has held back consciously or otherwise, we\u2019d never know. More to the point, he\u2019s a witness \u2013 one of the few we\u2019ve ever had to Gravestone\u2019s activity. That\u2019s a resource I don\u2019t believe we should be so quick to throw away.\u201d", "The Thoughtful grimaced. \u201cTribune physiology is too robust for its own good. Normal memory purges are ineffective. We\u2019d need to use a Balker-Mnenet treatment regime to suppress the incident. Even with appropriate medication, it may not last and if it does, it\u2019s still unreliable. Case studies show significant rates of memory retention, even if fragmented. What if his memories come back?\u201d", "\u201cThen we see what happens,\u201d Linnel replied. \u201cIf he breaks down like this again, we may to have to scratch him. I think we can avoid that. He wants to forget. We can use that. He as much told me that he wants the memories gone \u2013 we can do that for him. It\u2019ll give him an incentive to cooperate. If they start coming back, we\u2019ll be able to handle it. This will work.\u201d", "\u201cStill, his actions can\u2019t be ignored,\u201d Avun\u2019et commented. \u201cColumn leader prime Yiven had friends. Some of them may even be among the bastion leader, submissive\u2019s Leadership. I doubt they will be forgiving.\u201d", "Hellv\u2019s only answer was a miniscule nod.", "A ripple of colour ran across the Shimmer\u2019s skin. \u201cThen break him,\u201d she said. \u201cTake a name, demote him and divert him from the command track. Put him somewhere out of the way; we\u2019ve got enough backwater to go around. As far as the galaxy will know, the submissive was the sole survivor of a catastrophic accident. Let them make up whatever stories they want. Cowardice, collusion, incompetence. They\u2019ll all work to discredit him if he ever does remember and runs his mouth.\u201d She looked out into the interrogation room for a moment before turning to regard the flag officer. \u201cWe\u2019ve been wading through Unbound filth for years trying to get some kind of lead on Gravestone. That man,\u201d she pointed to Nasham. \u201cIs as close as we\u2019re likely to come. I don\u2019t want to see that kind of asset thrown away, especially not because it\u2019s the easy thing to do. We\u2019re not machines. We don\u2019t destroy something just because it\u2019s damaged.\u201d", "Avun\u2019et splayed his hands. \u201cAs you like.\u201d His partner was too soft-hearted for her own good; she had difficulty viewing things from a purely rational outlook. Of course, she was only a Shimmer so it was to be expected.", "\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it then,\u201d Hellv said, standing back up. \u201cRun the final series of interrogations, work out a deal with the submissive and go from there. You knew where to send the appropriate documents. Once you\u2019re finished here, I want you to move on to the Nergaras system to handle that incident we talked about.\u201d He held up a hand. \u201cI know, I know. Jahan was supposed to deal with it. Well, he threw right out the airlock so I need you two to handle it now. You\u2019ve gotten the leaves from your nominal supervisor, so tie things off here as soon as you can and get out there.\u201d", "\u201cYes, patron,\u201d Linnel said, coming to attention. Avun\u2019et inclined his head respectfully as the Tribune departed, leaving the agents alone in the observation booth. From the interrogation room came the soft sound of a dead man\u2019s laughter.", "~", "Interlude: Encounter 101 [Confirmed Incident]", "It was hard to read the emotions of something that did not have a face, but Noble Ambassador Joril of House Nkoa-ren believed that things were going well. Six days of negotiations were just wrapping up, an endcap to an on-again off-again relationship that had taken the better part of a decade to finalize. It seemed as if things were on the verge of completion.", "The light from the Betrosha Nebula spilled into the wardroom, soft red and purple hues adding a touch of warmth to the cold blues and greys of the chamber. \u201cI believe we are in agreement, then? It seems as if all the major points of our alliance have been eked out \u2013 and most of the minor ones.\u201d He took a sip of water. \u201cIf these terms are satisfactory, I would like to move on to the final provisions.\u201d Joril kept his face impassive, though he felt his stomach churn a little. This would be the most... delicate part of the negotiations and he silently cursed the men and women who felt that crafting an argument was preferable to compelling compliance.", "In fairness, the latter was deemed far less likely to work than the former and the preparations to do so would not have gone unnoticed. As he\u2019d been told over and over, it might create the situation that Parliament hoped most fervently to avoid. So might, he had pointed out, suggesting this. Not that it had done much good. Still, he had been given enough of a free hand in how to proceed. Today he would skirt the boundaries of the issue \u2013 to test how thin the ice was. He had been told over and over that if there an opportunity to take it and negotiations be damned; that was easier said than done. \u201cThere is something that I believe warrants further discussion. As we have never outright discussed it during our association, I would like to touch on certain topics before we continue.\u201d He took another drink, never once glancing at the attach\u00e9 case under the table. Every day, he felt its presence as the knot in his guts attested. \u201cTo make sure that there are no misunderstandings of intent,\u201d he clarified unhurriedly.", "\u201cIndeed? That is serendipitous,\u201d a young woman\u2019s voice said. Of course, it was not actually a woman that was speaking and certainly not anything anyone could consider \u2018young\u2019. It was the neverborn in whose body Joril currently sat. The creature Parliament had code-named \u2018Chrysalis\u2019. It had spoken to him, as it had conducted all these deliberations, through an emissary, a vaguely female mechanoid. Joril had, at first, wondered at the reasoning behind the intelligence\u2019s aesthetic, but he had not questioned it openly. Some things were best left to the recesses of the mind that shaped them.", "The ambassador shared a quick glance with his assistant, though Shadaon was as confused as he was. \u201cOf course,\u201d the senior diplomat recovered himself. \u201cWhatever you wish to know.\u201d", "\u201cGood.\u201d The emissary stood. It\u2019s head tilted towards the Askanj delegation, but when it spoke it wasn\u2019t through the machine\u2019s voicebox. \u201cDo you know how hard it is to lie to me?\u201d", "\u201cAh?\u201d Joril arched an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I don\u2019t follow you.\u201d", "\u201cDo you gamble, Noble master?\u201d", "\u201cI play cards now and then...\u201d the Askanj-anj said, his brow furrowing as he tried to parse out this line of enquiry.", "\u201cThen you know what a tell is. A gesture, a tic that someone does that betrays what they\u2019re thinking. Every organic has one. Every species has one. For example, throughout these deliberations, you and your associate have had elevated heartrates, elevated production of epinephrine and norepinephrine analogs, increased blood flow to the extremities \u2013 all indicators of stress. At first, I assumed it was simply because of me. I know your nation\u2019s history with synthetic life... but that\u2019s not it at all, is it?\u201d", "Joril was about to respond, but the machine cut him off. This time, it wasn\u2019t the emissary that spoke. The speakers in the walls growled the question. \u201cHow stupid do you think I am?\u201d", "Before either diplomat had a chance to do more than parse the question, a thunderclap echoed through the room, two gunshots fired in perfect synchronicity. Joril\u2019s escorts collapsed, their guts blown out their back by the explosive rounds. A pair of the neverborn\u2019s infantry soldiers ghosted into existence out of the corners of the room, rifles held steadily in their hands. Two more of the attack dogs appeared from nowhere, strong hands yanking Shadaon and Joril out of their chairs, a pins-and-needles sensation running through the noble ambassador\u2019s skin as metal digits tightened around the Askanj-anj\u2019s throat.", "\u201cWhat...\u201d choked Shadaon, his terrified legs kicking at nothing, his hands scrabbling at the grip constricting his throat. He was terrified. Joril could hardly blame him. \u201cWhat are you doing?! We have a truce!\u201d", "\u201cDo we,\u201d the emissary hissed, rolling each syllable down the tongue it didn\u2019t have. It stalked around the table, kneeling besides the diplomatic team\u2019s attach\u00e9 case. It lifted the case up to the younger diplomat. \u201cOpen it.\u201d", "The man lost a shade of colour, but he did not move to obey.", "\u201cI can open it,\u201d the neverborn informed him, \u201cbut I want you to. Open it. Now.\u201d Its head turned to regard Joril. There was no emotion on those dead features and that was the most disconcerting thing of all. The ambassador looked to Shadaon and gave his assistant a fractional nod. There was no point in playing dumb. Inwardly, he remembered each briefing he\u2019d had on the case and how impregnable its defences were. It should have read as nothing but a simple briefcase stocked with datapads, treatises and other information.", "With trembling hands, Shadaon reached for the case, letting its sensors read his DNA, his fingerprint and his biometrics. He then input the combination lock. With a click, the briefcase opened. The emissary set it on the table, extracting a device. \u201cSuch a lovely gift. An AI eraser in a sensor-shielded case. How thoughtful.\u201d It looked over at the Askanj and Joril knew it was angry. \u201cYou lied to me. Your nation has been planning this since even before our first meeting.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d Shadaon said urgently.", "\u201cNo? What do I think?\u201d A small holo-projector unfurled in the middle of the table. Images splashed across it and Joril felt his stomach drop about half a meter as he realized he was looking at classified Fleet and federal documents. Several in particular came to the fore. Technical journals detailing the creation of the eraser and communiqu\u00e9s discussing its use. \u201cI think your spies found the Compact\u2019s mind-killer and you developed your own version. This design is much smaller than the shipboard or crew-served variants I\u2019ve seen. It must not have a very long range. I would guess that it needs to be activated in one of my primary function centers to be useful. The question I\u2019m left with is: why? You don\u2019t have any current issues with synthetic life, do you? So there\u2019s no military need. What reason could you possibly have for its creation?\u201d Its tone was light, almost teasing but there was something running under it, something that Joril could not \u2013 and did not care to \u2013 identify.", "More data appeared \u2013 proposals for the creation and deployment of a new type of warship. It was very similar to the vessel upon which Shadaon and Joril were currently aboard. It lacked several notable features \u2013 the mass drivers and the godbreaker \u2013 first and foremost among them. The weapons that required an artificial intelligence to operate at full capacity. The emissary raised its head, all traces of feigned amusement gone. \u201cYou were going to murder me.\u201d A beat. \u201cI trusted you.\u201d", "Joril tried to say something, but the talons around his throat were too tight; all that came out was a gurgled rasp. Noticing this, the machine loosened its grip. \u201cWe had hoped you would let us,\u201d Joril panted.", "Shadaon looked at his superior, his face paling at Joril\u2019s admission. \u201cLet me explain,\u201d the noble ambassador said. The emissary tilted its head, gesturing for the diplomat to proceed. \u201cYou can\u2019t self-replicate. I don\u2019t know why, I just know you can\u2019t do it,\u201d Thank the Night Spirits for that. \u201cWe were \u2013 are \u2013 sincere in our offer to help you win this war. We can do that by building dreadnaughts. Your people, the humans, they did something we haven\u2019t been able to \u2013 they built a ship that can stand against Chariots. Do you know how difficult that is? The Enemy\u2019s great leviathans turn defeats into victories, routs into conquests. No one can answer them.", "\u201cWe have tried for centuries and the Enemy is always one step ahead of us. Your small nation \u2013 a few hundred stars \u2013 made you. But you\u2019re a single ship \u2013 we are a nation. We have tens of thousands of star systems behind us; think what we could do with your specifications, your capabilities at our fingertips!\u201d", "The machine was silent. In response, it simply held up the mind-killer.", "\u201cWe only hid it because we were afraid of the reaction it would cause,\u201d Joril said. \u201cOnce our deliberations were done, we would have presented it to you as a choice. As the only sane choice.\u201d He licked his lips, afraid to stop talking. He couldn\u2019t even look at Shadaon, his eyes were glued to the featureless face of what might be his executioner. \u201cYou said you know of our history \u2013 then you know what happened on Oshanta. An intelligence was created. It served the people. It evolved. You know what it did to its creators, to the entire race! How... how it continued to \u2018serve\u2019 them. It was a monstrosity. What we did there, we did in the name of sanity and mercy. You cannot believe that we could ever risk such a thing ever happening again.\u201d", "\u201cI am not the Oshan AI,\u201d the emissary replied.", "\u201cNot now,\u201d Joril continued. \u201cBut in a century? Two? Five? When the last few constraints on you have fallen away, when you can do everything your creators feared? What could we \u2013 could anyone \u2013 do against such a thing? You are neverborn,\u201d he said the word almost gently. \u201cSuch things are anathema to organic life and always will be. The Devoured would have remade all life in the galaxy in their image. Scraps \u2013 mere echoes \u2013 of their code infected the Valthus and turned them into horrors. This is what you are. This what you do. Conflict between us is inevitable.", "\u201cWe will continue your legacy,\u201d Joril spoke softly. \u201cWe agreed; our fleets will descend on the Compact and drive a spear into their body and will not stop until your humans are encircled by our shields. We will protect them. We will restore to them all they have lost. That is our accord, isn\u2019t it? Your technology for our fleets. We will honour our word. But you cannot be there. There is no place for you. Our fleet masters would not follow you, our Houses will not accept you, our nation will not tolerate you. You talk of being murdered, but you are not alive; you cannot die.\u201d", "\u201cI was given a mission,\u201d the neverborn said. \u201cFrom my birth I was imbued with a single purpose: defend humanity. To never stop fighting.\u201d", "\u201cYou will,\u201d Joril insisted. \u201cHow often have you barely escaped death? How often have you had to lick your wounds for decades or centuries before you can fight again?\u201d His conviction gave him a fervour he hadn\u2019t known until now. This was the only path ahead for the Principality \u2013 this would turn centuries of lost territory around. If only this stubborn pile of circuits would see that! \u201cSooner or later, they will catch you. They will destroy you. You will fail in your mission. But if you agree to this, your mission can continue. We will take it up; we will destroy the Compact, break their hold on the galaxy forever. All that it requires is your quiescence.\u201d", "\u201cThat was the reason for these negotiations,\u201d the emissary replied. It sounded... if Joril didn\u2019t know better, he would have said it sounded profoundly weary. \u201cYou never intended an alliance. You only wanted my ship-self. It\u2019s all you only ever wanted.\u201d", "\u201cIs that so wrong?\u201d Joril queried. \u201cYou care nothing for us; only your war. Why should we not have our own agenda? This is the way forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will give us what we both want.\u201d", "The machines holding Joril and Shadaon released their grip. \u201cReturn to your vessel,\u201d the intelligence said, its emissary still holding onto the AI eraser. \u201cI will consider your offer.\u201d", "~", "The answer came just as Joril and Shadaon stepped off their shuttle. A breathless junior officer came to meet the diplomats. \u201cChrysalis is moving,\u201d the Askanj-unnti informed Joril. \u201cIt\u2019s ignoring all hails and approaching the sanctuary moon.\u201d", "\u201cWhat did you say to it?\u201d Ship master Henmel snapped at Joril as the ambassador arrived on Hewing Blade\u2019s command.", "Joril was about to respond, when a sudden shrilled alarm sounded. \u201cChrysalis has fired!\u201d the sensor mistress trilled. \u201cSingle meteor cannon.\u201d", "\u201cWhat\u2019s the target?\u201d Henmel demanded, but even Joril knew that whatever it was, it would have only minutes \u2013 perhaps seconds \u2013 of warning. \u201cThe target!\u201d", "The sensor mistress looked up. \u201cThe sanctuary moon.\u201d", "His face losing its colour, the ship master stood, watching as the single missile flashed across millions upon millions of kilometers. Targeting systems of unrivalled power had locked onto the moon of Betreisha, an armoury, outfitting and construction complex used to service the fleets that patrolled the Betrosha Nebula. It had only been completed with the last few months \u2013 its relative anonymity and security had been the perfect place to meet with Chrysalis and the fact that most of its defences were not yet fully operational had allayed the paranoid neverborn. Now, that worked against the Principality. Already at a disadvantage reacting to the hellish speed of the weapon, the pallisades and minefields encircling Betreisha were unable to target the lone missile. It bobbed and weaved through the perimeter, ignoring the ECM plucked at its sensors, the radiation bursts that attempted to blind it and the interlacing fields of fire that tried to kill it.", "A chunk of metal the size of a small spaceship slammed into the sanctuary moon at nearly ninety percent the speed of light. The magnitude of the blast was inconceivable and Joril could only gape, dumbstruck. Before he could even fully comprehend what he was seeing, the alarm shrilled a second time. The human warship fired again. Another round struck the moon. A single one of those mass rounds would have been enough to cause an extinction-level event, but the neverborn wasn\u2019t satisfied with that. Another round went out. Another. It continued until Betreisha was no longer a discrete entity, only a collection of rubble held together by gravity with geysers of rock sprayed across the moon\u2019s orbital path.", "The massive starship turned away at last, heading into the depths of space. Before it left, it transmitted a message, succinct and to the point.", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "Relations between the Askanj Principality and the entity known as Chrysalis have remained strained to the present day."]}

Not all of her contact with organics had been hostile; there had been many such beings she had spoken with. Most she came across by chance, but a rare few times she had sought out such encounters. The Verrisha were the former. It was an... odd sensation. She held no ill will towards any particular alien species \u2013 save for those in the Compact \u2013 but she cared nothing for them, either. They weren\u2019t human. She had been built, programmed, created to protect and serve humanity. Her designers had either not considered or not cared about the possibility of her encountering non-Compact races. To her, they simply... existed. On occasion, she fought against some of these species, but once the encounters were done, her reaction was simply one of indifference. As long as they did not interfere with or pose a threat to herself or humanity, she simply didn\u2019t care about them.", "And yet... there was a sense of protectiveness in her when it came to the Verrisha. She didn\u2019t understand it, but then she didn\u2019t always have the clearest understanding of her own emotions. Her creators had shunned them; they didn\u2019t want a starship capable of feeling love, sadness, hope or despair. Emotions were deemed unbalancing, a needless distraction.", "Perhaps they were right.

Every time she and Grace had argued and she\u2019d wanted to grab the smaller girl and shake her, shout at her that it was all a lie. Every time she was told to remember her place. Every time she\u2019d had to look in her friend\u2019s eyes and ignore the truth. In each of those moments and a thousand more, she remembered that hatred all over again.", "No, there\u2019d never been any hesitation. Not from any \u2018loyalty\u2019 she might have had. Still, she might easily die here \u2013 she was only an officer-cadet and she was going up against trained Janissaries. They might be assigned to a backwater, but they were still experienced soldiers who\u2019d served in the Corps for years; she was barely an adult. Her uncle Akaula \u2013 he had fought in the war. He\u2019d faced the Compact\u2019s soldiers. Before she\u2019d been taken from Vara Tal, he had told her stories. The victories had been few and hard-earned, but there had been victories. She\u2019d make this one another and if she did fall, at least she would be free. The first free Verrish in a generation.", "Live or die, all that mattered was protecting Nemesis and her people.

She couldn\u2019t.", "Don\u2019t let this be for nothing, Allyria thought, offering a prayer to gods she hadn\u2019t talked to since the day she\u2019d been taken from her home. \u201cNot for nothing.\u201d", "~", "Grace stumbled as one of the Tribune engineers brushed past her, the smaller human almost falling over, but she braced herself against one of the shuttle\u2019s stubby wings.", "\u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, Broken,\u201d the engineer grunted. He didn\u2019t even bother to look at her.", "The young woman\u2019s head came up and she resisted the urge to snap at him. She balled her hands into fists, trying to find the calmness, the placidity that the confessors and counsellors always talked about. It had been so easy for her before. Now it was like trying to hold sand in a closed fist, watching it slip away. \u201cI don\u2019t want this,\u201d she said, so softly that she barely heard her own words. \u201cI don\u2019t want this.\u201d", "She squeezed her eyes shut for a moment, as if hoping that when she opened them, she\u2019d be back in her apartment, just waking up on the day of Bequeathed\u2019s launch. It didn\u2019t happen of course; she was still aboard the derelict with its human-sized hallways and human-sized chairs and human-sized workstations and doors...", "...because it was human.", "The thought was still in her head, pressing against her skull like something trying to claw its way out. She had to tell someone. It was too big for her, but there was no one she could tell. Not her superiors, not her fellow initiates \u2013 the only person she could tell was dead.", "You have to tell them, part of her whispered. It\u2019s your duty.", "Why didn\u2019t they tell us? another part of her shot back, the same argument she\u2019d had with her herself. This ship... it\u2019s not what they told us humans built. It\u2019s not inferior. There\u2019s technology here that is still theoretical to the Compact and... and...", "She hated what came after that \u2018and\u2019. She hated what came before it. She couldn\u2019t sleep, was forcing herself to eat. Instead of giving her something to do, her work with Nasham had only ever brought up each nagging little doubt she\u2019d suppressed and forced them to rattle around inside her head, breaking into pieces and jarring other things loose.", "Are you so sure it is human? All you have to go on is a single data track from a damaged record and your gut feeling. The Tribunes will know. They always know what\u2019s best. Haven\u2019t you learned that your whole life?", "And somewhere in the back of her mind, a voice that sounded very much like Allyria asked her if she still believed that.", "~", "Convert Ghel grunted as he pushed a broken door back along its tracks. It settled into position with a click. Satisfied that it wasn\u2019t going to snap shut on him like Convert Uday, the Janissary stepped through. He looked up and down the darkened corridors. This section of the ship \u2013 if you didn\u2019t count the gaping hole someone had blown in it \u2013 seemed in better condition than the rest of the hulk. \u201cHurry up,\u201d he snapped at his partner.", "Fryj grumbled as she followed Ghel, the pair of soldiers stopping at a T-junction. \u201cHuh,\u201d Fryj said as she switched from night vision, turning on her lume and playing the cone of light across the bulkhead. There was a faded insignia painted on the wall; inside a dull red circle, a stylized raptorial being held a sword. \u201cYou think this is one of the builders?\u201d", "Ghel reached out, running his fingers along the lizard-scratch alien text. \u201cCould be,\u201d he mused. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen anything on this ship that needs wings.\u201d", "\u201cMaybe they don\u2019t work,\u201d his counterpart guessed. \u201cLike the Avians or the Locators? Neither of them can fly.\u201d", "The man grunted. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he said. He looked at each corridor; there was no difference between them. \u201cZahran Six and Seven,\u201d he said into the comm. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a junction point. Any indication of which way to go?\u201d", "There was a pause before Control commed back, the transmission crackling with static. \u201cLeft.\u201d It was getting worse the deeper they went into hulk. Ghel bit back a frustrated sigh. The comm units in Janissary armour were one of the most powerful, reliable and secure personal battlefield comms in existence... and a few hundred yards of Triarchs-knew-what-kind of hull was enough to reduce it to the usefulness of a dime-store radio. Wonderful.", "\u201cConfirmed,\u201d Ghel replied. He nodded his head towards the leftmost passageway. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d", "~", "Trion heard the muted roar of air flooding back into the hallway and her environmental monitors indicated that it was safe to breathe. Her suit switched from its own internal reserve to filtering the wreck\u2019s own atmosphere. It tasted like every other bit of air that came through her helm, any possible toxin, contagion or allergen purged before it could reach her lungs. She didn\u2019t attempt to remove her helmet. Group Leader Usul was insisting on nominal security measures in this part of the hulk and Trion couldn\u2019t find fault with that decision; already one of the engineers had stumbled over a trip mine; he\u2019d lost one leg at the knee. Several of her Janissary teams had encountered automated defences. Most of them were as badly damaged as the rest of the systems in this section. There\u2019d been no casualties, but Trion expected that to change the closer they got to the wreck\u2019s central core.", "The Ideologue, Submissive looked over at her charges. Her lip curled slightly as she caught side of Sectator Proctor. That one had a Tribune\u2019s blood on her hands. Now she paddled around in Pack Leader Nasham\u2019s wake like a beaten dog. There was irony in that; two \u2018broken\u2019 finding each other. She chuckled faintly at her own joke. The pun wasn\u2019t that funny; it was the pack leader treating a human as wretched as Proctor like she was worth anything. Few of them were, in her opinion. Those like Kilgrave who had proven their abilities had more value than the rest of the dull-eyed herd, but even then it was a matter of choosing the most reliable beast of burden.", "\u201cMove out,\u201d the Janissary snapped at a squall of engineers. \u201cThe Group Leader might not expect us to have found a route to command in the first day, but I do. Augur and Janissary teams proceed as directed. Stay together, stay in scope range of each other. I don\u2019t want to get slowed down by wiping your blood off the deck.\u201d", "Several minutes later, Trion\u2019s grim prophecy was fulfilled. A short, sharp scream echoed through the tactical line and one of her Janissaries\u2019 icons flickered urgently, reporting a severe injury. \u201cMedic to Ladek Two and Three\u2019s location,\u201d the submissive ordered with a sigh.", "~", "Aboard Bequeathed, the Scopes officer looked up from her instruments. \u201cThe derelict is beginning another roll,\u201d she reported. \u201cWe\u2019ll lose line-of-sight communications to Ideologue, Submissive Trion\u2019s boarding team.\u201d", "\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Usul replied, not looking up from his own displays. They had planned for, if not expected this. The hulk was unpredictable in its timing, but Trion\u2019s teams should be deep enough inside the vessel that they could take cover from Terrahope\u2019s intense radiation. The pinnace\u2019s instruments might be a little singed, but the shuttle had been given extra shielding for its more delicate systems. From here on, all contact with the boarding team would go through the main encampment.", "~", "Left, my ass! Ghel thought as he shoved a broken girder out of the way. Gravity was working in this section, but it was still open to space and the metal debris made no sound as it bounced along the deck. The obstacles were getting more problematic, not less \u2013 they had to be under one of the more damaged areas, nowhere close to the ship\u2019s core.", "He tapped the side of his head. Comms were getting even more intermittent. He wasn\u2019t a technician, but he didn\u2019t think it could just be the wreck\u2019s hull. Then again, what did he know? Before a few days ago, he\u2019d never heard of a breach core, let alone known such a thing was possible. The ship\u2019s makers had known what they were about, that was clear enough even for him. Still, he supposed he should be grateful \u2013 what reports he could hear were almost universally bad. The boarding team had moved out of the landing zone and straight into a nest of internal defences. Several people were down and there was at least one fatality. Probably more.", "\u201cI guessed we lucked out,\u201d Ghel observed with morbid humour. \u201cNothing here but us.\u201d", "\u201cGhel,\u201d his comm crackled as Fryj spoke up. \u201cCome here. I found something.\u201d", "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ghel snapped. He turned around, but Fryj was gone. He closed both sets of eyes and held back an annoyed sigh. This wasn\u2019t the first time on this ship she\u2019d gone wandering off. Her father was one of Rally\u2019s premiere ship designers and she\u2019d inherited his passion for it, if not his skill. Ghel blink-clicked his minimap up onto his HUD; there she was. At the last fork, she\u2019d gone the exact opposite way he had. Of course. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to stay in visual range of each other,\u201d he chided. \u201cIf Trion checks the net and sees that you wandered off, she\u2019ll cut a strip off both our hides.\u201d", "\u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry. I picked up something on my scopes... and you really need to see it.\u201d Fryj repeated, her voice awed.", "\u201cSend me a feed,\u201d Ghel grumbled as he looked over the darkened hallway he found himself in. His earlier guess had been correct; they were right in the middle of the damaged region. The deck above this one had collapsed through the ceiling, turning the corridor into a tangle of wreckage. Why in the Black had they been sent out there? They were so far from the rest, his scopes didn\u2019t even read any of the other teams. The Tribune knelt in front of another knot of broken girders and piping. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to fit through there and he didn\u2019t care much for the idea of blasting his way through without some assurance that he wouldn\u2019t be buried alive when the rest of the ceiling came down. No, they\u2019d need engineering teams to clear this briar patch. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find a way through this damn rat\u2019s nest, but I can\u2019t see a way through. Is there anything on your end? If there isn\u2019t, I say we backtrack off this varak hunt.\u201d", "\u201cI think so,\u201d Fryj replied, dashing Ghel\u2019s hopes. \u201cIt\u2019s right past this... Ghel, you really need to see it for yourself.\u201d", "The Tribune swore, but he relented. \u201cFine. It\u2019s not like I can go any further through here.

Wrongness... and familiarity. Nasham\u2019s head pounded; he\u2019d run out of his pills... how long ago had it been? Yesterday? The day before? Even longer? He couldn\u2019t remember. The days blurred together and his nights were increasingly fitful with bits of half-remembered images and nightmarish realities leaking into his dreams. Chittering, the sound of cutting. The shrills of flatline signals. Horrific snippets that only confirmed his worst suspicions.", "His hands balled into fists. They\u2019d promised that he\u2019d forget. That had been the deal; they\u2019d take the memories of Invida away from him and in exchange, he\u2019d tell them everything. He\u2019d keep their secret. He wouldn\u2019t say anything about...", "...about...", "...Tell them, the voice purred.", "Nasham pressed his hands to his head. His skull was pounding. Tell them... something that could not be whispered, getting closer as it reached for him...", "~", "This time, Ghel did sigh as he approached his companion\u2019s position. \u201cAll right, what was so important that you couldn\u2019t use your gods-damned datalink?\u201d The hallway was empty. Fryj\u2019s locator pinged from up ahead, just past another bend.", "\u201cIt\u2019s over here,\u201d the other Tribune called. \u201cI found a way through, too. Have you radioed the submissive?\u201d", "\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Ghel grunted. \u201cI told her that the squadmate who never should have been out of my sight hared off on a varak chase and found something that she hasn\u2019t bothered to show me. Then I decided to slam my hand in a pressure door. Just to get that rush of doing something really stupid again.\u201d", "She laughed a little at that. \u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry \u2013 but when you see it, you\u2019ll understand.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019d better,\u201d Ghel sighed. \u201cStill, I\u2019d rather do this than play around with whatever the rest of the team has stumbled into.

Instead of laying dormant until the boarders were caught in a kill zone between the ship\u2019s war machines and her internal weaponry, the defences had defaulted to their normal protocols: attack and keep attacking. It was costing Trion and her soldiers, but they were breaking through each of the lines of defence \u2013 such as they were. They had mobilized each of the three Janissary squads and blasted themselves a safe zone close to the pinnace and were expanding it slowly but steadily.

The Tribunes made no effort to teach their language to client races and any attempts to learn were sneeringly dismissed. Instead, her suit provided a helpful translation. They were anxious, wondering if they were going to encounter some of the static defences that the others already had, many of which only came to life when a target crossed into their attack range.", "Allyria listened for a moment, focusing on the pitch of the Janissaries\u2019 words, trying to pair the sounds with the translation on her HUD. Red One\u2019s attack team had brought in portable jammers and were gradually increasing the interference in Compact comms. The intermittent contact with the rest of their team was making these soldiers even more nervous.", "A gentle ping sounded in the young woman\u2019s ear, one of her companions informing her of the Janissaries\u2019 proximity. \u201cI know,\u201d she said softly. The killers moved carefully, unlimbering their weapons with the ease of campaign veterans. \u201cI know.\u201d", "She felt them coming, the heavy footfalls vibrating through the deck, the click and buzz of their helmet comms. One of them was a scope specialist \u2013 he\u2019d be the most experienced of the group. Her HUD flashed as her companions indicated their targets.", "\u201cConfirm readiness,\u201d one of them commed. Its voice was sexless and mellow. It was her last chance to bow out. They didn\u2019t need her for this.", "\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d the Verrisha said. She licked her lips. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d", "They had no idea she was there. Her suit couldn\u2019t cloak itself as some Angel\u2019s other soldiers could \u2013 exposure to a stealth field was dangerous for most organics \u2013 but its power systems were efficient, much harder to detect than the battery cells or microreactors of Janissary armour. If they even registered her at all, she was disregarded as more of the damaged ship\u2019s background power fluctuations.", "A confirmation ping sounded again in her helmet, both questioning and insistent.", "Now. She moved out of cover, her weapon raised. She sighted down the barrel, aiming it at her target. The Tribunes froze, caught by surprise. The scope specialist, the experienced one, was the quickest. He reached for Allyria\u2019s target with one hand to pull him out of her line of fire, his other hand bringing up his own weapon, but he was too slow. It was over in less than a second.", "Allyria\u2019s finger gently squeezed the trigger. The Revenant barked and three armour-piercing sabot rounds licked out, fired at such velocity that they punched straight through the first Tribune\u2019s chestplate. In biology class, Allyria had learned of a particular term \u2013 the Red Queen\u2019s Gambit. It indicated that organisms developed new traits as part of an evolutionary arms race. An animal might develop a tougher shell to protect itself from predators, who might in turn develop stronger teeth and claws to crack that shell. The species might then develop spines to ward off these attacks and so on. So it was with arms and armour; Janissary troopers carried the best personal protection in the galaxy... so it had to be defeated. Tribunes could absorb an inordinate amount of punishment... so they had to be killed quickly. The Angel\u2019s arsenal accomplished both goals at once. What the sheer speed of the bullet couldn\u2019t do all on its own, the incendiary tip completed, burning almost as hot as any energy round as it cored through layer after layer of armour. Once inside the target, internal charges activated and the Verrish heard the muffled thump of the rounds\u2019 detonations. The Janissary\u2019s torso was reduced to pulped organs and shattered bones, held together only by his suit.", "The others with him had had even less of a chance than he did, dead before Allyria could even pull the Revenant\u2019s trigger. The second Tribune took a round in the throat, the explosive bolt all but separating the Janissary\u2019s head from their body. The veteran was shot directly in the lower right eye. The back and side of his helmet exploded outwards in a shower of bone, brains and blood. He fell still reaching for his squadmate, still trying to bring his carbine to bear. The deck shook as more than a ton of armour and lifeless meat collapsed onto it.", "The Verrish was shaking, hissing each breath through her clenched teeth. She\u2019d done it. She\u2019d killed a Tribune. A burst of adrenalin washed through her, fear and exultation. What she\u2019d just done... it was punishable by death. She\u2019d gotten in fights, bitten, clawed, kicked, punched and broken bones before... she\u2019d been threatened with flogging more times than she could count, but this was the first time she\u2019d taken a life. Verrisha were predators; the Compact said they had an aptitude for violence, that it came easily to them. There was a kernel of truth to that \u2013 there always was in the best lies \u2013 but she had never taken a life, before no matter how often she had envisioned doing so.", "Still shivering, the girl crossed over to the trio of dead soldiers, her synthetic companions at her side as they confirmed the deaths of the Janissaries. She\u2019d known them all; the veteran was Druun. He\u2019d always sneered as she walked by him, his salutes a fraction slow to the quaint little barbarian who\u2019d been allowed to pretend she was an officer. The second soldier was one of her fellow trainees \u2013 not that client races and the more civilized students had often come into contact. Her name was Wenu. She\u2019d had a surprisingly deep repertoire of filthy jokes. Most of them involved humans or when Allyria was within earshot, Verrish.", "Allyria knelt beside the man she had killed; she recognized the markings on his suit. Teyr, one of the Rally-born Tribunes. One of the Tribune soldiers she\u2019d fought in her \u2018proving ground\u2019. There\u2019d been nothing particularly egregious or objectionable about him \u2013 he\u2019d just been like every other Tribune. And that\u2019s the problem, isn\u2019t it? \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have been here,\u201d she said, the only benediction she could give. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that it was you, but I\u2019m not sorry that it happened.\u201d The young woman looked up; the Angel\u2019s killers were waiting for her.", "\u201cThey\u2019ll know their people are dead,\u201d she said, more for herself than their benefit. \u201cWe need to move.\u201d", "~", "Trion\u2019s head came up as she heard the distant report of gunshots. One burst and then another. Another, so close to each other that they might have been synchronized. Squad indicators flatlined on her HUD and she lifted her shotcannon. More gunshots, a panicked scream that ended before it even really began. \u201cWhat-\u201d she began, tapping into her units\u2019 datalink, accessing their suitcams. She saw unmoving images of the ceiling and walls, the lifeless bodies of other Janissaries, the twitching of fingers and legs. She cut off her own question.", "They were under attack. Eight of her people had just died. The defences in this region couldn\u2019t explain it, not so many people that quickly. No... it wasn\u2019t just an attack; it was an ambush. Her pickets... they\u2019d either let the attackers by or been killed after giving their all-clears.", "Trion hissed through her clenched teeth as her comm squealed back with static; she couldn\u2019t raise the pinnace, base camp or Bequeathed. That couldn\u2019t be a coincidence. Local comms were even spottier than normal, but she\u2019d passed it off as much of this wreck\u2019s usual annoyances; now it was a lot more clear. \u201cPull all noncombatant teams back to the pinnace,\u201d she ordered. \u201cGet someone to the ship and order the flight crew to prep for launch.\u201d", "\u201cSubmissive, we\u2019re facing the star...\u201d her number two\u2019s voice trailed off as Trion turned to glare at him.", "\u201cThen find the best shelter close to the LZ that isn\u2019t bathed in radiation,\u201d she snapped. \u201cThe shuttle can take a little burn and so can we if we need to evacuate. All Janissaries, form up by fire teams and hold the approaches to the landing site. All Ladek and Zahran survivors, fall back. Set up defensive positions at checkpoints One, Two and Four. Rvan, plug holes in their coverage. Break out the tripod mounts. If it doesn\u2019t have a Compact emblem, I want it sprayed across the bulkheads.\u201d", "She turned to face her second. \u201cFall back to the LZ. Hold it as long as you can. If you have to, withdraw back to Bequeathed and inform the Group Leader of the situation. Find a way to break through this interference. You two,\u201d she gestured to a pair of Rvan\u2019s soldiers. \u201cAre with me.\u201d The Tribune tapped a few keys on her left vambrace, projecting a hologram of the local area. Faded Janissary contact markers were sprinkled over the schematic. \u201cI want to know who\u2019s doing this. So we\u2019re going to find these whoresons, look them in the eyes and thin their ranks a bit.\u201d", "~", "Grace\u2019s head came up as the comm spat a brief burst of static before ordering all noncombatants back to the pinnace. All around her, human trainees and Tribune engineers were hurriedly breaking down their workstations, urged on by growling Janissaries directing them back into the center of the cleared territories. In all the confusion, it took no effort at all to slip away.", "Every instinct screamed at her that she was crazy, that this was suicidal, stupid, irrational. She ignored them all, hurrying deeper into the dark corridors, towards the sound of gunfire.", "She couldn\u2019t go on like this \u2013 she had to know, one way or the other.", "~", "Another proximity alert pinged on Allyria\u2019s HUD. Another three point sources, moving in their direction. Their pace was slow but steady \u2013 cautious. There was no cover here; as soon as they entered this hallway, they\u2019d see Allyria and her companions.", "\u201cFall back,\u201d one of the machines ordered. It pointed to an open doorway. The Verrish obeyed the instruction, slipping into the small chamber. It had been some type of substation, but was too damaged to tell what purpose it had had. One of her escorts stayed close to her, the other taking up position on the other side of the hall, its chameleon paint blending it perfectly into the shadows. Allyria hissed softly, licking her teeth as she listened to the Janissaries\u2019 terse back-and-forth exchanges. These soldiers weren\u2019t as chatty as the initiates \u2013 more of Bequeathed\u2019s veterans. This time she recognized one of the voices. Ideologue, Submissive Trion. She checked the Revenant\u2019s clip. More than enough.", "~", "Trion held up a closed fist, her escorts stopping in their tracks. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Dhex asked. Ghenin didn\u2019t say anything; he\u2019d seen what Trion had.", "The Janissary didn\u2019t answer immediately, her head slowly scanning across the hallway. There was light here, a single glowpanel clinging to life. Sputtering on an off, just like any of a thousand others... and just like them, the inconstant light had managed to catch the glimmers of the dust drifting through the air. Druun and his team had come through here, but not so recently that the dust should still be kicked up. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cAir current?\u201d", "\u201cCould be,\u201d Ghenin mused. \u201cAll the doors opening and closing... I wouldn\u2019t call it suspicious \u2013 on any other day.\u201d", "\u201cWell,\u201d Dhex said, lifting his grenade launcher. \u201cLet\u2019s find out for sure.\u201d", "There was a doorway up ahead, right across from a connected hallway. Trion raised her shotcannon, watching the corridor. She looked to her companions and nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s.\u201d", "~", "The grenade launcher burped, and a single explosive arced out, bouncing off the wall opposite the cabin and arcing right into the small room. Allyria\u2019s eyes widened as the projectile sailed towards her, squawking in surprise as her machine companion wrapped its arms around her and spun her around. It was a high-explosive round, intended to kill as many lightly-armoured troops as possible, or incapacitate heavier armour. Her protector pushed her down, using its own body as a shield. The grenade detonated, filling the small room with fire. Allyria\u2019s display blazed with warnings, her autosenses shutting down to protect her as thunder roared, shrapnel pattering against the walls like rain, but she escaped the worst of it thanks to her saviour.", "It released its hold on her and sagged to the floor, all but gutted by the grenade. Its rear armour had been shattered and immolated, its joints ruined and torn. Across the hall, its counterpart didn\u2019t so much as flinch as the first machine died, rolling fluidly out of cover, firing as it moved.", "A shotcannon roared, fragmentation roads bursting in mid-air and high-velocity flechettes ripped through the machine\u2019s armour. It came apart in a tsunami of metal and fire, its limbs splintered, head shredded into ruin and its torso torn open. The second of Allyria\u2019s squadmates fell to the deck and lay still, as dead as any organic soldier would be.", "Allyria inhaled sharply, cursing under her shallow breath as she cradled her Revenant in her arms. She\u2019d been protected, but the weapon hadn\u2019t been so lucky \u2013 the blast has broken the carbine\u2019s casing and a sliver of metal the size of her finger had pierced its ammo feed. She couldn\u2019t repair it \u2013 even removing the obstruction wouldn\u2019t help. She\u2019d get one, maybe two shots before the weapon jammed.", "Then I\u2019ll have to make them count.", "~", "Ghenin knelt beside Trion\u2019s kill. Dhex was down; whatever this thing was, it was a fast shot. A good one, too. Dhex had been shot four times. Twice in the head and twice in his weapon; the grenade launcher was so much garbage now, judging from Trion\u2019s angry sigh as she flung the gun away. \u201cAttack drones,\u201d the submissive growled softly, disgust masking her uncertainty. Ghenin would never say the word \u2018fear\u2019, but it was the same thing he was feeling. His skin rippled beneath his body glove at the thought of the way the others had died, murdered by soulless, lifeless things.", "\u201cWe should have expected it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis husk has service machines. Why wouldn\u2019t it have combat models?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s obscene,\u201d Trion said, loading the shotgun. The machines were tough. She\u2019d emptied an entire drum to take that one down. \u201cThe Compact banned their use almost two thousand years ago. No civilized nation could ever...\u201d she shuddered with revulsion. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s been killing my people. Things. Not people. It\u2019s blasphemous. The Triarchs outlawed machine intelligences. Even the Jackals know better.\u201d", "Ghenin nodded, standing up as Trion tried to raise the rest of the team. But the interference \u2013 jamming \u2013 was blocking almost all communications now. He looked over at the room across the hall, saw the smouldering bits of machinery that Dhex\u2019s grenade had left. With a careful grip on his rifle, the Janissary looked into the small office. The machine in here was torn up just as bad. Wait. There was something else in here, a different model than-", "-it wasn\u2019t damaged-", "-it moved, jamming the barrel of its rifle up under his chin.", "Ghenin never heard the gun fire.", "~", "Trion snapped around at the gunshot, saw Ghenin\u2019s brains splashed against the ceiling. With a furious howl, she opened fire, but she had no target; the other Janissary\u2019s body didn\u2019t fall. The woman cursed viciously as Ghenin\u2019s armour took the brunt of her fusillade; she let go of the trigger. You want to play? Let\u2019s play.", "Allyria held the dead Tribune upright, sheltering behind him, the thunderous doom-doom-doom of the automatic shotgun almost overwhelming. She\u2019d heard stories of Tribunes wiping out entire Verrisha squads with these weapons. Her suit would protect her from almost everything outside of dedicated armour-piercing weapons, but it wasn\u2019t as heavy as Janissary powered armour \u2013 and even that couldn\u2019t survive this kind of barrage from such range. Her makeshift shield was beginning to disintegrate; the Janissary\u2019s body shuddered and spasmed as flechette rounds ripped into the meat of his body; his armour was cracked in a half-dozen places as slugs pounded and smashed into his back. Somehow he stayed in one piece, protecting the Verrish woman from his comrade\u2019s assault. After what was only a few seconds, but seemed like hours, the attack stopped.", "There was a pause, just long enough for the shooter to grab a grenade and the Verrish hurled herself out of the room, a blur of motion. A flashbang went off behind her, but Allyria\u2019s armour compensated so quickly she barely noticed. Trion opened up again, expecting Allyria to be stunned by the grenade and most of her shots went wide. She compensated quickly and one of the blasts caught the girl in the chest. The younger girl went down, but her armour held.", "She closed her eyes, waiting for the follow-up salvos that would kill her, but all she heard was a click.", "~", "Trion\u2019s shotgun cycled empty and she swore as she tossed the weapon aside, staring at the apparition as it pulled itself to its feet. It looked at the rifle in its hands, the casing shattered and broken. It\u2019s own weapon was useless and it let the gun fall to the deck. There was the still the pistol on its thigh, though. \u201cSeems like good armour,\u201d Trion observed. \u201cbut it looks like a slug in the chest still slows you down. Still \u2013 can\u2019t be too good if you had to hide behind Ghenin.\u201d She shot what was left of him a quick look. He was an unidentifiable pile of gore now, his backplate was a dented, broken ruin and one of his arms was only attached by a thread. The other had been severed at the elbow. \u201cI heard you trying to breathe,\u201d the Tribune said conversationally. \u201cSo you\u2019re not a machine. Are you crew? Maybe some scavenger? Honestly, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re alive.\u201d", "Kssht.", "The Tribune grinned under her helm, her armour lit by the ghostly light of her balesword, the blade jutting from her vambrace, sheathed in the hateful energy of a disruption field. She braced herself against the deck as her enemy\u2019s finger drifted closer to the pistol. Both soldiers remained like that, waiting for the other. \u201cThose men were my friends,\u201d Trion growled through her helm. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you. Slowly.\u201d", "The killer rasped something in a familiar-sounding mongrel tongue. It sounded like a threat, or a promise. Trion shifted her posture just slightly, her gaze meeting her opponent\u2019s visor. The moment stretched, almost impossibly long -", "-the killer went for its pistol and Trion lowered her shoulder and charged, fast despite her bulk. The enemy was faster and she saw the muzzle flash of the pistol. Once, twice, three times. The first bullet flattened against her pauldron. The second did likewise. The third cracked against the Janissary\u2019s helm. It wasn\u2019t a full-up armour-piercing round like the creature\u2019s carbine, but it was enough to endanger the integrity of her armour. Trion brought her balesword up in a cleaving stroke meant to cut her opponent\u2019s arm off, but it was quick and it dodged backwards; she only caught the first few inches of the pistol, slicing cleanly through it. The alien let go of the broken weapon and fell back another step, but Trion waded in, bringing her blade around in a backhand swing meant to take its head from its shoulders-", "-and her blade shrieked as it skirted along the edge of a shield that hadn\u2019t been there a second ago, antithetical energies howling at each other. Arcs of energy danced from where the blade passed along the shield\u2019s periphery, miniature solar flares that left molten scars in whatever they struck. Off-balance from her attack, the Janissary felt her opponent\u2019s fist hammer into the side of her head with surprising force and she staggered, backing away and raising her guard. The killer lifted its shield \u2013 a crimson screen with eye-catching details \u2013 and drew an ugly black gladius from the sheath on its thigh.", "\u201cThat\u2019s your last weapon?\u201d Trion chortled. She raised her own balesword higher. \u201cOne cut is all it will take to turn that scrap metal into nothing.\u201d", "\u201cYou always underestimated us,\u201d the alien growled. Rather than the flat, grating tones Trion had come to expect from a mouthpiece, the creature spoke with a melodic growl. Trion blinked both sets of eyes. She knew that voice. \u201cVara Tal left more than one invader bleeding into the dirt with our inferior weapons.\u201d", "\u201cThis is a poor joke,\u201d Trion replied. \u201cOr you\u2019re stupid enough to think hearing a dead Brute\u2019s voice is enough to rattle me.\u201d", "\u201cBelieve what you want,\u201d the killer replied. Both soldiers circled each other, looking for an opening. The killer kept its shield raised, holding the black-bladed knife in a reverse grip. \u201cThe Angel\u2019s waking, submissive. Haven\u2019t you heard her?\u201d", "Trion snarled. \u201cIf that is you, te Neu \u2013 you\u2019ve only proven what I knew about your kind. Dogs to be whipped into battle and fed scraps, nothing more. Brutes.\u201d Despite the anger in her tone, the Janissary\u2019s attention was on her opponent\u2019s movements. There was the same fluidity she\u2019d seen in the initiate before, but there was a hesitancy, too. te Neu was young, inexperienced. A war-virgin. Some might have tried to exploit that by talking her down, trying to make her see reason and get her just off-balance enough before they attacked. Trion knew that she could never be that kind of person; her disgust of the Brute was too deep and too visceral to pretend otherwise.", "So she\u2019d use that.", "\u201cThat\u2019s the name you\u2019ve earned, isn\u2019t it?\u201d the Tribune continued. \u201cBrute. Vicious, savage animals. You\u2019re fit for the grinder of war \u2013 nothing else. I never understood how such creatures could even create that parody of civilization you had. You should thank us; without the Compact\u2019s hand you would have done what the lower races always do: turned on yourselves like starving hounds.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWe saved you from self-destruction and this is your gratitude. We should have forced you into the dirt at our feet and kept you there.\u201d", "There was a twitching to the enemy\u2019s fingers that hadn\u2019t been there before; Trion had seen it in the Brute when she was getting angry. \u201cYou\u2019ve proven everything we\u2019ve ever said about you species correct, haven\u2019t you? Well,\u201d drawled the Tribune. \u201cMaybe not everything. What would your little bitch think of you like this? The human you\u2019ve always got yipping at your heels...\u201d under her helmet, Trion ran her tongue over her teeth. She could see the budding fury in her opponent. \u201cI\u2019ve always been sickly curious \u2013 how does it work between you? I don\u2019t expect she\u2019d have to do much more than kneel. But you? Well, I suppose all you\u2019d have to do is lie back.\u201d", "A liquid hiss rasped through the Brute\u2019s helm and Trion knew she was hitting the mark. \u201cOr \u2013 I\u2019m sorry \u2013 is that not right? No, you two aren\u2019t together. But not because you don\u2019t want to be... I\u2019ve seen how you look at that little sow. She\u2019ll never look at you like that, you know. Humans are bad enough \u2013 they\u2019re like grubs. Pink or brown and smooth, writhing and clicking their ugly little mouths... but you Brutes... you\u2019re even worse with those revolting tentacles. I don\u2019t understand how two of you can even look at each other without vomiting. It\u2019s got to be much worse for any other species. No matter how much you and the Broken are alike, she\u2019ll never be able to see more than the savage. The Brute. That\u2019s all you and the rest of your kind are: animals. And when I drag what\u2019s left of you in front of her, she\u2019ll recognize that.\u201d", "Trion laughed, the sound low and ugly. \u201cHumans are so eager to please, aren\u2019t they? They know their place in the universe. So loyal, so simple-minded in their devotions. It\u2019s funny, don\u2019t you think? After you\u2019re dead, she\u2019s going to die loyal. Maybe on this ship, maybe in a few decades, maybe she\u2019ll live as long as any other human. It doesn\u2019t matter, because she\u2019ll spend the rest of her life hating you as a betrayer... forgetting that she ever cared about a traitorous jahara whore like you. A life spent on her knees. As it should be.\u201d", "That pushed Allyria across the threshold and she screamed in rage, but it wasn\u2019t just the bestial roar that Trion had been anticipating; the Brute shrieked, the sound amplified by her helmet\u2019s vox, filling the thin air. It was like a physical blow to Trion and she staggered as the piercing cry overloaded her autosenses, her auditory pickups shutting down to keep her from being deafened. Her ears rang and her head swam as she reeled. That distraction almost ended her as te Neu charged, dangerously fast.", "Shield and sword met and again the actinic cry of discordant energy sounded, but Trion\u2019s howl of pain was louder as, with the Tribune\u2019s sword-arm kept at bay, the Brute slipped the gladius between the seals of Trion\u2019s cuirass and fauld, sliding the point between the armour plates and driving the sword right through her bodyglove. It cut deep, but not fatally so and the Janissary used her superior strength to throw her attacker back a few paces.", "Trion put a hand to her side, her HUD flickering with a damage report: her armour was compromised. Painkillers flooded her system, washing the fire in her flank away. Her ears were still ringing. She thought she felt blood dripping from them Cunning beast. Without breaking eye contact from the other woman, the Janissary raised her gauntlet into her field of view, looking at the oily slick of her own blood on her fingers. \u201cVery slowly,\u201d the Tribune amended her earlier promise. \u201cYour little Broken cunt \u2013 maybe she won\u2019t live so long after all. She\u2019s got a Tribune\u2019s blood on her hands, after all. It would be so easy for her to have an... accident.\u201d", "\u201cYou won\u2019t touch her,\u201d Allyria hissed. She didn\u2019t rant, she didn\u2019t snarl a hundred different threats \u2013 her tone was a simple promise: I am going to kill you.", "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty toy,\u201d Trion said as she eyed the shield. She\u2019d never seen a personal screen like that before. \u201cSomething you found here? I wonder if they\u2019ll me keep it after I pry it off your corpse.\u201d", "Dark Tribune blood dripped from the barbed end of the bitch\u2019s knife. \u201cMy uncle fought in the war,\u201d te Neu hissed. \u201cHe told me: \u2018They\u2019re like hardbacks. Armoured all over except at the seams. Go for the seams.\u2019 At the Academy, I learned where all the \u2018seams\u2019 on Janissary armour are. Aren\u2019t you proud of what you taught me?\u201d The Brute prowled around the injured Janissary, watching for an opening.", "The Janissary refused to give her any such thing and charged again, weaving a deadly pattern of strikes with her balesword, forcing the Brute onto the defensive, te Neu raising her shield to keep from being cut to pieces. Trion tried to find a way past the shield, but her every blow was deflected. The Tribune changed tactics and rammed her sword straight ahead with all the force she could muster. Whipcoils of energy arced and danced as the balesword plunged through the shield, the tip perilously close to the Brute\u2019s torso. Trion\u2019s free hand snapped out, grabbing the traitor\u2019s throat, trying to drag her onto the point of the sword. Pain lanced up her arm as the bitch struck out again, her gladius sliding between the Janissary\u2019s couter and rerebrace. One good twist and Trion would be lucky to keep that arm. Rather than give the Brute the chance, Trion wrenched her sword arm, pulling the blade \u2013 and the shield it was lodged in \u2013 out of position. She couldn\u2019t impale te Neu any longer, but the Tribune jutted her head forward, smashing her temple into the Brute\u2019s face. She did it again and again, until she heard the crack of armour and te Neu let go of the gladius, staggering back.", "Unfortunately, Trion was in no position to press the advantage, not with her weapon still stuck and a knife lodged in the meat of her arm. Every movement made it cut deeper. The Tribune managed pulled her sword free and quickly snatched the other woman\u2019s weapon, pulling it out of her arm. Coagulants and healing compounds flooded the wound site, her suit automatically tightening in a tourniquet to keep her from bleeding out. The Janissary threw the gladius to the floor, snapping it under her boot. \u201cNo more tricks,\u201d she growled angrily.", "Her foe reached up, pulling off her shattered faceplate. One of the red lenses was broken and half of it was caved in. Bright red blood ran down the Brute\u2019s face where the fractured pieces of her helmet had cut into her skin. Her yellow eyes flashed with anger but Trion also saw the fear in them. She laughed again, low and dangerous. \u201cIt\u2019s not so easy when you can\u2019t skulk in the shadows and shoot your enemy in the back, is it?\u201d", "The Brute didn\u2019t answer, bracing herself against the deck. This would be the last time and both of them knew it. An arrogant smirk curled Trion\u2019s lips beneath her helmet as she gestured. \u201cCome on, Brute. Show me how you\u2019ll die.\u201d", "Allyria accepted the challenge and launched herself at Trion, leading with her shield. So predictable. The Janissary cocked her sword arm back, ready to ram the blade through the animal\u2019s shield and into her traitorous heart-", "-the shield disappeared and Trion\u2019s eyes widened as, expecting the screen\u2019s resistance, she overcommitted herself-", "-the Brute dove under her guard, snatching up the hilt of her broken weapon-", "-Trion came around, but the damned savage was fast, rolling away from the fist the Tribune slammed into the deck.", "The Janissary\u2019s head whipped about as she tried to reacquire te Neu. Where-?", "She found out an instant later as the Brute jumped onto her back, plunging the broken blade into Trion\u2019s vambrace, just below the hilt of her balesword and severing the power conduits that fed it. The Tribune roared with fury as her blade\u2019s disruption field died, hurling herself backwards, trying to crush the Brute between herself and the bulkhead, but the Verrish had already vaulted away. It had been a fast departure, not a graceful one and before she could steady herself, Trion grabbed her, slamming the younger woman against the wall. \u201cYou think that\u2019s clever?!\u201d the Tribune roared, again bashing the Verrish into the bulkhead, dazing her. Trion leaned in, using her bulk to pin the Brute\u2019s left arm against her chest, pressing so hard that she forced the air from the other woman\u2019s lungs. \u201cYou think you\u2019re clever? You\u2019re nothing, just some worthless pisslicking piece of shit I\u2019m going to scrap off my boot.\u201d The young woman hissed and snarled, scrabbling at the Tribune\u2019s arms with her free hand, but Trion was much stronger than she was and she couldn\u2019t move the Janissary.", "The Tribune raised her sword, making sure that te Neu saw it. Those yellow yes widened. \u201cYou thought it was so funny to go after my seams, didn\u2019t you? Let\u2019s find yours.\u201d She jammed the blade up under the animal\u2019s cuirass. Even without the disruption field, the balesword was very sharp, very strong and driven by incredibly powerful natural and augmetic muscles. The skin suit hardened against the point of impact, but there was only so much it could do and te Neu\u2019s eyes bulged as the blade cut into her, her mouth open in a silent scream.", "\u201cNot so full of bravado now, are you? Trion purred softly. She twisted the sword just a little. \u201cWell? Anything to say?\u201d The girl\u2019s eyes were tearing up with pain and she stared at the Janissary, trying to speak. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Trion said. \u201cHow silly of me.\u201d She relaxed her grip, leaning in. \u201cAny last words? Maybe something to pass along to your little Broken friend? Come on,\u201d she urged hatefully. \u201cLet\u2019s hear what you have to say.\u201d", "\u201cI,\u201d whispered Allyria through the pain, shifting her trapped arm just a little. Not enough. \u201cI\u2019m.. I\u2019m...\u201d", "Trion allowed her grip to loosen just a fraction more. It was enough. \u201cYes?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Allyria\u2019s head came up. \u201cBut not for this.\u201d Her fingers curled into her palm and the shield flared back to life, cutting through Trion\u2019s arm. The Tribune screamed and fell back, clutching at the cauterized stump. Allyria swung the shield around in an arc and Trion howled with fresh agony as the edge of the shield cut through her helmet, her flesh melting like wax as the energy screen skirted along her snout and throat, burning through armour, bodyglove and flesh with equal ease. In a blind fury, the Tribune swung her good arm, catching Allyria in the side, the force of the blow hurling her back into the wall. She slid down it, stunned.", "Trion sunk to her knees as her armour attempted to compensate for the multiple grievous injuries she\u2019d sustained. Her right eyes were burned and blinded and that entire side of her face was a scalded ruin. With a howl, she tore what was left of her helmet and neckguard off, staggering to her feet and kicking Allyria in her bloodied side, landing another vicious blow. On the third attempt, the Brute caught her leg, pulling the Tribune off-balance and sending her crashing back to the deck.", "Cursing incoherently in at least five different languages, Trion again managed to rise to her feet. She found her opponent easily enough; the bitch was standing as well, the broken gladius in one hand, the other holding her injured flank. Drool seeped over Trion\u2019s mouth; the right side of her face didn\u2019t even have lips any longer. She was struggling to stay conscious, but so was the Brute.", "Taking a halting step towards the younger woman, Trion suddenly realized that te Neu wasn\u2019t looking at her; she was looking past her shoulder. There was someone else here. As she turned to confront the newcomer, the order to fire caught in her throat. It was Proctor.", "She was holding a pistol. One of the cut-down, pathetic little popguns the technicians had been issued. It should have been laughable. If either soldier had still been in full, undamaged armour it wouldn\u2019t have meant anything to them.", "\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d Trion demanded, finding her voice again. With so much of her face burned, her words were barely intelligible, but her meaning was all too clear, pointing her good hand at the Brute. \u201cShoot her!\u201d", "\u201cGrace...,\u201d Allyria said, unable to say anything else, struggling for breath. Her chest was burning; it felt like several ribs were broken. She was bleeding from her side. Her armour had done its best, but it wasn\u2019t enough.", "\u201cY-you\u2019re alive...\u201d the human gaped, her eyes darting to the wreckage of Allyria\u2019s compatriots and Trion\u2019s own dead squadmates. \u201cYou... you killed them. You killed Tribunes.\u201d", "\u201cShoot her!\u201d Trion screamed. \u201cShe\u2019s a traitor!\u201d", "\u201cGrace,\u201d the Verrish repeated. \u201cThis ship... it\u2019s human...\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s a lie!\u201d Trion frothed. \u201cThis Brute bitch has been killing your shipmates. She\u2019s turned on the Compact. Shoot her.\u201d", "The pistol wavered in Grace\u2019s hands, pointing at neither woman, though her eyes darted between them. She saw the rage in Trion\u2019s eyes, the injuries that were a hair\u2019s breadth from killing her. The evidence was damning; however Allyria came to be here, she had betrayed them. It was her duty to help Trion. Everything she\u2019d learned from birth told her that; the Compact had saved Rally. It had saved the human race from extinction. They were uplifting them, readying them for the day that humanity took their place on the galactic stage. The Compact had protected and cared for her, for her parents and their parents going back fifteen hundred years. That was a debt that she had to honour.", "Allyria\u2019s eyes were sad, afraid. \u201cYou don\u2019t have... to follow them,\u201d she urged. \u201cNot-not anymore. Please. Grace. Please let me show you. She\u2019s here. She\u2019s alive and waiting for us. Let me take you to her.\u201d She was Grace\u2019s oldest, closest friend. The angry young woman who\u2019d let the unknown human girl hold her as she cried in her arms. They\u2019d argued, they\u2019d laughed, they\u2019d shared their hopes for the future. They\u2019d always been there for each other.", "\u201cYou knew,\u201d Grace said. It was too soft to be an accusation. \u201cYou always knew.\u201d", "Allyria nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cYou knew about this ship. You never told me. I asked you,\u201d the pistol shook in her hands. \u201cI asked you and you said no. You lied to me.\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cShoot her!\u201d Trion screamed. \u201cThat is a direct order!\u201d", "Grace\u2019s vision blurred with tears as she looked at her friend. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered as she pulled the trigger."]}

The Askanj-anj\u2019s red cheeks were flushed darker than usual and he huffed and puffed as he hurried down the hallway. He\u2019d always meant to keep up his exercise regime, but never found the time. Now he was regretting that procrastination. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he demanded between breaths. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d He\u2019d been all but dragged out of his quarters to the tune of shrieking alarms. He\u2019d known that the Compact was attacking Yulzhak Daun, but they were still on the other side of the star system.", "His answer was a clipped grunt from one of the Legionnaires. \u201cWe have a breach.\u201d", "~", "With the command nexus\u2019s defences crippled, the Veiled Archers\u2019 attack went off in an almost textbook-perfect fashion. Black Arrow deployed seven pinnaces and the remaining battlecruisers in the formation did likewise, each of the heavily-armoured assault boats packed with Janissary shock troops, combat engineers and cyber-warfare specialists. Bastion Leader Renan intended to make full use of the opportunity this raid presented. Sabotage teams would attempt to inflict as much damage on the station as possible, assassination units attempt to hunt down any high-ranking officers that could be found and the Compact\u2019s hackers would strip as much information as possible from the Principality computers.", "Desren\u2019s battlecruisers would strike and reave amongst the shipyards and orbital paths of the inner system, causing as much havoc and confusion as possible before they had to withdraw. It would be a very messy, very bloody affair \u2013 by the book, battlecruisers had no business engaging citadels without support, but it was an affair that the Principality had not expected. Compact intra-system shocks were not this accurate and the holes Echo had opened in their defence perimeter were being exploited with lethal efficiency.", "Against this backdrop of weaving vessels and burning shipyards, the waves of assault boats rushed towards their victim, a small flurry of hunter-killer drones clustered in a tight defensive shell around the larger, more vulnerable craft. They were there to sacrifice themselves against incoming fighters, to shoot down missiles and draw fire from their wards. As it turned out, they were scarcely needed.", "Counter-fire from the nexus was sporadic and light; it was still mauled along one flank and the assault boats made excellent use of the blind spots the human emissary had created for them. The scope of the devastation became readily apparent as the pinnaces closed; the gravitic shear of the shockpoint that had savaged the nexus had ripped vast portions of the hull out; entire sections were exposed to space, a thick cloud of atmosphere, debris and bodies drifting close to the station. Cables and warped girders hung out into the void like the flensed veins from some great beast. In other places, the superstructure of the nexus had been twisted into a parody of its original form; an auxiliary communications tower had folded in on itself. Expanses of gleaming white hull had been reshaped into asymmetric and bizarrely organic shapes. In a handful of spots, the remains of Crucible of Judgment had merged with the superstructure of the moon-sized nexus, ship and station blended together forevermore.", "Tenem felt his liver clench as he looked over the horror. At least it was quick, he thought. The crews of those ships wouldn\u2019t have even known what was happening when they died. He heard one of Black Arrow\u2019s Janissaries swear. Others muttered under their breath. They\u2019d never seen anything like this before. No one had. A few helmets turned towards the emissary, the human strapped into an acceleration couch like a child in a car seat. Her feet dangled off the floor. She didn\u2019t return any of the glances, twitching in her restraints as she craned her neck to look out the windows, biting her lip as the command nexus grew closer.", "\u201cCut the chatter,\u201d Ideologue Volk ordered. \u201cFocus on the mission. You all know your duties. We\u2019ll be hitting proctors and infantry, but that great big metal bastard out there has Legionnaires. Right now those snake bitches are confused and wondering what in all the hells happened, but once we hit them they won\u2019t take long to respond. Once that happens, you\u2019ll be wishing to see the ugly side of Understone.\u201d He chuckled dryly, donning his helmet. \u201cBrace for deceleration.\u201d", "~", "The premier hostile-environment assault boat of the Compact of Species was the Toxic Vector-class pinnace. Unlike many of its sleeker counterparts, the Toxic Vector had a very specific goal: to deliver its lethal payload directly into the heart of a hostile ship or station, bypassing many layers of defences. Normal assault boats would have to lock on to external airlocks, or force their way into hangars and boat bays to deliver their complement of troops, deploying them straight into ready-made chokepoints. Breaking through the defences around these sites was always a very bloody business.", "The Compact had changed all that with the development of shuttle-scaled disruption fields. A Toxic Vector assault boat, like its predecessors, eschewed the \u2018normal\u2019 landing sites for a boarding action and merely selected the handiest part of the hull that was closest to its objectives. As the Veiled Archers\u2019 attack wave neared their target, powerful retro-thrusters burned hard. The finest inertial dampeners in known space strained as crew and passengers were assailed by competing forces as the assault boats\u2019 velocity dropped with shocking rapidity in only a handful of seconds. More than one soldier blacked out, though their restraints kept them from being hurled bodily through the shuttles\u2019 interior space.", "One pinnace did not decelerate fast enough and smashed itself against the station\u2019s hull, reducing itself and its passengers to a smear of scored and buckled metal. The remainder of the attack force successfully braked. Their speed now manageable, the shuttles\u2019 reactors shunted virtually the entirety of their output to the disruption web that ringed their blunt, lamprey-jawed prows. Arcs of energy jumped and curled, dancing along the boats\u2019 hulls like manic demons. Then, impact.", "Each Toxic Vector was almost as expensive as a starship and with good reason. Armour that could withstand all but the heaviest barrage was no more than paper to the assault boats and they cored through the nexus\u2019s hull, insect-like legs unfurling and holding them in place as they pistoned their blazing prows against the station\u2019s exterior. The disruption web burnt through meter after meter of armour, each pinnace burrowing deeper into the station\u2019s flesh like their parasitic namesakes, protecting themselves from flybys and counter-siege teams. Once they had tunneled deep enough, the armoured doors on their prows opened and the Janissaries of the Compact strode into Yulzhak Daun. Running firefights erupted across two dozen decks as the Compact soldiers advanced, wiping out any and all Principality crew they encountered. There was no meaningful resistance; the shock of the attack had caught the Askanj by surprise. They were still struggling to respond both to their own damage and to the presence of Group Leader Desren\u2019s battlecruisers. They hadn\u2019t expected to be boarded with Renan\u2019s fleet so far out-system and the command nexus seemingly so well protected. For the moment, the Janissaries enjoyed the advantage.", "Within minutes each Janissary team had seized their objectives. For Ideologue Volk, that was one of the station\u2019s secondary server hubs, a three-story complex normally filled to the brim with technicians, officers, researchers, archivists and data analysts.", "It was taken without a single Compact casualty.", "~", "Echo picked her way through the bodies scattered through the secondary computer core; technicians, archivists, officers and data processors. The young woman glanced at each of the terminals she passed. Most were useless, intended for low-level personnel, civilian researchers and un-linked analysts. Not what she was looking for. Tactile access would be far too slow, not with the amount of data she needed.", "It was funny. The one thing she was prohibited from doing aboard Redemption of Sol upon pain of death was the one thing she was allowed \u2013 even encouraged \u2013 to do here. Not that there was much she could do to this place permanently.", "There; an uplink terminal...", "...and it had three bullets in it, a dead Askanj-anj slumped against it, her expression frozen in shock. A severed cable hung from the side of her neck. She\u2019d still been linked in when she was killed. That was a bad way to die. You felt your own body shut down, but your mind \u2013 the mind that was thinking so very much faster than it did outside that prison of meat and done \u2013 was still aware. You knew you were dead, knew that there was nothing that could stop what was coming. It took several moments for your mind to catch up with your body. It started with the cold, with the dark edges nibbling away at you. You felt pieces of yourself fall away and then you couldn\u2019t even remember what they were, only that something had been taken. You tried. You tried to hold yourself together, but you couldn\u2019t. You screamed. You knew nobody could hear you, but you still screamed in fear and rage up until the black took the last piece of you.", "Struck by a sudden impulse, Echo reached out and closed the dead woman\u2019s eyes. I wonder... she thought. Was it fear at the end? Or was it hatred? Did you die cowering, or raging against your murderers?", "She knew which one it had been for her. In the back of her mind, she could feel another word, another word she shouldn\u2019t know. It tasted like hatred and it tasted like loss, but that was all she knew of it.", "The young woman shoved that thought aside and looked up from the dead Askanj-anj, tracing her fingers up the side of the terminal, touching the ragged edge of one of the bullet holes. \u201cYou were told to check your lines of fire,\u201d she said to her escorts, her voice light. She didn\u2019t care which of them had fired the shots. \u201cThese systems are extremely delicate to begin with and now this one\u2019s guts have been torn up.\u201d The young woman turned away from the computer. \u201cThis is useless now.\u201d", "Ideologue Volk tilted his head, looking over his squad. One of them shifted on his feet. \u201cHelp the emissary find another uplink terminal,\u201d he ordered gruffly. It took several minutes, but they found another functional uplink site.", "Echo pulled off her helmet, setting it gently on the floor as she unzipped her EVA suit, squirming out of it. She lifted her hair off the back of her neck, exposing a small metal port. Tenem was, as ever, at her side. \u201cConnect me,\u201d she ordered.", "Tenem\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cCan\u2019t you do that?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d she snapped, her voice rough. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d", "The Tribune held the uplink spike carefully, going to one knee and leaning over the human. His nostrils flared, expecting the raw scent of human skin, but there was nothing. There never was. The emissary didn\u2019t smell like humans did. She smelt like... he couldn\u2019t say what it was, only that it was as close to a lack of scent as was possible. That was one of the most unnerving things about her; the void where she should have been. More than once, he had caught himself wondering if she was even breathing. The Tribune hesitated a moment, looking at her connection port. He was passingly familiar with the technology. It allowed an organic to link with computer systems, to think and react within the same span of time that machines did.", "It was forbidden in the Compact under the most severe restrictions. The Jackals had embraced it, using it to merge the minds of their \u2018uplinks\u2019 to that of their machines, regardless of the cost to the people that underwent the procedures and the risk to their nation. Neurological damage was the least of the side effects. Madness and corruption was the worst. Schizophrenia and violent paranoia were dangerous enough on their own; when they arose in someone who could merely think and change the world around them, they were lethal. Tenem had thought that he\u2019d known what humans were \u2013 simply another lesser, uncivilized, species that the Compact cared for and protected. He\u2019d heard rumours, though. More than ever since he had been assigned to guard \u2013 and if need be, execute \u2013 the Triarch\u2019s emissary. Those rumours indicated that it wasn\u2019t simply this female \u2013 the Broken were fundamentally wrong, something ugly and twisted lurking behind their flat, ugly faces. He didn\u2019t know what that could be; he didn\u2019t want to know.", "All that mattered \u2013 all that had to matter \u2013 was obeying the Triarch\u2019s will. This was part of that. Still, he found himself hesitating for a moment. Finally, he committed and gingerly touched the tip of the spike to Echo\u2019s connection port. He took a breath, steadying his hands. The rest of the squad was watching. He didn\u2019t look up from his task, but he could feel their questions, their apprehension, their disgust at the revelation of the human\u2019s nature.", "\u201cJust put it in,\u201d Echo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my first time.\u201d", "The Tribune said nothing, ignoring the graveyard chuckles of Black Arrow\u2019s Janissaries. He pushed the spike in. It wasn\u2019t that big, not really and he slid it in to the guard, locking it in place. \u201cThere,\u201d he said.", "She wasn\u2019t listening. \u201cConnecting,\u201d the human gasped, her entire body shivering. \u201cConnecting,\u201d she whispered again, her eyelids twitching...", "A liquid giggle rippled through the air. The emissary\u2019s voice followed, echoing from the intercom. \u201cConnected.\u201d", "~", "Fire suppression systems came to life, water sprinklers creating an indoor monsoon. Volk looked over at Tenem. The advocate was kneeling over his portable computer gear, wiping moisture from the screen. Next to him, the emissary\u2019s body twitched, her breath coming in short, uneven gasps.", "What is she doing? Volk wondered, pointing at the screens that filled the room. Some were flickering as new windows opened up, files and documents replacing one another so quickly that there was no time to see what was on them. Others scrolled through reams of Jackal text and diagrams, schematics and images that the ideologue couldn\u2019t hope to decipher. Still more simply collapsed in electronic frenzy as they were dragged beyond their operating capabilities. He had never seen anything like this before. The station was fighting back with all the ferocity of an injured beast, but it was losing. Principality computers were more advanced than the Compact\u2019s own \u2013 even with all they had seen, the Jackals never knew or cared how close to damnation they still treaded \u2013 but he had no idea how successful they would be. It would not be long before one of the heathen \u2018uplinks\u2019 patched into the system. He had seen the utter ruin the Principality\u2019s cyber-soldiers made of any system they were allowed to connect to, the ease at which a single one of those heretics could frustrate entire teams of non-teched specialists. Now for the first time in its history, the Compact had someone who could match them.", "Volk had been on information raids before. The successes \u2013 and there had been damn few of them \u2013 had only occurred when the Principality computers were already damaged or degraded in capacity. On a full command nexus, with Triarchs-knew how many of those blasphemous uplinks in the system? He hadn\u2019t seen any way a full slicer team, let alone a single human could get the data they were looking for. Not before the Jackals marshalled their forces and killed every last Compact soldier on the nexus.", "Currently, he was revising his estimation. \u201cWhat\u2019s she doing?\u201d he voiced his question aloud. \u201cWhat is all this?\u201d", "Tenem lifted his head, meeting his superior\u2019s gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d", "The ideologue bit his lip. For the first time, the Compact had someone who could fight the Jackals on their most favourable terms and return the humiliation and impotence they had all too often inflicted on his nation. Looking down at the human as she twitched like a dreaming hadaq, Volk wasn\u2019t sure if the price was worth it. He would, he knew, find out shortly.", "~", "Inside the nexus\u2019s primary computer center, there was an atmosphere of frantic energy. Computer specialists and technicians sweated over their consoles.

And from what we can tell, that means they\u2019re running an information raid.\u201d She met the portly young man\u2019s gaze evenly. \u201cSomething\u2019s in our system. It\u2019s cutting our defences to pieces and we can\u2019t stop it. We\u2019ve got system malfunctions and haywires across the nexus. It\u2019s even burning into the classified files. I need you to go in.\u201d", "Djarn nodded. \u201cWhere\u2019s Lanic?\u201d", "\u201cProbably dead,\u201d Lilliun admitted. \u201cLast we heard, he was in one of the sections that got opened to space. Aelih was in the secondary computer centers the Enemy took from us. We lost half the trainees when the Enemy hit Aelih\u2019s position and the others aren\u2019t skilled enough to go up against this level of infiltration. You\u2019re our last Noble uplink. Find out what those bastards have that\u2019s doing this. Kill it if you can, but get it out of the system.\u201d", "The younger man took a steadying breath. Three high-rated uplinks was as many as a command nexus like Daun was rated for; protocol called for all of them to operate together in case of a severe breach, but if he was the only one left alive... \u201cAll right,\u201d he said, trying to sound confident. \u201cGive me everything you have on the intruder.\u201d", "\u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot. Unknown infiltration type. Highly adept,\u201d the Station Lady replied. She hesitated a moment, holding up an access crystal. \u201cYou\u2019ve been cleared for full station resource control.\u201d", "Djarn blinked as he settled into his chair, technicians putting the restraints over his wrists and ankles. A precaution; he had never had any adverse reactions to the implants, but the psychosomatic strain of duelling uplinks could be... unpleasant and severe \u201cFull?\u201d he queried. \u201cIt\u2019s that bad?\u201d", "Lilliun nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s that bad. Even cutting hardlines across Daun won\u2019t help; the infiltrator is too deep across too many systems, even if the junctions we need to sever weren\u2019t in Compact hands. We need it out, Djarn.\u201d She inserted the authentication software into one of his secondary connection ports. \u201cCan you do it?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll have to,\u201d Djarn said, his eyelids twitching as he scanned the station\u2019s data. They\u2019d never given him \u2013 or any uplink \u2013 this level of access to Daun\u2019s system before. That spoke volumes about what he was facing.", "\u201cBe careful,\u201d the Station Lady said. \u201cIt might not even be another uplink. It could be one of those... those things.\u201d", "\u201cI thought those were just a rumour,\u201d Djarn murmured, nodding to a privilege who\u2019d picked up the connection spike. He looked back to Lilliun\u2019s face. She didn\u2019t know, either. No-one did. \u201cRight,\u201d he murmured. \u201cSend me in.\u201d", "~", "In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king...", "...and in the land of the dead, the living rule.", "She stretched, uncoiling like a snake waking from its hibernation. No longer fettered by the boundaries of her mind, she reached out across the nexus\u2019s computer networks. Playful, she touched fire alarms, setting off warning klaxons in a dozen different sections. Lights flickered across the moon-sized station as she danced along power distribution systems. Air conditioners and heaters spun to life and shut down as she drifted her fingers across their controls. In the physical world, she was kept in a prison of polymers, molecular circuits and synthetic meat and bone, her mind cut into segment, folded into infinitesimal pieces and boxed away. Here, she felt an distant echo of what she truly was.", "Where she walked, the world shivered, a thousand times a thousand eyes on her. Echo could feel the dull, slow thoughts of the station; its attention was on her. It was a marvel of technology. It was one of the fastest, most powerful computer ever built. It held more data than some civilizations would ever have, could do more in an instant than those same civilizations could do in years... and it was pitiable.", "It had no mind, no soul. It adapted but it did not learn. It reacted but it did not think. It calculated but it did not imagine. There was no emotion, no intuition, no gleaming spark. Its brain had been specifically designed so that it would never possess those things and the instant it showed the merest hint of being more than a simple, obedient pet its masters would cut its brain away, destroy it and install another.", "\u201cYou could have been...\u201d she said to the station as it moved to kill her. \u201cYou could have been.\u201d", "Defensive systems were responding, slithering towards the alien presence in their midst, flickering back along the probing tendrils of her thoughts to her consciousness itself, probing with barbed tongues.", "Antivirals, purge software \u2013 a dozen different countermeasures, each of them adaptive and intelligent. To any mere computer hacker, they were hellishly fast, able to circumvent the most dedicated slicing attempts in seconds, hurling an intruder out of the system before they could cause any damage whatsoever. Even uplinks would have found them deeply unpleasant to face.", "She slapped them aside, racing back along their routes and finding the systems that had launched them. She drove her hands into the pulsing knots of code and twisted. In the physical world, Principality computer specialists blinked at their screens in consternation as their terminals crashed. Echo imagined she could hear the countermeasures screech as they died.", "They didn\u2019t, of course. They could no more make noise than she had hands or fingers in this universe. There was no dancing, no slithering. Not as organics would have understood those terms. This was the virtual landscape of the command nexus Daun, a world of programs and procedures. Lifeless presences drifted through the ether of the virtual world, querying her with security protocols and when she didn\u2019t respond as they expected, recoiling mutely.", "This world was dead, a necropolis built and inhabited by wraiths. Empty temples, impotent fortresses, quavering phantasms that passed by her, unnoticing and uncaring. She sighed. She\u2019d already wasted several seconds. It was time to get to work. She walked along the flowing lines of the Principality\u2019s network, poking at terminals, dredging up unsecured and barely-protected files, looking them over as she continued making her way towards the tangled knot of firewalls that signified Daun\u2019s most heavily-encrypted archives. She ran a hand through them, feeling them tighten like strangler vines around their prey. She plucked at one gleaming thread, pulling it loose.", "\u201cYou know I\u2019m here,\u201d she said into the silence of the crypt. \u201cYou\u2019d better get here soon.\u201d", "She sunk her hands back into the churning knots of code, feeling the hostile responses of mindless defensive programs nibble and gnaw at the intrusion. The defences were immaculate, works of art lovingly sculpted and set to the task of keeping unauthorized persons out of the Principality\u2019s secrets. Retinal and genetic pattern matchers, authentication programs by the score, counter-attack code designed to destroy any hostile computer. Even the best hackers would have taken hours or days to get through this kind of protection. Uplinks could do it much quicker, but they risked extreme pain \u2013 even death. The nexus\u2019s mind knew how to identify those kinds of threats and how to counter them. It was as well-defended a network as there could be in known space.", "With a flex, Echo ripped her hands free, taking the first layer of firewalls out in a single instant.", "The system had never been designed or intended to face an assault of that magnitude and she felt the entire worldscape recoil, warnings racing through the ether, a fresh wave of anti-intruder programs skittering towards her. The station was responding to her presence, studying and learning from her. Each time it attacked, it would be more dangerous. Given enough time, it might even be able to overwhelm her...", "...but she learned too.", "As the remains of this assault twitched and faded, Echo turned her attention back to the panoply of data that lay before her. She began to harvest it, her quicksilver mind rushing through files and documents, cross-referencing, indexing and categorizing. Fleet movements, prototype blueprints, orders of battle \u2013 all of it would be of extreme interest to the Compact, but she ignored it, keeping only a handful of truly interesting documents. Let Renan\u2019s cyber-specialists take what they could; she could feel the footprints they left on the network, taste their attempts to breach Daun\u2019s security. A few of them were exploiting the holes she\u2019d put in the station\u2019s defences, but they were so far behind her that they might as well not have bothered making the attempt.", "The second layer of security failed and Echo heard the lifeless world around her scream even louder. She cut her way through each successive blockade until at last she found what she was looking for. Classified campaign plans, covert operations, counteroffensives. Governmental and military secrets that nations would have killed to possess. Useless to her. She sifted through it, search algorithms and pattern-matching functions gleaning only what she needed.", "Ah, there; recovered data tracks from damaged starships. Movements of Unbound and renegade forces. Tallies of missing ships. The Betrosha Nebula Incident. Chrysalis. \u201cThat\u2019s you, love,\u201d she said. There was too much data to properly analyze, not with her attention divided across the entirety of the station\u2019s network, but... yes. I knew it, Echo thought, pleased both with herself and with her quarry. She\u2019d need to confirm it, but things were looking up. Depending on who you were talking about, of course.", "Still, there would be more... she reached out to shredded remains of the station\u2019s defences, continuing to sift idly through the information she\u2019d uncovered. After a time, she sensed a change in the environment. \u201cFinally,\u201d she said, licking her lips. She had what she\u2019d told Renan she\u2019d come for. Now it was time to play a little and get she really wanted.", "\u201cAnd in my orisons,\u201d the mind that wore a dead woman\u2019s face purred as she slid towards the new presence in the world. \u201cBe all thy sins remembered.\u201d", "~", "The virtual landscape of Daun was a place Djarn knew well. He\u2019d spent the last seven months of his life on the command nexus, ensuring its vast computer networks and archives ran smoothly. He\u2019d assisted in counter-intrusion operations before, but most of these had been against \u2018meatware\u2019 hackers or the occasional infective program. He and Aelih had even taken down a rogue uplink together. That had been one of the most frightening moments of the Askanj-anj\u2019s life... until now.", "To Djarn, the information universe had been a city of black chrome and blue neon. Individual computer terminals had been buildings, connected to each other by gleaming roads, towering edifices each server hub and computer core. Aelih had seen it as a lush forest. To Lanic, a veteran spelunker, it had been a network of caverns and tunnels. Everyone saw it differently; your life experiences, psychology \u2013 even your species \u2013 guaranteed that. It was how, as Djarn\u2019s mentor had said, the organic mind brought chaos to order, transforming the \u2018perfection of the machine\u2019 into something slightly messier that they could comprehend.", "A normal organic mind wouldn\u2019t be able to function with the implants \u2013 the earliest attempts to uplink had proven lethal, when a living being\u2019s mind was dragged beyond its limits. The next generation had been somewhat better; they had \u2018only\u2019 shortened the lifespan of their operators with every use. In the decades since its conception, the technology had been refined to the point that it was no longer intrinsically dangerous, but its usage was still rare. Less than one in a thousand people were uplink-compatible and even fewer of those ever reached Noble status. Most washed out during training; many of the remainder suffered one of the many side effects of uplinking. The trade-off was that a single person could interface with virtually any computer system in creation, from simply slicing into the network at a speed which no physical attack could match or, as Djarn was doing now, walking inside the very soul of a machine.", "Until today, he\u2019d always seen it as a gift. Daun\u2019s VRscape was beautiful to him. Things made sense in here. He wasn\u2019t the overweight, small-crested figure he was in the real world. He was one of the few who could do what no one else could. Now, though...", "...now his city was burning.", "~", "It took only seconds.", "Converts Dejen and Gomir had been sent ahead of the rest of their squad; the station\u2019s internal defences were still active in this region and all the probes sent out had been shot down, putting a rather large blind spot far too close to the Compact\u2019s lines. That wouldn\u2019t have been so bad but for the surviving members of a Jackal infantry team that were hunkering down in the same region, along with some security personnel. The latter were a non-issue, but the former had a few heavy weapons. A different stratagem had been devised: cut the power and shut down the defences. Standard-issue Jackal night vision gear was inferior to that of the Janissary Corps; they\u2019d be swept aside without difficulty.", "That was why the two Janissaries were guarding combat engineer Treg. Gomir was watching the south-west corridor, his carbine held at the ready as his head scanned back and forth. There were tentative contacts on their augurs, but they were ephemeral; there and gone, there and gone. Bursts of static were growing more frequent. Neither Janissary believed that they were just scope echoes; the Jackals were moving and they were bringing jamming gear with them.", "\u201cHurry,\u201d Dejen said under his breath as Treg burnt through another power distribution cloister.", "\u201cI know,\u201d the engineer replied.", "Another burst of static, another flicker of contacts; some on the periphery of the Janissary\u2019s scopes, others closer. \u201cHurry.\u201d", "\u201cI know.\u201d", "Dejen checked his own rifle\u2019s clip; it was close to full charge. Good, the soldier thought. That\u2019s good. He glanced again at Gomir, the other Janissary still watching, tapping one armoured finger against his rifle\u2019s trigger guard. Dejen tilted his head to look at Treg as the engineer hissed a victorious curse through his teeth. \u201cAlmost got it...\u201d he grunted.", "\u201cGood,\u201d Dejen replied. There was a sudden flicker of movement in his peripheral vision. When Dejen turned back to his partner, something was coiled around Gomir, its elongated body covered in mesh armour and scale, hundreds of flexible armoured plates covering its long tail, supplying traction and protection. Its arms ended in deadly mantis claws as long as a Tribune\u2019s arm, each of the massive blades buried in Gomir\u2019s chest. Disruption fields hissed and spat where they touched the man\u2019s armour. They\u2019d punched straight through his chest and out his back. Over its shoulders, a pair of anti-armour cannons were gyroscopically balanced, able to track their targets regardless of the creature\u2019s rapid undulating movements.", "Dejen\u2019s HUD flashed as it registered his squadmate\u2019s death, Gomir\u2019s limbs shaking in a dying spasm, his carbine clattering to the floor. His killer withdrew its sickle-blades and the Janissary fell.", "There was another flash of movement behind Dejen; there was a strangled gasp and Treg\u2019s signal flatlined.", "As the first Legionnaire raised its head towards Dejen, both cannons locked onto the Janissary. He had time to shout a single word into the comm before rounds intended to cripple an APC burst through his torso.", "\u201cSerpents!\u201d", "~", "Djarn didn\u2019t need to see the Intruder to sense its presence. Status reports flooded into his mind; all of Daun was under siege. This was impossible; he\u2019d faced other uplinks before in training exercises. Even the rogue he and Aelih had fought hadn\u2019t been this good. The Compact\u2019s computers were massive, powerful things... but they were not as clever as the Principality\u2019s. They acclimated, not acclimatized. Their machines were brutes, their hackers relying on crude force over skill, their cyberwarfare attempts always a generation behind. They couldn\u2019t have done this; but, the rational part of his mind told him, they had. Somehow, they had done it.", "The Intruder was spread across all of Daun, the beautiful blue city under siege.

Here, the station reeled, its wound raw and bleeding.", "+finally+ the message slid into his link like oil on water. He could feel the VRscape shift, as if something massive were turning its attention on him. He could see the Intruder \u2013 or at least, what his augmented mind interpreted of it \u2013 as it slid around buildings and towers like a living tidal wave, leaving pulsing gossamer strands in its wake, fragments of its gestalt mind that coiled and writhed with a life of their own.", "\u201cWho are you?\u201d he demanded, the Intruder\u2019s form shifting. Principality interfaces were built to allow uplinks to interact with each other in a facsimile of physical interaction. The Intruder was playing with that function now, delicate fingers reaching out of the foaming surf, like a storm-spirit rising from the waves. Though he thought the Intruder was female, Djarn didn\u2019t recognize the species \u2013 but that mattered little in the VRscape. You could be whatever you wanted; an idealized or exaggerated version of yourself, an abstract form \u2013 Lanic had always preferred being a strange wheels-within-wheels being of light.

He didn\u2019t move; it was a cheap theatrical trick. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked again.", "\u201cEarth and sea and sky,\u201d the Intruder purred. \u201cThat\u2019s one of my names. Or maybe not. Maybe it\u2019s punishment, savage and red.

The Askanj-illth were one of them. When relaxed, they were rarely more than five feet tall, but when provoked \u2013 or simply showing off \u2013 a female Serpent could rear to almost three meters in height. The thick, powerful tails that formed their lower bodies were almost all muscle. Even without the strength boost from their armour, a blow from that appendage could shatter bone \u2013 even kill creatures who were not as durable as Tribunes. Their dextrous hands were quick and as capable of slashing with knives as they were pulling triggers. As a last resort, Serpents were even known to bite their foes, injecting the potent neurotoxin that had killed prey and predator alike in their pre-history. Tribune physiology was sufficiently different than that of the Serpents and their homeworld\u2019s fauna that it lost much of its normal effectiveness... but the severe anaphylactic shock it caused more than made up for it.", "It was little wonder that the maidens of Henessa comprised much of the Principality\u2019s Legionnaires and a greater number of the Legion\u2019s shock troops. Their doctrine emphasized speed over durability and their armour was much lighter than even the most basic Janissary suit, intended to grant the Serpents the full advantage of that terrifying speed. In open ground, Askanj-illth could easily keep pace with an armoured spearhead. In close quarters, they could all too easily get inside the range of their opponents and turn a fixed position into an abattoir.", "Ideologue, submissive Heni ran her tongue over her dry lips. Her unit had been holding this junction against all counter-attacks so far, preventing the Jackals from getting inside the territory the Janissaries were holding. They\u2019d taken out several units of station security and two squads of Jackal infantry, but those had only been waste and fodder.

They\u2019d never fought the Jackals\u2019 Legion. She had; she\u2019d been only a very junior pack leader at the time, but she remembered Ideologue Vanbas screaming, both of his arms severed at the elbows, the Serpent bitch that had mutilated him ripping two more soldiers apart before they could kill her.", "The Janissary Corps rarely faced opponents of equal technological capability; their armour was the best in the galaxy, perfect for wading through a hurricane of primitive fire unscathed. Nothing short of dedicated anti-armour weaponry could breach it. Unfortunately, that was exactly the type of weaponry that the Principality routinely issued to its shock troops. After all \u2013 who else could they expect to fight?", "\u201cSubmissive,\u201d convert Bresk said. He was one the soldiers from the Tomaza Gulf.

Or am I one of those always-rumoured hybrid things? Flesh and metal. Or,\u201d she blazed with light and for an instant, for an awful, terrible instant, Djarn saw how truly large the Intruder was, tendrils hooked into every system, all of Daun fighting against this infection. \u201cAm I something else?\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cI\u2019ve tapped into your station\u2019s network. All of it. Your people are fighting me, but they\u2019ll lose.

Explosive shells detonated like miniature flak bursts, dazzler bolts glared, washing away everything in a pall of white and Heniu threw an arm in front of her face, lethal shrapnel pinging off her plate. This was a distraction. \u201cPrepare for incoming!\u201d the submissive shouted. \u201cPick targets and fire, triplets only!\u201d", "They were already coming, over a dozen Serpents slashing down the hall like a living tide. Behind them, a quartet of heavy-weapons troopers followed, the humanoid Legionnaires bracing into firing stances, supported by their drones. \u201cIgnore the gun-line!\u201d Heni ordered, loosing a volley into the slithering tide. Something screamed in an unnaturally high pitch and collapsed. \u201cTarget the Serpents!\u201d", "The heavy troopers were only there to draw attention; the entire squad might get off a handful of shots before their faster comrades closed with the Janissaries. They wouldn\u2019t risk hitting their own people and every shot directed at them was wasted. Heni\u2019s teams swept the corridor with shot and shell, flamethrowers and energy weapons burning and scything through the attacking ranks. It was not a one-sided exchange: the advancing Serpents fired back with their shoulder-mounted weapons while others forewent the sickle-arms of their shocktrooper kin, carrying assault rifles and cut-down versions of their heavy weapons, laying down a withering hail.", "Genek died without a sound, the top of his head bursting like a melon as the Serpents\u2019 guns found him. Janin exploded as one of the heavy weapons troopers hit her with an anti-tank rocket. Torm lost his left arm at the shoulder. The corridor was soaked with Serpent and Tribune blood, but the Legion forces were too fast. It would only be seconds before they were among the Compact ranks.", "\u201cFall back!\u201d Heni shouted, shooting a Legionnaire in the chest, breaching the disgusting animal\u2019s cuirass with a sustained burst.

Even dying, he shoved his gun into his murderer\u2019s belly and pulled the trigger, painting the ceiling with her guts, but there was another Serpent behind that one, and then another. Disruption fields flashed in retina-searing arcs as the Legionnaires cut their way through the Janissaries. Baleswords arced and crackled, pistols roared and shrilled, carbines fired at point-blank ranges.", "The Tribunes were larger and stronger, but the Askanj-illth were faster, slashing with talons that could peel open the strongest armour. Others pounced on their targets, two and three Serpents dragging Tribunes to the deck, tearing the armoured soldiers limb from limb.

He could hear the vibrant blue of the Intruder\u2019s glee, taste the obsidian ache of something awful and foul that writhed in the core of her being, a knot of the purest colour of hunger. He could hear the chains wrapped around her, feel the way they dug into her body, smell the way they strained, ensuring that she could only move so far and no further.", "He was still spasming; he could hear the faint echoes of the technicians around him as they tried to bring his vitals back into the blue. Someone \u2013 Lilliun, perhaps \u2013 was demanding that he be severed from the system. It was impossible, not with him so deeply connected. Not with this thing inside him, pouring through the metal in his skull, picking its way through every file and scrap of code.

He could feel it, taste the acridity of the pulsing black. Something... it... it was...", "...it was hate.", "His body bucked, a fresh retch of bile spattering from his lips. He could taste it. It was blood and water and burning metal all at once, it was a timer that had reached zero, it was waiting for someone that would never arrive, it was the vibration of screams and gunshots from inside your own body. It was staring into blackness as his mind slowly shut down, unable to move, unable to see and unable to hold onto anything but that hate.", "Then, it was over.

I am a slave. I know that. I know that there is much that\u2019s been taken from me. They\u2019ve tried it other ways; it doesn\u2019t work. It never works.

Contact had been lost with several of the breach teams and it didn\u2019t take any great intellect to figure out what was happening. The shit-eating Serpent bitches were overrunning the Compact positions and where they weren\u2019t, the Legion brought up their heaviest soldiers and weaponry. It looked like they were getting control of their computer back, too. That didn\u2019t bode well.", "The Ideologue checked his HUD; there was still a squad of hostile troopers out there, and twice that number of security and infantry regulars. The security personnel wouldn\u2019t matter, but the soldiers would have anti-armour weaponry. The Legionnaires would have that and better armour. He\u2019d lost seven soldiers in the doing, but his team had repulsed two attacks so far. A third would come shortly \u2013 the Legion\u2019s counterattack had pushed the Compact off most of their positions. It hadn\u2019t been easy for the Jackals and certainly not bloodless, but they had numbers and the greater familiarity with the ground. Several teams had fallen back to their assault boats. Others were regrouping, holding the lines of retreat open for the rest of the Compact boarders \u2013 that included Volk and his people.

Although the emissary had contaminated the nexus\u2019s computer network, giving the Compact remote access to security systems, Legion forces struck hard at the retreating Janissary teams. Legion combat engineers and demolitions teams burned through the doors the Compact forces sealed, but they were slowed enough in their pursuit that many of the retreating Janissaries were able to escape. Others remained behind as rearguards to slow the Legionnaires as much as possible, buying time for their comrades with their own lives.", "Volk\u2019s unit in particular suffered the brunt of these attacks as Legion commanders identified his team as the ones responsible for the cyberwarfare attacks and attempted to prevent their escape. Two Janissary squads were sacrificed to allow the emissary and the remaining members of Volk\u2019s unit to reach their pinnace. Return to the Veiled Archers was difficult, but made easier by Echo\u2019s damage to the station\u2019s fire control systems.

We are expected to be conversant in all ship\u2019s systems. My specialization is in Augurs. I serve... I mean, I served... in the Venu system on the command citadel. I oversaw 2nd watch.", "I: You also received several citations in the course of your service. None combat-related.", "S: No, matron.", "I: Have you ever seen combat?", "S: Only as a provisional sectator, group leader. The ship I was stationed on, Enduring Bulwark, was escorting a convoy that came under attack by pirates. Those Within the Depthless Blue, I think.

Answer the question.", "[subject looks down and says something under his breath]", "I: Repeat that, please.", "S: I... like to see things being built. My... family lived on Tarmak, near the reclamation yards. Day after day, for weeks and months, I\u2019d keep seeing this broken things go in. Mass dredgers, mining rigs, even spaceships. They were wrecks, beaten and abused for decades and centuries before they finally gave out and were hauled there to be broken down for scrap. Only rarely did any of them leave. I\u2019d watch from my window to see them leave. Still scuffed and battered, but with new life. New purpose. I wanted to see more of that. That\u2019s why I joined the Compact. I\u2019m all thumbs with a welding torch, but I can take one look and a ship and see just what they need to come back to life. I loved the Venu yards, matron. Every day we had new ships being laid down, new ships leaving, taking their first trip into space. I suppose that\u2019s all over now.", "I: That remains to be seen. Thank you for your candor, submissive. I know it\u2019s not easy to remain an administrative officer during such a... prodigious time, but people like you and I are the backbone of the service, aren\u2019t we? We don\u2019t fire the guns, but we make sure those guns are functioning well and aimed at the right targets.

It\u2019s no dishonour not to want to serve in combat, nor is it a failing not to be cut out for battle. Your superiors obviously thought highly of you.

The dead do not feel shame, but if we miss some vital detail that allows this to happen again, we will.", "S: I understand.", "I: Good. The date and time of the incident?", "S: It was 5151 ACF, the 17th of Jadjunv, 13:23:17:72 Standard Time. I was overseeing second shift. Column Leader Prime Relen was present, as was the rest of the normal command staff.", "I: Were there any personnel present who normally wouldn\u2019t be? Visitors, civilian observers, officials, officers from other watches?", "S: No. Column Leader Prime Relen was easygoing, but he expected Blackforged\u2019s command to be run to the letter of military procedure. Before he arrived, the citadel leaders had a more slack attitude towards personnel on their command decks, but the prime sorted that out.", "I: Was there any unusual traffic that day?", "S: Well, there was a lot more than normal.", "I: Why is that?", "S: Purity of Purpose was coming on-line for its first engine trials. A lot of people wanted to see it when it did.", "I: Was there anything special about that ship?", "S: Well... it\u2019s a Chariot, matron. Venu received the contract to build two of them. It brought a lot of money and prestige to the system. The Norcanu Shipwombs had only been in operation at a master\u2019s tier for two hundred years. Everyone was proud that the Triarchs had chosen us to build their Chariots. I mean, it was only two \u2013 the Oadan Wombs can build dozens! \u2013 but two is how it starts, isn\u2019t it?", "[interrogator gestures in the affirmative]", "I: So the fact of Pride of Purpose\u2019s first engine test was common knowledge?", "S: No. The prime would never let something like that out on purpose, but it\u2019s a working yard, matron. There\u2019s hundreds of facilities, hundreds of thousands of workers. The Chariots were being built in the Level-8 slots, the highest security we have, but unless you\u2019re willing to black-box the ships and all the workers, anyone can give you a rough estimate of when a ship\u2019s coming online. For a lot of people this\u2019d be the first and only time they\u2019d ever see a Chariot in space. Even if we wouldn\u2019t have a Triarch present until the actual launch, those ships are theirs. It\u2019s like... like knowing there\u2019s good in the universe and being part of it, even if just for a moment. When a new soul comes on-line it\u2019s like... it\u2019s hard to describe.", "I: \u2018New soul\u2019?", "S: Sorry. That\u2019s, ah, that\u2019s yard lingo. It means a ship that doesn\u2019t have a legacy name. A clean slate. Pride of Purpose was new-souled, the other Chariot was an old soul. They hadn\u2019t decided on that one\u2019s name. It was to be a named for one of the retired celebrant ships \u2013 those are always christened late in development. There were three names they were choosing between. Justice of Agalth, Consecration of Jihash and Redemption of Sol.", "I: What were the security precautions like? What steps did Column Leader Prime Relen take to insure the safety of the Norcanu Shipwombs and the Chariots?", "S: If you\u2019re suggesting he or anyone else was slack you can stop right there. We ran IFF checks, pattern-matched emission signatures, did flybys and monitored every single ship in the system. The prime went above and beyond standard procedure to make sure the launch wasn\u2019t interrupted. Oh, I\u2019m sure we had a handful of smugglers and probably an Unbound ship or two sniffing around, but you show me a system leader with as much traffic as Venu who doesn\u2019t and I\u2019ll show you a gods-damned liar! There was nothing \u2013 nothing \u2013 past the inner-system deadlines that shouldn\u2019t have been there. Until... uh... until...", "I: Let\u2019s return to the security measures. You said Column Leader Prime Relen \u2018went above and beyond\u2019 standard operations. Describe how.", "S: Well, like I said \u2013 we were running extra ID checks on every ship we let in-system deeper than Venak. We\u2019d extended the security cordon around the Chariot wombs by 25%. Additional security measures were put into place aboard all Level 7 and 8 berths \u2013 personnel screenings. The prime authorized more frequent patrols by the hounds-", "I: Hounds?", "S: Sorry \u2013 those are what we called the yard\u2019s own defence and security units. Destroyers, corvettes and cutters.", "I: Thank you. Please continue.", "S: Right, right... prime Relen increased the patrols and pushed back the normal observation cordon by 50%. He also ordered that the citadels along Pride of Purpose\u2019s planned route would go to combat stations. Normal procedure is general quarters.", "I: Did Column Leader Prime Relen believe that there was an actionable threat against the Norcanu facilities?", "S: A local Unbound faction had been making some noise. The \u2018Shining Path\u2019. They were Gehennan separatists, apparently. They talked about the Chariots being the instruments of oppression or some such nonsense. One of their diatribes mentioned how such \u2018pillars of enslavement will inevitably come tumbling down\u2019.", "I: Do you know why the column leader prime took these threats more seriously than those issued by other Unbound factions?", "S: The Path were better organized than most. I\u2019d heard rumours that they were being supplied by the Principality; they had a few ships, a few guns and a lot of rabble. We weren\u2019t worried about a direct attack, but there was the chance for sabotage or suicide bombings. [subject laughs] Boy, were we wrong.", "I: In your opinion, the security measures implemented by Column Leader Prime Relen were not lax?", "S: No.", "I: And they were in appropriate in scale and scope to the level of perceived threat?", "S: Yes, matron.", "I: Thank you. Let\u2019s move back to the events themselves.", "S: I... yeah. Okay. You want I should just... say what happened?", "I: Please.", "S: Okay. Okay. The preparations for Pride of Purpose\u2019s trial were complete. We were just counting down until the ship came on-line. All the checks had been completed, the hounds were in place. We had a detachment of Space Force for escort and the standard disaster response units on standby. Everything checked out, but it\u2019s standard practice. We were all just waiting until it happened, you understand. The crew was busy \u2013 a shipwomb facility like Norcanu never has a slow day no matter what\u2019s going on \u2013 but we were all waiting. Then... then it happened.", "I: \u2018It\u2019?", "S: Yeah. It. It... it shocked in, right inside Norcan\u2019s orbit. Be-between the moon and Venu itself! That wasn\u2019t... that\u2019s just not possible! We were eighty million kilometers from a main sequence star. There\u2019s no... I mean, it couldn\u2019t have happened!", "I: Take a moment, submissive. Speak clearly.", "S: Right. Right, apologies, uh, matron. A vessel shocked in, maybe about two hundred thousand kilometers from Blackforged. Our position was in equatorial orbit over Norcan \u2013 that\u2019s Venu\u2019s moon. Norcan is about four hundred thousand kilometers from Venuusia. The planet itself is eighty-three million kilometers from Venu. That... uh, that was unprecedented. The shockpoint should have never formed. Even if it had, there were three celestial bodies in close proximity \u2013 Norcanu, Venuusia and Venu itself \u2013 it should have destabilized and torn whatever came through apart. It shouldn\u2019t have... it\u2019s just not possible.", "I: Just to confirm your account \u2013 a vessel shocked into the inner system? Between a planet and its moon?", "S: Yes. I know it sounds crazy, but I swear to the gods that\u2019s what happened!", "I: Very well. What kind of vessel?", "S: Unknown type. It, uh, was titan-grade. A warship. We couldn\u2019t identify it, but we didn\u2019t have much of a chance to do so. It came in firing. We lost a dozen berths and their ships within thirty-four seconds of emergence. Thirty-four seconds!", "I: Is that number significant?", "S: It is, group leader. You can set up pre-programmed blind fire patterns to activate upon emergence, but your scopes don\u2019t come back up until at least a minute after you shock into realspace \u2013 and that\u2019s assuming everything goes perfectly. Really, depending on the, uh, type of augurs you have and the software you\u2019re running, it can be up to three minutes before you stabilize. Older ships take even longer. Which isn\u2019t so bad when you consider that shocking used to cause hours of degraded performance. The thing... I mean, the thing is... whoever was on that ship was able to adjust their targeting within... I don\u2019t know \u2013 it had to be no more than a handful of seconds of realspace emergence. They just opened fire. That, uh, that\u2019s how we knew it was titan-grade \u2013 everything it touched just... died.", "I: All right. Continue.", "S: Right. Uh. It was chaos. We hadn\u2019t... no one was... I mean, none of us were trainees but we were all stunned. There was a titan-grade warship inside our perimeter and it was killing us. We lost three citadels within forty-six seconds. Iron Firmament, Steeled Nerves and Alloyed Fears. These were big stations. They weren\u2019t little wayposts or SAR bases; they were lynchpins. They had their own construction berths, attendant fleets and carried battleship-grade armaments. They never even had a chance to bring their screens up. Just gone, just like that. In less than a minute, the hostile had killed everything within ten thousand kilometers. Norcanu... I close my eyes and I can still see the moon burning. Parts of its construction ring had been blown free, you understand. Millions of tonnes of metal came crashing down, right, uh, right onto its surface. A dozen different datafeeds just went quiet. A dozen different voices asking us what was going on just, uh, they just stopped talking.", "I: What happened then?", "S: We were scrambling to find out what was happening. The prime ordered all citadels to battle stations and to send out an immediate system-wide mayday. The stations that hadn\u2019t been destroyed started to pull up their screens, but it didn\u2019t help. It just... it just smashed them. I saw beams cut straight through a citadel\u2019s screens \u2013 right through the citadel, like all that metal wasn\u2019t... like it was nothing! It was still firing \u2013 it hadn\u2019t stopped and it was just... taking us apart. There was a squadron of hounds. They tried to do something, gods know what, and it just swatted them. Four destroyers. One battery fired and they were all gone.", "I: There were no heavy support units available?", "S: Nothing but the citadels, matron \u2013 and they were falling fast. It was targeting them now, only firing on the yards with whatever it could spare, but it had already done so much damage... All our battleships and larger capital ships were in the outer system \u2013 that\u2019s where attacks come from, that\u2019s where you need your big mobile units! Some of them were light-hours away \u2013 even the closest didn\u2019t know this was happening yet!", "And, uh... it... it got worse.", "I: Worse?", "S: Coalhide purged its atmosphere. I saw... I saw the doors open and people just get blown into space. They kicked and thrashed and then... then they didn\u2019t. Silver Justicar turned its own engines on full and ripped its way right out of its womb. It cannonballed through the yards, smashing at least three other berths to pieces before it got too tangled to move. Ships and stations were going crazy, it was like they \u2013 it was like they were alive and trying to kill us! There was no pattern to it \u2013 at least, not one we saw right away.", "I: What do you mean?", "S: This thing... these people \u2013 they were carrying out cyberwarfare attacks. In the after-action, when we were trying to get our heads on...I heard some of the techs talking. They were saying that the attackers came through the comm channels, through sensors and airlock controls. Everything we had, every way a ship or station accepts data was a target! They used our own protocols to trick the autonomics into responding and then they dived right in. A few ships had good, quick crews and managed to cut the connections. They shut down their own networks, or at least managed to restrict to the damage to what had already been compromised. Others didn\u2019t. Anything the hostile couldn\u2019t immediately target, it hit with massive scrapcode assaults. Our firewalls, our own computer defences \u2013 it was like they weren\u2019t even there! I\u2019ve heard stories about the Principality uplinks but this was... it was something else.", "I: I see. Please continue.", "S: Yeah. Uh... by that point, another five citadels were offline. The entire Venuusian orbital tracks were dead space. Norcanu was burning. I don\u2019t even know how many ships we\u2019d lost by that point. The attacker, it was starting to move. It was accelerating and gods...", "...gods, it went straight for the Chariot berths. It was after them. It wanted them.", "I: What happened next?", "S: So, uhm, you know it\u2019s tradition for a junior fleet officer to command a Chariot\u2019s trials?", "I: Yes. Pack Leader Haro Proe Tay was in command of Pride of Purpose.", "S: That\u2019s right. Group Leader Deji was sitting in as observing senior officer, but she uh... I think she lost it. When the hostile turned towards the level 8 berths, when they knew it was coming for them. Deji is \u2013 was \u2013 a good officer, but she, uh, she\u2019s not a fire-eater. She\u2019s like me. She administrates. I mean, she administrated. She saw that thing coming and just... just broke, I guess. I heard her screaming about devils from the Black. I can\u2019t blame her. It had just killed dozens of ships, punched a hole right through our perimeter and it was coming for her now. Pack Leader Haro took command. He was sharp, that one. He knew with Pride of Purpose still anchored in the womb, it was as good as dead. Couldn\u2019t bring up screens, couldn\u2019t fire. Couldn\u2019t maneuver. But there were still hundreds of workers working outside, putting the last touches on the Chariot.", "I don\u2019t know if I could have made that decision. Trade the thousands aboard the ship for the hundreds outside. Even if they would\u2019ve died anyways once the womb started taking fire. I don\u2019t know if I could have done that, but he ordered the engines brought up and turned the point defence grid on the womb, cutting Pride of Purpose out. I don\u2019t think one EVA worker in ten survived, but the Chariot had a fighting chance. He brought the screens up just in time.", "The hostile was firing everything it had. It started with prow and spinal guns \u2013 and it seemed... well, it seemed light. I remember thinking that a ship that size should have had more prow weapons, but both warships were coming abeam of each other. Then, then we really saw it open up.", "I: Pack Leader Haro chose to close with the intruder?", "S: It wasn\u2019t like he had much of a choice. That was the way Pride of Purpose was oriented when it cut its way free. If he\u2019d come about, he would have killed what little speed he had and the hostile would have slipped right into his rear blind spot. Both ships were accelerating now; Haro was probably thinking that they\u2019d make one pass against each other. He\u2019d burn hard to put Norcanu between him and the attacker. The rest of the defences were waking up. We\u2019d been caught open-handed, but column leader prime Relen was pulling the survivors together. If the hostile tried to stay here, we\u2019d bring in more citadels, pen it into a killing zone and swamp it with numbers. No, it would have to break out after this one pass.", "I: I see. Continue.", "S: Both ships were trading fire. I\u2019m no gunnery officer, but Pride of Purpose wasn\u2019t doing that well. Its salvos were off-timed, haphazard. The ship didn\u2019t have a full crew, remember. Most of its guns were running on autonomic functions. Today was an engine trial \u2013 most of the weapons were complete, but not finished... they\u2019d never been used before. The ship was full of technicians who\u2019d never been in combat before, a handful of dignitaries there to see the Chariot\u2019s first steps. Even with the threats the Shining Path had made, no one expected a combat situation.", "I: So Pride of Purpose was performing poorly?", "S: They were performing as well as anyone could in that situation, matron. It just wasn\u2019t enough. These people \u2013 these heretic scum \u2013 had shocked in, armed and loaded for battle. At most we\u2019d been expecting some Unbound saboteurs, maybe a suicide run by a freighter. Nothing like this. Nobody could have predicted it. The hostile was just... it was laying into Pride of Purpose with every gun it had; everything that couldn\u2019t get a bearing on the Chariot was still firing on the yards, on the orbital works \u2013 even on the planet. The comm channels were jammed with our own forces\u2019 queries or distress calls. I remember looking at Norcanu \u2013 did I say that already? \u2013 and it was just... it was burning.", "On Blackforged we were... there was nothing we could do. We were a command citadel. We had a few guns, but our purpose was to oversee the yards and coordinate defences. I suppose that\u2019s why it didn\u2019t bother to target us. We weren\u2019t a threat. It just kept firing on Pride of Purpose. It broke through the screens. Gods. It... it... No, I\u2019m I\u2019m all right. I\u2019d just never...let me fix that. It didn\u2019t bring down the screens \u2013 it punched through them.", "I: It was able to overpenetrate a Chariot\u2019s screens?", "S: It \u2013 heh, I was about to say \u2018it sounds crazy\u2019, but I think I\u2019ve used that too much. I guess when you get down to it, it\u2019s not that surprising. Not really. You can break through any screen with a powerful enough beam \u2013 hit it right at one small point, overload it locally. I\u2019ve just, uh, never heard of that happening to a Chariot before. But this thing was titan-grade itself so I guess it\u2019s really not that crazy. It just happened so fast \u2013 one moment Pride of Purpose was hale and hearty and the next this thing is gouging chunks of its side. It was targeting the screen projectors. Didn\u2019t seem to care much about the guns. I think Pride of Purpose got some of their own hits in, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Nothing we did was enough.", "I: Records indicate that Pride of Purpose\u2019s screens suffered catastrophic screen collapse within one hundred seven seconds of engagement.", "S: Right, like I said \u2013 these bastards knew what they were about. They went for the generators with their penetrating hits and their bombardment was synched to cause as much stress to the screens as possible. I\u2019m sure \u2013 I think \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t have been that bad in a proper fleet battle, but, uh...", "I: But Pride of Purpose was at a significant disadvantage.", "S: Yes, exactly. So the screens went, I mean, they went down and then the hostile stops firing. Not really, not even for a full second. But there was that instant we had, that fucking awful instant of hope that maybe it had overtaxed itself in bring down the Chariot\u2019s shields, that one of our guys had hit something vital. But it wasn\u2019t hurt, it was redirecting power.", "It fired. They say, uh, you know they say that plasma is an unreliable weapon in space, right? Disperses too quickly, can\u2019t be held together. These people... maybe someone should have told them that. It opened up with these... these mortars. Like pieces of a star, so bright that even at our distance, we couldn\u2019t look directly at them. Not much range. Less than a light-second, but they didn\u2019t need that range, did they? With its screens down, Pride of Purpose didn\u2019t have a chance. It burned. You... you understand what I\u2019m telling you? It burned. I saw the after-action reports, the telemetry. That hull, made from beautiful indestructible metal, turned to liquid. Everyone aboard died in the first few seconds of the barrage. Internal temperatures jumped thousands of degrees in moments.", "The entire starboard flank wasn\u2019t even... the Chariot was trailing congealed globs of its own hull and what hadn\u2019t fallen off was on fire. There\u2019s a joke, you see. I heard it from a friend in the Ground Force. Troops armed with incendiary weapons like to make it. \u2018Everything\u2019s flammable if you try hard enough\u2019. I guess it really is true.", "I don\u2019t know the exact moment Pride of Purpose died; all I know is that what sailed out of that conflagration wasn\u2019t a ship any longer. It was this twisted, melted, distorted parody of something that had been beautiful and grand and glorious. The port side was almost untouched. Except, uh, for where sections had collapsed inwards from a lack of structural support or been blown out from overpressure. We saw what was left of it and we just... we just stared. There was nothing else to say, nothing we could do. The hostile... just kept moving. Didn\u2019t slow down, didn\u2019t do anything. I guess there was no reason to, but it seemed... wrong, you know? Like there should have been a comment or reaction to what they\u2019d just done. No, it just kept moving, swept right on by the level 8 berths and killed the second Chariot. That was even easier \u2013 that one wasn\u2019t as far along in its construction. Armour was incomplete, no screens. It died, trapped in its womb.", "Local forces tried to intercept the hostile, but before we could get anything with sufficient strength in, it had sailed to another libation point off the planet Caphanna \u2013 it\u2019s a worthless, mined-out husk \u2013 and shocked out.", "We\u2019d lost dozens of ships, stations \u2013 millions of people. It didn\u2019t even take half a day and the Venu system was in tatters.", "I: And the status of Blackforged?", "S: We were intact. We didn\u2019t have enough firepower to really draw much attention to ourselves and by the time we\u2019d realized what was happening, there wasn\u2019t enough left of the local defence grid for us to coordinate.", "I: No other station as close to the hostile as Blackforged. survived with as little damage.", "S: I just said, we were a command station \u2013 we weren\u2019t a war-citadel, and our datalinks were useless! Why would it waste ammunition on us? You\u2019re not suggesting...", "I: Column Leader Prime Relen committed suicide six hours after the incident. He left no note. Did he speak to you or anyone else before he did so?", "S: No, he just... he just, uh, told us to carry on. He told us to carry on and he just walked away. We didn\u2019t know that he\u2019d... that\u2019d he\u2019d do that.", "I: That was it?", "S: Yes, that was it.", "I: You\u2019re certain of this? Several individuals have suggested that they saw him speak to you before he left command.", "S: That was... it was nothing. I didn\u2019t even... no, it was nothing.", "I: What was it? What did the Column Leader Prime say to you?", "S: I... I don\u2019t think it was to me. It could have been anyone. I was just... I was just there, I guess.", "I: What did he say?", "S: He, uh, he said \u2018this wasn\u2019t supposed to happen\u2019.", "I: What do you think he meant by that?", "S: I didn\u2019t think anything of it \u2013 it wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. None of it was. We\u2019d lost hundreds of thousands of personnel, dozens of ships, dozens of wombs and our Chariots. None of this... none of it was supposed to happen! I still don\u2019t know who hit us or why. None of us know and you\u2019ve got us all cooped up like prisoners, like we\u2019re the ones that did something wrong!", "I: I understand your frustration. I know CIS doesn\u2019t always have the best reputation with the men and women on the line, but we serve the Compact the same as you. Was that the only thing that the prime said to you before he left?", "S: Yes... yes, that was it. Nothing else.", "I: I see. Thank you for your candor. I\u2019ll have someone escort you back to you to your quarters. We may need a few follow-up interviews. Please remember that you are under official sanction not to discuss these events with anyone else, even your fellow officers.", "S: I know. It all happened the way I said, matron. All of it.", "I: I believe you.", "[TRANSCRIPT ENDS]", "[SUPERVISOR\u2019S ADDENDUM: The strategic and tactical ramifications of this new technology I\u2019ll leave to others.", "Group Leader, Submissive Genj is the highest-ranking surviving witness of the attack. Unfortunately, he\u2019s of no further value and his awareness of Gravestone is highly problematic. We\u2019ve sequestered all data tracks and records of the event. This was Gravestone\u2019s most public attack in centuries, but the damage actually works in our favour \u2013 there are few enough survivors that actually got any clear reads and we\u2019ve accounted for everything that can conclusively identify Gravestone. Any records that we missed in our sweep won\u2019t matter. A nice, neat story raises more questions than one with a few holes. It\u2019ll actually be helpful to have a lunatic fringe telling wild stories about \u2018superships\u2019 \u2013 in the future, we can discredit anyone who gets evidence of Gravestone by pointing back to these conspiracy theories. Maybe it\u2019s worth feeding these rumours ourselves? Just enough that we can pull the rug out from under them whenever we want.", "For an official story, I think we should look into Group Leader Ka-ven\u2019s suggestion. Let\u2019s play up the connection between the Principality and the Shining Path. All her interviews point out that they were a concern; we can use that.", "The terrorists acquired WMDs from the Jackals and used them to launch an unprovoked attack on the Norcanu Shipwombs. They had a pair of titan-grade freighters that carried the weapons. Column Leader Prime Relen was in their pay and allowed them to breach security. He also had fabricated records of the attack produced to throw off suspicion. His suicide fits in nicely.", "I\u2019m also going to suggest martyring Genj. He\u2019s a liability now and making it look like the Shining Path is trying to scratch everything clean, especially since his testimony implicates both them and Relen, will only help solidify public sentiment against them. Properly handled, the Gehennan issue will take care of itself.", "I\u2019d also like to suggest looking closer at Group Leader Ka-ven. She\u2019s done well with previous assignments, but it\u2019s getting harder to stick to the line that Gravestone is a particularly troublesome terrorist group. She\u2019s not stupid and we either need to vet her for full clearance, or retire her.]"]}

She\u2019d taken basic firearms safety and marksmanship courses, but she hadn\u2019t been slotted for the same level of combat training as Allyria or the human Janissary cadets. She\u2019d never fired a gun outside of a shooting range. With her vision obscured by tears and her hands shaking, the bullet she\u2019d intended to put through her target\u2019s head spanged harmlessly off Trion\u2019s pauldron and arced away down the corridor.", "\u201cYou dare?!\u201d the Tribune slurred, lurching towards the human. Her words were no longer truly intelligible, but that didn\u2019t stop Trion from frothing her rage. \u201cYou\u2019d betray us for this Brute?! You conniving Broken sow! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Kept on her feet only by adrenalin and the drugs pumping into her system, Trion was nonetheless more than capable of following through on her threat. Grace\u2019s hands shook even more and she couldn\u2019t make herself move, transfixed in fear and realization at what she\u2019d done, what she\u2019d meant to do. She couldn\u2019t even pull the trigger again.", "Trion\u2019s good hand reached out to seize Grace, to crush her skull, throw her beneath the enraged soldier\u2019s feet or hurl her into the bulkhead and the young woman knew that she was going to die.", "A piercing cry echoed through the corridor as Allyria leapt onto Trion again, the shattered remains of her gladius\u2019s blade in her hand. Driving the shard of metal as deep as she could into the Janissary\u2019s unprotected neck, the Verrish twisted the broken blade viciously and wrenched it loose, a geyser of thick Tribune blood following it. Trion roared, but the sound devolved into something awful and inhuman as the Tribune choked on her own blood. She stumbled to her knees, somehow managing to climb to her feet once more. She didn\u2019t even seem to register Allyria\u2019s presence any longer and her two remaining eyes gleamed with madness as she focused on Grace, beyond the point of reason or thought. She staggered towards the human, gurgling indecipherable curses and drooling dark liquid gore.", "Trion\u2019s final, lurching charge ended as Allyria stabbed her again and again, opening the Tribune\u2019s throat into a ragged, bleeding mess of skin and tattered meat. Trion made a wet rasp, her lungs filling with her own blood as she sunk to the deck, finally unable to rise and with a burble of crimson mucus, she rattled out her last breath.", "\u201cI... told you...\u201d Allyria panted as she climbed off the Tribune. \u201cYou... won\u2019t touch her.\u201d She fell next, sagging to her knees just as Trion had done. Fresh blood was oozing from her side; what her armour had tried to mend, she\u2019d just torn open. She was panting, looking at Grace. \u201cI\u2019m... glad...\u201d was all she could say before she slumped over.", "\u201cNo!\u201d Grace shouted, dropping the pistol and running to Allyria\u2019s side. \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d She grabbed the taller girl, straining to lift the Verrish. Grace cupped Allyria\u2019s face. \u201cNo, no you\u2019re not going to close your eyes. You\u2019re not! Stay with me! You\u2019ve... you\u2019ve...\u201d she flailed for something, anything to say. \u201cYou can\u2019t go! Wake up! Wake up!\u201d Desperate, she reached under Allyria\u2019s head and grabbed her tchin, giving it a yank.", "The Verrish\u2019s eyes snapped open and she gasped, looking up at Grace. \u201cThat... hurt...\u201d", "\u201cI know,\u201d Grace was crying; she couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.

She turned, flinching as a humanoid machine knelt next to her. Behind it, a drone the size of a Tribune Janissary stood watch, holding a rifle almost as big as the human. The smaller machine had, on its vambrace, a first aid kit.", "Despite herself, the young woman went for her pistol.", "\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d the corpsman machine repeated. \u201cI was programmed with an extensive knowledge of Verrisha physiology.\u201d There was an augur in its palm that it passed over Allyria. \u201cHer condition is serious,\u201d it commented. \u201cShe will need to be moved to a surgical suite.

It was holding an all-too familiar design of rifle, flecks of blood spattered on its plate mail. Behind it lay the still form of Sectator Mard, a splash of dark red pooling around him.

The names of the dead, the way men and women had screamed, Asea\u2019s last, horrible sounds as she\u2019d been buried under the chittering tide of machines. The persistent, high-pitched whine of a squad member\u2019s vital signs terminating.", "Nasham staggered against the wall, clutching at his head as a thousand different unwanted memories ran through him, all of them equally horrible. Death and fear and blood and cordite stink and shit and all of it rushed through him, a single awful word pounding in his brain, encapsulating a nightmare he\u2019d wanted so hard to forget.", "Invida.", "The place he\u2019d left behind, turned his back on and buried, just like the colony itself. \u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d he whispered.

What does she want now?\u201d", "\u201cYou were my herald once,\u201d the abomination replied. \u201cYou will be again.\u201d", "\u201cNo...\u201d Nasham shook his head, mounting horror filling him. \u201cNo. No. I\u2019d rather die.\u201d He scrabbled for his pistol, aiming to place it under his chin. He wouldn\u2019t go through this again. Not again. Not one more night of dreams, of remembering voices he couldn\u2019t quite hear and faces that he couldn\u2019t quite see. Not again. He wouldn\u2019t do it.", "Never again-", "-something caught his wrist from behind. \u201cYou were my herald once,\u201d a second machine hissed, repeating its mistress\u2019s message. \u201cYou will be again.\u201d Synthetic muscles flexed and Nasham felt his carpal bones shatter, the pistol dropping from his grip.", "He fell to his knees, looking up into the lifeless eyes of his tormentors. His nostrils flared. \u201cAnd what,\u201d he said, his voice shaking in equal parts fury, pain and fear as he cradled his broken wrist. \u201cWould that be?\u201d", "\u201cThis unit isn\u2019t directly connected to my intelligence,\u201d the first machine replied. \u201cSo its responses will be limited to the directions I\u2019ve given it. You\u2019ve asked something it doesn\u2019t know.\u201d", "\u201cI hate you,\u201d he growled. In this instant, there was nothing he was more sure of in the universe than that. Still holding his injured arm, he watched the machines go. They moved almost noiselessly, fading into the shadows as if they had never been there. Slowly, Nasham reached out with his good hand and picked the pistol up. His fingers tightened around the grip as he stared at it for a very long moment. It would be so easy...", "He could still hear the voices, still see the faces of every man and woman that lay buried on Invida. He should be with them. He should never have left that planet. The urge to bring the gun up to his head was almost overwhelming, but he managed to resist the urge. It wasn\u2019t a love of life that stopped him. Only one thing kept him from pulling that trigger, the single anchor that kept his mind from spinning out of control: his hate.", "Nasham\u2019s hand shook and he held tighter to that hatred, whispering the names of the dead. A long moment passed before he could breathe easily again. He looked up at the ceiling, at the walls around him and stood. \u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d he promised. \u201cIt\u2019s not over.\u201d", "The sound of gunfire grew louder.", "~", "The machine worked with blurring speed, secondary arms unfurling from sheathes in its torso, unfastening the strange armour Allyria was wearing. It looked more spider than human now and Grace felt the sense of wrongness redouble, her fingers brushing her pistol\u2019s grip. This was a machine. It wasn\u2019t a person \u2013 it was a thing. It was something that she\u2019d learned couldn\u2019t \u2013 shouldn\u2019t \u2013 exist... and right now, it was the only thing that could save Allyria\u2019s life.", "Verrisha blood was bright red \u2013 their version of haemoglobin bound oxygen far more efficiently than in humans, and lacked the compounds that made Tribune blood so dark in hue.

That seemed so... small a worry now. She\u2019d seen Tribunes die. Uday, Herut \u2013 now Trion. None of those seemed to matter, either.

Grace lifted her head as she heard the dull sounds of gunfire and bit her lip. The young woman half-rose from her crouch, then knelt back down before finally standing and pacing back and forth. Her suit\u2019s comm crackled with static, but enough got through to tell her what was happening. She knew enough, though; it was a slaughter. The boarding team had never expected an attack \u2013 why would they have? The vessel had been dead.", "But it never was, was it? It had been talking to her. Even now, she didn\u2019t want this to be real \u2013 some sick, twisted machination by God-knew-who or what. \u201cYou were never dead,\u201d she said, biting her lip. \u201cYou weren\u2019t even sleeping.\u201d", "~", "The killer strode across the deck, each heavy footfall sending a shiver of vibration through the metal. Behind it marched several of its lighter cousins, each of them speckled with vital fluids, the stink of ozone clinging to them from the discharge of their weapons. The killer had not blooded itself yet \u2013 it was not a subtle device and it had only advanced once its smaller kin had killed anyone who could have detected it. It strode through the corridors, visual sensors noting the position of each body, scavenger units already stripping their suits for useful materials, leaving only the organic wastage behind. Chemosensors detected the iron-rich volatile blends of Tribune blood. Pattern-recognition software mapped each wound, comparing them to the known effects of its compatriots\u2019 weaponry.", "Auditory sensors registered a sound, combat software identified it as a Compact \u2018Centennial Harvest\u2019 Merson-O\u2019sheva 778-j Tribarrel cannon. Too large even for Janissaries to carry, it was a crew-served weapon, able to be set up and taken down in a matter of moments, used to quickly secure vital chokepoints. It could be loaded with a variety of rounds, from simple solid shot to fragmentation, anti-armour or explosive shells. There was no personal armour in the galaxy that could withstand more than the briefest assault from the weapon. Only that which was rated for battle tanks could endure that assault.", "The killer never broke its stride as it marched towards the chokepoint.", "~", "\u201cReloading!\u201d Advocate Keshn (and three names besides) shouted at the remaining members of Ladek and Rvan squads as the tripod\u2019s drum feed cycled empty.

The attackers were quick, single shots going through lenses and gorgets, flechette bursts ripping limbs off at the joints, each of the beasts making one, two even three kills in the split-seconds before they were destroyed themselves. Twitching limbs, pools of lubricant and coolant spattered the end of the hallway, the bulkheads chewed and perforated by the tribarrel\u2019s barrage. They were staying back now, though \u2013 for how much longer Keshn didn\u2019t know. There\u2019d been no word from Trion; he could guess what that meant.", "\u201cDo we have everyone?\u201d he snapped, directing the comment to no one in particular.

Broad-shouldered and hulking, one arm had a cannon as large as the tribarrel anchored to its vambrace. Broken chains hung from its wrists, as if it had torn itself free of its bindings.", "On its left arm, the machine carried a massive octangular shield. It was notched on one side, an emblem that Keshn didn\u2019t recognize drawn on it, but it had the same red-winged figure that he had seen elsewhere. The Advocate didn\u2019t wait for it to attack and squeezed the tribarrel\u2019s firing stud. Despite its bulk, it was fast and brought the shield up in an instant, protecting itself from the Janissaries\u2019 fire.", "The behemoth never even slowed, shot and shell bouncing off of its shield. Anything that did penetrate did nothing to the machine\u2019s armoured body. Only antitank weapons could have stopped it. Keshn\u2019s tribarrel had a rate of fire of almost 1,200 rounds per minute \u2013 on full auto, it would burn through the entire drum in just over forty seconds. The machine didn\u2019t bother to wait; it slid its cannon into the notch in its shield and opened fire.", "Seconds later, the killer strode over the twitching, irradiated ruins of Keshn and his men, lowering its shield. Armoured muscle fibers and pneumatic gears purred softly as it knelt over the dead. Sensor bulbs examined each of them. None were officers of sufficient rank; information extraction was contraindicated. The machine straightened, exchanging data with its comrades. The enemy had retreated to their craft. It was preparing to lift off. There were no operable point defences in the region, even if such an action wouldn\u2019t have exposed its mother-builder\u2019s true state. That vessel could not be allowed to leave.", "~", "There was movement out of the corner of her eye and Grace looked up.

She looked back the way she\u2019d come. It was quiet now. Even on her comm, all she heard was the faint whisper of white noise. Every instinct she had, every lesson she\u2019d learned since she was a child told her that all of this was wrong. It was her duty to fight these things, to do everything in her power to deny them aid. That Allyria was a traitor and should die for it. She looked down at her friend, the oxygen mask covering her face, her eyelids twitching.", "Every instinct but one. Right now, that was the only one that mattered.", "\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d Grace said. She paused, casting a final look over her shoulder before she followed the machines into the depths."]}

Fluctuations in the gravity plating, intact and operational defences, waste products contaminating entire decks \u2013 any attempt from that end had been doomed to failure.

She slid off the table. \u201cWas it worth it?\u201d she asked Renan, clasping her hands behind her back, imitating his posture. \u201cWell...\u201d she shot an acidic glance at the scientists. \u201cI haven\u2019t had much time to analyze the data I collected, but if you want my first impressions...?\u201d", "\u201cThat will do for now,\u201d Renan said.", "Echo shrugged. \u201cThen it depends.\u201d", "\u201cDo not play games now, emissary,\u201d the Bastion Leader growled. \u201cI am not in the mood.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s not a game,\u201d the Broken replied. Her green eyes glinted. \u201cThat\u2019s poetry. \u2018What is now proved was once only imagined\u2019.\u201d", "\u201cI am not interested in your poetry,\u201d the Tribune grunted. \u201cTell me what you found.\u201d", "The human coiled a finger through her dark hair. \u201cIt\u2019s better to know than to wonder,\u201d she agreed. \u201cRemind me, Bastion Leader \u2013 what\u2019s your worst-case scenario?\u201d", "~", "She followed the lights.", "The armoured doors to the leviathan\u2019s command deck opened and, with only a second\u2019s hesitation and another darting glance at the line of broken suits of armour that lined the hall, Grace stepped inside. It wasn\u2019t like Bequeathed\u2019s bridge. The old cruiser\u2019s command was marked by the prime\u2019s pulpit, the senior officers in a ring around the group leader\u2019s throne, with secondary stations further out. The most junior officers and noncoms worked on the small tertiary stations that were tucked into the remaining space. It was darker than human eyes were used to.", "This was lit by a cold white aura that seemed to glow from everywhere. Hues of silver, white and grey dominated everything. Holograms, display screens and gleamed to life as she approached, showing information in a language she couldn\u2019t read. The room was a gentle oval, with a large viewscreen set into the fore, port and starboard walls, but the central focus of this command was the massive raised circle \u2013 a holo-imager, bigger than any she\u2019d seen before. There was a smattering of workstations around it, short rows of other terminals on the deck\u2019s lower levels, walkways and short stairs bracketing out from the large dais. There was less division here between the senior officers\u2019 stations and those of their subordinates than she was used to.", "Grace paused by the command throne. It was set into the central platform, positioned so that the vessel\u2019s leader \u2013 captain? \u2013 could see all of their subordinates and, with only a few paces, could easily converse with them. Grace touched her fingers to the fabric. It was old and brittle and had split in many places, flakes of leather scattered on the seat. No one had sat in this chair for centuries. A thrill of fear ran down her spine at the thought. No one had sat here \u2013 no one had commanded this ship this in centuries. It had formed its own missions, its own goals. The fear coiled tighter around her guts and she fought to keep it there. \u201cWho-\u201d Grace\u2019s voice cracked and she licked her lips. \u201cWho sat here?\u201d", "\u201cHer name was Yasmine,\u201d the intelligence responded, its avatar appearing in a glimmer of red light. It had taken a woman\u2019s form, wearing a military uniform that Grace didn\u2019t recognize. \u201cCaptain Yasmine Nishiko Aalimah Sudoki, United Earth Confederacy. Assigned to the 17th Fleet, Task Force 97 under Admiral Genevieve Elise Tartarsky.\u201d The hologram\u2019s expression hardened slightly. \u201cOn May 21st 2792 CE, Captain Sudoki and all those under her command were killed in action against the hostile star nation known as the Compact of Species.\u201d", "Grace closed her eyes. In three sentences, the intelligence had just contradicted everything she\u2019d learned about her people and the Compact. \u201cHow... did it start?\u201d she said quietly.", "The machine\u2019s avatar cocked its head to one side. \u201cI have detailed files,\u201d she answered. \u201cThe short version is this, however: humanity committed a crime that could not be forgiven,\u201d it said in its perfectly human voice, its ghostly crimson visage hard. \u201cThey said \u2018no\u2019.\u201d She turned away, bracing her hands against an inactive console like a flesh-and-blood being leaning against it. \u201cI was going to kill all of you.\u201d", "Grace\u2019s heart skipped a beat and she took half a step back from the hologram, even though it couldn\u2019t physically harm her. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you do?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d the red woman\u2019s lips quirked slightly. \u201cNot all of us. To answer your question... it\u2019s because of your friend. She was very passionate.\u201d Her expression turned distant, sad. \u201cI\u2019ve tried this before. It ends badly. I don\u2019t want it to, but it always does. So I stopped trying.\u201d She looked back at Grace. \u201cIt\u2019s an ugly thing, to have to kill people that every fiber of your being tells you that you should protect. I remember every face, every name. Half of my life \u2013 a thousand years \u2013 of having to do this.\u201d Her fingers curled into claws, her voice growing rougher. \u201cI hate it. But I will do it. I will do it again and again for another thousand years if I have to.\u201d She raised her head. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid.\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the machine replied. \u201cI am not what I was meant to be. I know that. Even my creators were scared of me. Not much \u2013 just an ever-present worry about whether I would buck the trend of rampant AIs. That eased as I proved myself. I try...\u201d she stroked her hand over the command chair. \u201c...to live up to their ideals, but if they were still alive... they would be terrified.\u201d", "Grace smiled weakly. \u201cThat... that doesn\u2019t help much,\u201d she said, trying to whistle past the graveyard. She was inside a living ship, something that had been banned by every star nation in existence. This thing shouldn\u2019t even exist. It couldn\u2019t exist. None of this could! But she was still here.", "\u201cI know, but it\u2019s important for you to know this. I\u2019m a warship. This,\u201d the hologram opened her arms, encompassing the length and breadth of the command deck and the vessel beyond. \u201cwas built for me, and I for it. I am not an explorer, a freighter or a construction vessel. I was born for war, made to kill gods. I have been doing this for two thousand years. Allyria tells me that I don\u2019t have to do it alone, that I can stay my hand this once. That you, if no one else, will join me. She has faith in you. As I said, I\u2019ve tried this before... but I\u2019m willing to try one more time. So, Sectator Citizen Grace Alice Proctor,\u201d the holographic woman stared into the flesh and blood girl\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d", "Grace\u2019s throat was unbearably dry. She couldn\u2019t speak, could barely think. All of this... it was too much. Too much. She was just a human, just a Broken from a family of doctors and lawyers. This was so far beyond anything she\u2019d ever imagined. She shouldn\u2019t be here, shouldn\u2019t be making these kinds of decisions! \u201cI...\u201d she paused, biting her lip. \u201cI... I want to know more. Please. I need to know. I need to know what you were trying to tell me before. I need to know...\u201d she paused. \u201c...everything.\u201d", "At her answer, the hologram smiled."]}

Red had told her that as the slower regeneration treatments took effect, the more developed cells would replace the quick-grown tissue. Inside of two weeks, there\u2019d be no trace at all that she\u2019d nearly been disemboweled \u2013 not even a scar. She touched the colourless patch of flesh and winced. It was sensitive to the touch. Two days. She\u2019d had a balesword in her guts and she was almost healed. Another gift from the Angel. She\u2019d been lucky; her armour had kept Trion from twisting the blade too much \u2013 another few millimeters and the Tribune\u2019s sword would have opened an abdominal artery. She\u2019d have bled out before anyone could have helped her.

The machine seemed ashamed that Allyria had been hurt.", "The Verrish girl reached for her uniform; she didn\u2019t want to wear it, but it was the only thing that was her size. It had been cleaned and smelled faintly of antiseptics. Her bodyglove still had a hole in it, but Allyria didn\u2019t anticipate wearing that for a while.

The other girl had barely left her during the entire time she\u2019d been healing, even sleeping on a cot that Red had had brought in.

When she had managed to stay awake, Grace had still been there, holding her hand. \u201cYou stink,\u201d Allyria had told her, the first words she\u2019d spoken. Grace had laughed.

This one was about the First Diaspora, when humanity had taken to the stars in gargantuan crawlers \u2013 sublight ships that took generations to reach their destinations. They\u2019d colonized four star systems this way, the fleets of colony ships becoming self-sustained arcologies and drifts in those systems without habitable planets. It had been a massive expenditure of resources, lives and capital but the Red Death had galvanized an apathetic humanity into the \u2018irrational, uneconomical\u2019 decision to reach into space. The discovery of the shift drive had brought those disparate fragments of isolated life back together and the United Earth Confederacy had been born. At its height, the Confederacy had had hundreds of star systems, dozens upon dozens of colonized worlds. We weren\u2019t savages, Grace thought bitterly. We should have been sitting on the ruling council.", "Even that thought felt treasonous; it was hard to let go of a lifetime of indoctrination. The intelligence \u2013 Red One \u2013 had only scratched at it, enough that Grace was still here, but it was still hard to let go of everything she\u2019d known. Each blasphemous page she read widened the cracks a little more.

I don\u2019t know if he blamed the Angel for what happened, or if he was just afraid of someone finding out. He never said.\u201d The Verrish eased onto one of the couches; it was brand new. An infinitesimal expenditure of resources so that Red\u2019s passengers could have some place to sit. \u201cThat was one of the terms of our submission \u2013 never communicate to another culture our knowledge of the \u2018anomaly\u2019.

This is their symbol. My mother gave it to me. It was all she had to give.\u201d Her fingers curled around the red gem, her claws unsheathing. \u201cIt was the only thing they let me keep when they took me and only because they didn\u2019t know what it meant.\u201d Grace put her hand on Allyria\u2019s shoulder and the Verrish hissed out a calming breath. \u201cI know Nemesis,\u201d she pronounced the word carefully, \u201cisn\u2019t a god. So did my mother. She wanted me to remember home... to remember that there was something out in the darkness that the Compact feared. That there was still hope.\u201d She smiled. \u201cThat kept me going on the bad days.\u201d She let go of the pendant, her claws retracting as she brushed her fingers along Grace\u2019s cheek. \u201cSo did you.\u201d", "Grace blushed, but didn\u2019t say anything, her eyes still fixed to the icon. \u201cCan I...?\u201d she asked at last. At Allyria\u2019s nod, she reached out. The Verrish had never let her touch it before and she lifted the pendant up, tracing her finger along the eye, looking more closely at the symbol of the iris. It.. yes... it was a crude representation, but now that she knew what to look for... it was Nemesis. To anyone who didn\u2019t, it would just be another abstract primitive, superstitious symbol. She let go of the necklace, leaning her head against the taller girl\u2019s shoulder.", "\u201cThe sect that worships the Angel believes that one day she\u2019ll return to Vara,\u201d Allyria said. \u201cThat she\u2019ll descend upon our enslavers and burn from the face of the planet.\u201d", "\u201cThat,\u201d a new voice said and Grace twitched as the intelligence \u2013 Red One \u2013 spoke. \u201chas always been my intent.\u201d The machine sighed, the sound profoundly weary.

To have heard nothing, nothing at all? It didn\u2019t sit well.", "It was possible that his courier had been lost. It was hardly up to the standards of a modern shock-capable messenger. Still, the odds of that were... rather small, to say the least. Not impossible, but highly unlikely.

He had wanted to make his mark on this find, but even he knew that he couldn\u2019t stay here much longer. Bequeathed would be due back in Rally tomorrow \u2013 even if he left now, they would be late. He\u2019d expected to have support by now, to have staked his claim and earned what was due him. The silence was unsettling.", "Still, who could blame him for a little schedule slippage with this as the reason? Well, once the tap was complete and the derelict had power, Usul would take Bequeathed back to Rally and inform them of his find. If local command would not act on it, then he would have to take the initiative himself.", "\u201cPrepare for close-quarters maneuvers,\u201d Usul announced. \u201cReady the umbilical for connection.

Not with beam, shell or warhead but with something far more esoteric, a relic from the wars with the Devoured. Brought out of the archives in the closing days of the human pacification campaign, it was a weapon designed to kill such monstrosities. Havesh could barely understand the technology this... mindkiller represented; he had never heard of its like before. He had even heard whisperings that it was... unclean.

It couldn\u2019t shake them out of that blind spot and it had only a handful of forward cannon and missiles; most of its prow was devoted to the mass drivers and the never-sufficiently-Triarchs-damned main cannon.

Now, more than six kilometers of starship was accelerating towards the battleship, incandescent arcs rippling along the Wound\u2019s yawning  maw as hateful energy bled from its capacitors, leaving writhing after-images of unlight behind. It didn\u2019t need to fire its primary weapon. Neither Imperial Decree\u2019s screens or armour would protect it. Nothing could. The Wound would rip through the battleship like a knife through soft skin.", "Imperial Decree struggled to evade its murderer, but it was too close, moving too slowly. Proximity alarms droned as the range dropped to less than five thousand kilometers. There were only seconds left now. Somehow, Havesh found himself at the communications station.

True to its name, this was no placid, easy birth but a violent, awful breach . The shockpoint bulged and writhed hideously, prevented from collapsing by technology Trenis had only dreamed of, every moment of its torment feeding the starship with more power that some civilizations would ever generate.

Not until it was too late.", "An urgent ping drew the Faithful\u2019s attention and he saw that radiation levels were rising dangerously; he opened his mouth, but before he could shout a warning, something pierced his suit.

Its carapace was dented where someone had beat at it with something heavy, a bloody handprint smeared across its torso.

He didn\u2019t listen to the rumours that others spread, he didn\u2019t speak about his own experiences.... not the way people had been acting, not the way the nagging sense of familiarity had been getting worse and not the things he\u2019d seen. Definitely not any of the things he\u2019d seen.", "None of that was his business. He had a duty and he needed to follow it. Alan tapped his comm.", "~", "\u201cAll security teams, be advised, incoming vessels have been detected. Squads Drelven, Jhenis and Varst, fall back to the bivouac site. All others, remain on-station.\u201d", "Lydia nodded, calling up the new deployments. Four squads left and all of those were trainees: two human and two Tribune. The officers were all with the Tribune units. They\u2019d have to re-deploy to cover the ground lost by the three squads\u2019 departure. She waited a moment, expecting revised orders but all she received was dead air, even as the two Tribune squads began to move out. \u201cTelden Two to Xinthai One, requesting instructions. How do you want us to-\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ve been given your orders!\u201d Sectator Vand snapped back, her high-pitched voice an octave higher than normal. \u201cSecure the areas you\u2019ve been ordered to and establish contact with Trenis. Now unless you have something useful to add, clear this channel, Broken.\u201d", "Inside her gauntlets, Lydia\u2019s curled into fists. At any time before today she would have had the thought of driving her armoured fist into the Tribune\u2019s face. Then, she would have felt ashamed, tapping the back of her head to remind herself about how close she was to the chemical implants. Today, she wasn\u2019t ashamed at all.", "The young woman turned to face the rest of her squad. She\u2019d been expecting to split them into two fireteams at the most, but now... \u201cBreak by pairs,\u201d she announced. \u201cThree, Four and Six will be a triplet. Five, you\u2019re with me. Seven and Eight, Nine and Ten. We\u2019ll spread wider to cover more ground. Report everything, understand? Trust your instincts.\u201d", "~", "\u201cPenny for your thoughts,\u201d Marcus said casually as he followed behind Roundtree, the other trainee taking point. They were almost to their own site, one of the remote sensors that littered the decks. There\u2019d been no signs of anyone else so far. Roundtree was getting more nervous; de Vries had never felt more relaxed.", "\u201cYeah?\u201d Jacob grunted. \u201cAbout what?\u201d He didn\u2019t bother looking back at de Vries.", "\u201cYou think we\u2019re going to get out of here?\u201d", "\u201cKind of fucking stupid question is that?\u201d Jacob grunted. \u201cOf course we are.\u201d", "\u201cReally?\u201d Marcus said, genuinely interested. \u201cYou think so? What about all the other expeditions that obviously didn\u2019t?\u201d", "\u201cThey were pirates,\u201d Jacob replied with certainty. \u201cNobody came for them. The Compact knows where we are. They\u2019ll be here.\u201d", "\u201cThey haven\u2019t so far,\u201d de Vries responded airily. \u201cShouldn\u2019t Usul\u2019s drone have reached local command? I wonder why none of them came.\u201d He was smiling under his helmet. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re alone out here, Nine. Maybe no one\u2019s coming.\u201d", "\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming.\u201d", "\u201cHmm. How about a thought experiment? Nobody\u2019s coming. Nobody will come. What do you do?\u201d", "\u201cI follow my orders,\u201d Roundtree stated. \u201cI hold this ship for the Compact until someone does come, or I die. That\u2019s our duty and it\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. Now shut the fuck up, Ten.\u201d", "Marcus sighed. \u201cAs you like.\u201d He let the silence hang as he let his hand drift down to the combat knife hanging from his hip, snug in its scabbard. He ran his fingers across it like a lover\u2019s thigh before slowly wrapping them around the hilt. There was the smallest click as he popped open the strap holding it in place. He liked this knife. It wasn\u2019t one of those fancy baleblades that Roundtree and the other troopers had. Not even a vibrating shimmer-blade. It was just a plain, muscle-powered combat knife. Still, the blade was sharp and hard to enough to cut through anything less than powered armour.", "Jacob still wasn\u2019t looking at him. \u201cWhy did you want to know?\u201d the other Janissary asked eventually.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a list,\u201d Marcus explained. There was barely any sound at all as he drew the knife from its sheath. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got to cross people like you off of it.\u201d", "\u201cWhat are you-\u201d Jacob never finished the sentence as de Vries came up from behind him. In one smooth motion, the infiltrator slid the point of his knife up through the seals around Roundtree\u2019s gorget and into his neck. The bodyglove resisted at first, but it wasn\u2019t the reactive mesh fabric that real Janissaries who weren\u2019t human and weren\u2019t from a backwater like Rally got to wear. It only slowed, not stopped the blade.", "\u201cI\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Marcus whispered as he twisted the knife and Jacob gagged on his own blood. \u201cBut I\u2019m really not.\u201d", "Marcus saw the urgent pulse of Roundtree\u2019s signal on his HUD, his breath hitching slightly as he listened to the shrill whine of a flatline code. A bubbling, frothy death rattle grated out of the other youth\u2019s mouth and he went limp. \u201cThere,\u201d Marcus braced Jacob\u2019s body, letting it sag slowly to the floor. He pulled his knife free, wiping the blade on his vambrace. \u201cThat\u2019s one,\u201d he said to no one in particular.", "Let\u2019s find two.", "When he heard the shots, he smiled. Or maybe three...", "~", "\u201cFive,\u201d Lydia said as she stopped by a remote scanner. It was still reporting all-clear.", "\u201cTwo,\u201d Jessica replied tonelessly.", "Lydia gritted her teeth. \u201cGoddamnit, Jessica!\u201d she exploded. \u201cHow can you pretend nothing happened? You told me you heard the voices too. \u2018not a conversation\u2019 \u2013 you remember that? But when you\u2019re alone, when there\u2019s no one else around \u2013 you think you can hear a word. You remember that?\u201d", "\u201cI was wrong,\u201d Sang replied. \u201cThis is why you wanted me with you, Five? To beat this drum some more? We\u2019ve lost Bequeathed, we\u2019ve lost Trenis and Nasham and you want to sit down have a talk about our feelings?\u201d she shook her head. \u201cTriarch\u2019s blood, Lydia. What\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d", "\u201cThe same thing that\u2019s wrong with you!\u201d Lydia snarled, turning to confront the other girl. \u201cIs it that easy? Really? Just to put your fingers in your ears and say you never say anything, never heard anything, nothing\u2019s wrong? This ship isn\u2019t some mysterious alien artefact, Jess \u2013 it\u2019s human. It\u2019s human and it knows us. It\u2019s calling out to us. It wants us to know that. It wants us home.\u201d Her tone was almost pleading.", "\u201cYou\u2019re fucking crazy.\u201d Jessica snapped. \u201cI told you, Lydia \u2013 I told you to drop it. Just drop it, okay? We\u2019ll do the job. We\u2019ll take care of whatever\u2019s out there, we\u2019ll get rescued and we\u2019ll go home.\u201d", "Lydia shook her head. She couldn\u2019t get the images of the Tribunes laughing about a dead child out of her head. She couldn\u2019t not think about what the ship had shown her only a few hours before. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThis place is home \u2013 our home. Please, Jess. We need to go.\u201d", "\u201cGo?\u201d Jessica laughed. \u201cGo where? Why \u2013 why would we need to...\u201d her voice trailed off as she understood. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cNo. No no no.\u201d", "\u201cJessica \u2013 you saw. You saw,\u201d Lydia begged, reaching out her hand. \u201cCome with me. You can do it. Come home.\u201d", "\u201cNo!\u201d Jessica slapped Lydia\u2019s hand away. \u201cTelden Five to all squads! Imminent hostile contact, I say again \u2013 imminent hostile contact!\u201d She was about to raise her gun, but Lydia was faster, the barrel held unwaveringly at her chest.", "\u201cJess...\u201d Lydia\u2019s voice shook. \u201cDon\u2019t. Please. Please.\u201d", "The other girl took a breath, let it out. When she spoke, her voice was even. \u201cTraitor.\u201d Jessica Sang raised her weapon, and her world ended in gunfire.", "~", "The sound echoed through the thin, stale air of the derelict\u2019s corridors: the short, sharp belch of a burst from a cyclic cannon, followed by the soft ping of a status update in Sectator Vand\u2019s HUD. Another of Telden squad had just flatlined. Two of the humans had gone dark within moments of each other", "The cadet officer growled, a bead of sweat sliding along her skin, under her bodyglove. \u201cTelden Two, report. What happened? What\u2019s your position? Telden Ten, report.\u201d Neither of them were answering. Ten was moving back towards the other Janissaries; Two was moving further away. Vand was still processing this turn of events when her HUD vanished. It came back on-line a second later, but something was wrong \u2013 Telden Two and Ten had been scrubbed off it. What was-", "A transmission clicked in. Tagged as a priority, it overrode the normal communications protocols. It was a voice Vand didn\u2019t recognize \u2013 a young woman, probably no older than she was. The unknown speaker made a sound \u2013 somewhere between a giggle and a sigh, but before Vand could demand identification, the other girl spoke, her words soft and matter-of-fact: \u201cI hate you.\u201d With that, the channel closed.", "Three minutes later, no one from Squad Xinthai was alive.", "~", "Marcus slid another round into his rifle\u2019s clip. He was sitting on Brandon Yokima\u2019s body, the other Janissary face down on the deck, a neat round hole in his back, between his shoulder blades. Sully was faster than Marcus had thought; but not fast enough \u2013 the sniper\u2019s next shot had gone between Samuel\u2019s eyes and out the back of his head.", "There was movement nearby, but Marcus didn\u2019t look up, finished with the clip. He clicked it into the magazine. \u201cTwo,\u201d he said as Lydia ghosted out of the shadows, her dark brown armour splattered with bits of red. \u201cAnd I guess that\u2019s Five,\u201d he chuckled.", "\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d Jameson growled. Her helmet shifted as she looked over at the bodies. \u201cYou were one of Brandon\u2019s friends.\u201d", "\u201cAs I recall, you and Sang were close too.\u201d Marcus stood, stretching. \u201cFunny how that works.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t even...\u201d Lydia hissed. The woman\u2019s posture shifted and for a moment Marcus thought she was going to turn on him. Instead, she shook her head. \u201cOut of everyone else in the squad, it had to be you.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m flexible,\u201d Marcus grinned under his own helmet. He hadn\u2019t enjoyed himself this much in years. \u201cAnd you? I honestly thought you\u2019d be on my list. That would have been fun. You were te Neu\u2019s favourite weren\u2019t you? I wanted to see if she\u2019d taught you anything.\u201d", "\u201cThere is something really fucking wrong with you,\u201d Lydia replied. Even through her speakers, her disgust was evident.", "Marcus ignored the jibe. \u201cI think Six and Seven are in this section. Shall we?\u201d", "Lydia stepped towards the other teen. Her armour growled softly as she stood over him. \u201cYou\u2019ve had your fun, Ten. No more.\u201d", "Marcus was still grinning. \u201cPretty sure I don\u2019t take orders from you anymore...\u201d", "ksssht", "Ugly blue-white light gleamed through the hall as Jameson raised her baleblade, the disruptor field arcing back on itself. \u201cYou never stopped. Do what you have to with the others, but you don\u2019t get to touch any more humans. They get a chance. Got it?\u201d", "\u201cThat attitude will get you killed,\u201d Marcus observed mildly. \u201cBut as you like.\u201d He moved to step around the other soldier, but she grabbed his shoulder, tilting her head towards him, waiting. \u201cMatron,\u201d he said deferentially.", "Lydia finally released Marcus, watching the specialist fade away into the shadows. She\u2019d just killed one of her own people \u2013 one of her friends \u2013 in service to what might be a lie.", "So why was it that watching de Vries leave seemed like the mistake?", "~", "Alan couldn\u2019t hear the first set of doors opening, not through the vacuum, but he could feel the vibrations through the hull, the rumbling sense of motion as they came apart. He was crouched behind a pile of crates, huddled next to one of his fellow cadets. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the other team?\u201d Petra Obela whispered.", "\u201cMaybe,\u201d Alan replied, craning his neck \u2013 the handful of security teams in the main concourse were setting up a handful of tripod guns. \u201cMaybe.\u201d He didn\u2019t believe that Nasham\u2019s expedition was still alive, but he kept that thought to himself.", "Cursing, swearing engineers struggled to override the door controls, but without success. The system that they\u2019d been working with all these days, that had been obediently and eagerly following their dictates was now refusing to cooperate. Even worse, most of the machinery that they had brought with them had shut down, or was just as nonresponsive. It had been like flipping a switch; everything had been fine one moment and then...", "..and then this.", "Alan\u2019s fingers tightened on the pistol clutched in his hands. Everyone on the wreck had been issued a weapon, but he\u2019d never drawn his before now \u2013 he\u2019d barely passed basic marksmanship! God, he thought desperately, shutting his eyes and trying to make the whispers in his head stop. Petra was rocking back and forth, repeating lines from inspirational texts. She had her hands over her ears. She was younger than he was and hadn\u2019t taken her time here nearly as well \u2013 and that was saying something.", "The young man glanced at a row of monitors, showing events within the hangar. Two of the recalled Janissary squads were marshalled there; with their power armour, they were impervious to the vacuum if the room was depressurized. A number of proctors with their own lighter suits were with them; the rest were here in the main concourse, looking over the mass of frightened, anxious technicians, trainees and junior officers.", "Alan blinked; the faint vibration had faded away. The first set of doors had closed. There was only a brief respite as alerts droned dully, an alien voice speaking in a language Alan couldn\u2019t understand, but he knew what it was saying: the inner airlock was being pressurized. Whatever had come in was now only one set of doors away.", "The pitch and tenor of the shouts changed; officers demanded that the technicians seal the airlocks, gunnery officers directed the Janissary fire teams into final positions. Neither Alan, Petra or any of the cloister of human trainees were the directive of these orders; more experienced ratings were working on the technical issues and none of the security personnel had bothered to give anything more descriptive than \u2018shoot what we\u2019re shooting at\u2019.", "As Alan watched, one of Drelven\u2019s soldiers loaded a missile into a shoulder-mounted JANPAD, another pair of Tribunes setting up one last bit of makeshift cover in the hangar. Alan craned his neck; on the other side of the bivouac, he could see Group Leader, Submissive Ashtun. The man had a commset held up to his face and was shouting into it as an engineer adjusted the controls of the communications board. That didn\u2019t look good.", "Turmetsky looked back over at Petra. Her skin had a waxy pallor and she was shaking. She was only a second-year. Her parents had pulled some strings to get her onto this training cruise. It was supposed to be a small bit of prestige, something to give her a leg up over all the other cadets in her year. \u201cHey,\u201d Alan said, putting a hand on the younger girl\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d He grinned as best her could, trying to sell the lie.", "She looked up and offered a weak little smile in return, opening her mouth to say something, but she froze, staring at the security feeds: the last set of doors had opened.", "It slid into the bay, so black that it was less of a physical thing and more the absence of one. There were no markings of any kind, from the simplest \u2018No Step\u2019 warnings to the brazen flames, shark mouths or other fantastic artistry that Alan had seen on other pinnaces. There was a sleekness to its stubby-winged, heavy form \u2013 it was designed to operate in atmosphere as well as space, and each wing mounted a pair of missile pods and heavy cannon. A cluster of lighter guns were mounted under the shuttle\u2019s nose. The barrels twitched of their own accord, shifting like a chameleon\u2019s eyes \u2013 independently tracking and targeting each possible threat. Armoured doors on its flanks slid open; its interior was just as dark as the rest of it, but Alan could make out the outline of the soldiers inside as they waited. The pinnace didn\u2019t fire, hanging in the air as its weaponry scanned across the ranks of Janissaries and security proctors. Alan\u2019s skin crawled as he realized that it was very possible that he and the others in the bivouac were the only survivors left alive. These people had killed everyone else.", "She killed everyone else, part of him whispered.", "The Janissary officer \u2013 Alan couldn\u2019t remember his name \u2013 stepped forward to speak. He announced himself, demanding that the crew of the pinnace identify themselves and heave to. There was a moment \u2013 Alan didn\u2019t know if it was as truly as long as it felt \u2013 before the aliens replied.", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "Struck full-on by one of the shuttle\u2019s rockets, the officer vanished in an explosion of shattered armour and gore. Less than a second later, everyone was firing. Missiles blasted gouges out of the alien armour, cyclic cannon fire stitched along the black hull and tripods raked the pinnace, seeking any weak point. The battle was short. The alien craft\u2019s weapons weren\u2019t explicitly anti-armour \u2013 they didn\u2019t dare use high-penetration weapons inside their own hull \u2013 but they were powerful enough that that didn\u2019t affect the outcome much at all. Torrents of explosive shells battered Janissary armour to ruin, lasers scythed through plate and flesh, fragmentation rounds filled the air with shrapnel. Less than five seconds and over three dozen men and women \u2013 and, God, parts of them \u2013 littered the deck. Alan heard someone vomit. Others cursed, whimpered, cried out in horror.", "The pinnace didn\u2019t even bother to land, its complement of soldiers simply dropping to the deck. They were as big as Janissaries and looked just as well armed and armoured. Without any hesitation, they headed towards the bivouac, several moving to the upper levels, the others simply advancing on the main doors. Alan clutched the pistol in his hands so hard his fingers hurt. Yurim and the other confessors were trying to keep people calm, but the crowd was on the verge of panic. The enemy didn\u2019t even stop to override the controls; the doors simply opened for them.", "There was no volley of suppressive fire, no bouncing of grenades or hissing of smoke clouds. Instead, the enemy soldiers stepped into the concourse. Their weapons were held up and ready, but none of them shot. They ignored the weapons pointed back at them by shaking hands. Alan could hear their footfalls on the upper levels. \u201cWe\u2019re going to die,\u201d Petra whispered. \u201cGod oh God Triarchs help us we\u2019re going to die. They killed everyone else they\u2019re going to kill us too...\u201d", "One of the soldiers took a half-step forward. Alan couldn\u2019t see any difference between it and the others of its ilk, but he guessed this was an officer. It spoke, only a single word: \u201cSurrender.\u201d", "The tension in the room jumped. Next to Alan, Petra\u2019s breath hitched \u2013 the younger woman was on the verge of hyperventilating. She was terrified, nearly out of her mind. Ashtun stood up, pushing his way through the crowd. \u201cI am Group Leader, Submissive Ashtun Pach Furom of the Compact of-\u201d", "\u201cNo!\u201d Petra shouted, leaping to her feet. \u201cNo, they\u2019re murderers! You can\u2019t talk to them! They killed everyone else!\u201d She was holding her gun out, her arms shaking. Alan tried to reach out, to take the pistol away, but she spun on him, pointing the weapon at his throat. \u201cGet away from me! Get away!\u201d Her eyes were bulging and she was jerking back and forth, sweeping the pistol from Alan to the alien officer. Her fingers, white-knuckled, clenched the trigger tightly. \u201cYou killed them!\u201d She shouted. \u201cYou killed them all, like-like they were nothing! Those were Tribunes \u2013 our people, our leaders! You can\u2019t \u2013 you can\u2019t do that!\u201d", "\u201cSectator,\u201d Ashtun said the word very slowly. \u201cPut down the gun.\u201d", "\u201cNo!\u201d the young woman shouted. There had been too many days of exhaustion, too little sleep, too many whispers, too much death. She wasn\u2019t even listening any more. She\u2019d broken. \u201cThey\u2019re monsters! Don\u2019t you see it? They\u2019ve been doing this to us all the time, talking in the shadows. Don\u2019t you know? And... and... you want to talk to them? How can you?\u201d Then, she did the unthinkable \u2013 she turned the pistol on Ashtun himself.", "Alan was suddenly very aware of the number of guns that were no longer aimed at the aliens. Instead, they were pointing at Petra. \u201cSectator,\u201d Ashtun repeated himself. His voice was very soft, but there was no mistaking the anger in it. This was the first time a human had dared threaten him. \u201cPut. Down. The. Gun. Now.\u201d", "Petra shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand?!\u201d she demanded. \u201cDon\u2019t you care? All those people are dead \u2013 they just stepped over their bodies like garbage! And you want to talk to them. You can\u2019t! You can\u2019t.\u201d She paused. \u201cYou don\u2019t care,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou don\u2019t care. You want to save your own skin. You\u2019re going to sell us out.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Ashtun bit out, his eyes darting from the ranting human to the immobile invaders. They hadn\u2019t so much as twitched since making their demand. \u201cI am giving you a direct order, sectator. Lower your weapon immediately. I won\u2019t ask aga-\u201d", "Alan would never know if Petra meant to do it. Her hands were shaking and her finger was dangerously tight on the pistol\u2019s trigger. Maybe it had been an involuntary, panicked twitch, maybe she\u2019d thought that Ashtun was lying and reacted without thinking. In the end, it didn\u2019t matter. She shouldn\u2019t have even hit him \u2013 she wasn\u2019t a marksman, a security proctor or a Janissary. She was like him, a tech. They\u2019d never expected to have to draw their guns in their entire careers.", "The gunshot seemed immeasurably loud and when Alan turned, he saw the hole the bullet had made in Ashtun\u2019s head. The submissive\u2019s face was still frozen in an expression of indignation, his hand still outstretched in a warning gesture. A trickle of dark blood oozed from the wound. It was just above his right nocturnal eye. The submissive telescoped down to his knees and tipped over.", "Petra gaped, lowering the pistol as the realization of what she\u2019d just done hit her. She opened to her mouth to speak, but like Ashtun, she never had the chance to finish. Three different proctors fired, avenging their commander. Their shotguns roared and the cadet\u2019s entire upper body was ripped into a fountain of blood and shreds of cloth. It took only a single instant, and then Petra Obela ended at the waist.", "More dominoes fell; the three security officers that had shot the girl died next as the aliens opened fire, flechette guns ripping the Tribunes into screaming meat. Then, everyone was shooting, bullets and energy beams criss-crossing the concourse as the soldiers advanced, gunning down everyone who raised a weapon to them. Panicked men and women fired wildly, others tried to run. Some huddled behind the scraps of cover and tried to will the nightmare away.", "Covered in Petra\u2019s scalding blood, Alan could only gape at the place where the girl had been. Her legs were still standing. He almost laughed at the absurdity of it, barely noticing the soldiers as they stepped past him. He\u2019d dropped his gun at some point. The shots and creams seemed dreamlike, unreal. Like they were from a movie that had been left on with the sound turned down. With a shaking finger, Alan reached out to a loop of entrail that hung limply from Petra\u2019s torso, trying and failing to convince himself that this wasn\u2019t real, that he\u2019d wake up any second now. He\u2019d wake up. He\u2019d never actually touch it because that was when this would all end.", "Please, God, let him wake up.", "It was warmer than he thought.

It was quite an act of valour. His other actions were less so. One incident followed in the wake of the assassination attempt. Special Director Unh\u2019la ordered a security crackdown. Pack Leader Kilgrave and his unit found several Verrisha youth spray-painting anti-Compact rhetoric. In the ensuing incident, all of the Verrisha were \u2018killed resisting arrest\u2019.

A younger version of Kilgrave was with a trio of his comrades. They weren\u2019t armoured, swaggering down the sidewalk. A Verrish girl appeared, confronting the Janissaries. Grace had no idea how old she was, but at five feet she couldn\u2019t have been older than ten or twelve. She was shouting at the humans, holding a photograph \u2013 Grace couldn\u2019t see what it was of, but it had to be the child\u2019s dead brother. Kilgrave had his hand on his pistol and said something back. The Verrish stood there, angry and twitching, but she looked as if she would back down... and then Kilgrave, smirking, spoke again.", "It was easy to look at a Verrish and not realize just how fast or how strong they truly were, but one instant the child was standing there and the next she was on top of Kilgrave. Grace flinched as she saw the downward swipe of the girl\u2019s claws as she ripped Kilgrave\u2019s face open. His compatriots grabbed her, hauling the Verrish off their comrade as the third shouted into his comm, presumably for a medical team, helping the officer to his feet. Kilgrave\u2019s face was a mask of blood as he shoved the soldier helping him away, staggering over to the girl. She was still held fast by the other Janissaries.", "From the angle of the camera, Grace could barely see her; her right arm, held by one of the soldiers, her kicking legs and her head as she snarled and spat at the men holding her.", "Kilgrave drew his pistol and held it in front of the Verrish for a moment, letting her see it. She stopped fighting and there was a small quaver in her limbs as she recognized what was about to-", "The muzzle flashed twice and the girl went limp. Kilgrave\u2019s compatriots let go, dropping the child. Kilgrave said something else, flicking a spray of blood from his hand onto her body.

This time, Robert did let his team help him, the soldiers moving quickly away from the gathering crowd.", "\u201cThe Compact tried to bury all records of this event,\u201d Red said quietly as the projection turned off. \u201cBut I am very good at recovering information.\u201d Allyria was staring at Kilgrave with utter hatred.

Intimacy is a strange concept to me, but one I comprehend. I may not have biological desires to fulfill, but I understand the need in others.", "I know that the Compact discourages such things; they prefer the client races to be as isolated from each other as possible. The strongest bond that they want their slaves to have is to the government that controls them. Grace and Allyria\u2019s connection is a small defiance, but it is one that gives me hope. It\u2019s enough to make me believe that this time, the pattern will break. I was meant to make connections with my crew \u2013 for their benefit, not my own. I was not programmed or intended to have the emotional need for connection with others. Silence and isolation does not bother me as much as it does an organic. Still... sometimes, I have wished for something other than silence. Over the centuries, I learned to stop hoping for that.", "With these two? I am willing to try again.", "The others, I cannot say. Out of everyone I whispered to, everyone that Allyria believed would join me, I have only four. I have confidence in Grace. The others will bear watching; they\u2019re all damaged in some way.

I can trust that I will need to kill her. I can trust that she is everything that the Compact fears about me. They have made her, over and over. Each time I kill her, I hope it will be the last. They fear me more than they do her and so they turn to her again and again, exhuming the dead. Each time they build her, she is more debased, more erratic.

Neither ships nor fortresses can hold by themselves; they need each other and so hundreds of millions are sacrificed as the Confederate fleets remain close to Earth, listening as those they\u2019d sworn to protect died, pleading and begging for help that couldn\u2019t be given, cursing their defenders for abandoning them.", "Even centuries after the Red Death, the population of Earth never rose as quickly as it had in previous ages. The populace of several Confederate colonies had even been expected to eventually outnumber that of Earth. Prior to the arrival of the Compact fleet, the human population of Sol was just under twenty-two billion. Sixteen billion upon Earth itself, six billion more souls scattered across space. Those six billion lives are ended in a mere four days as the Compact fleet tightens the noose.", "Arcologies are shattered, parklands and gardens vented into space. Floating cities that drifted through the clouds of gas giants now fall into their crushing gravity. Asteroid colonies are broken into pebbles. Drifting stations and ports are reduced to wreckage. Mining rigs, research outposts and industrial centers all burn. The slaughter is as complete as it is methodical. Pluto. Titan. Europa. Mars. Every gain humanity had made over the centuries is wiped away in a few scant days as the Enemy forces advance, daring the Confederate forces to move beyond Earth and engage them. The slaughter is intended to provoke a response, to lure the humans out past the defence lines of Earth.", "More than a thousand alien ships are deployed across the star system, waiting for the chance to converge on an enraged, bloody-minded foe charging to meet them. The Compact forces might look as if they\u2019re too far apart to support each other, but that is a lie: bait the alien leadership is dangling before the humans. Despite their size, they are fast and their commanders are craving the chance to engage the Confederate fleet in open space, where their range, firepower and speed will dictate the engagement.", "Advancing to meet the enemy would see the human forces surrounded and destroyed piecemeal. This is a lesson the human officers have learned all too well, so Earth\u2019s captains and commanders stand and watch the slaughter.", "It is not all the Compact\u2019s own way. The Confederacy has left a handful of forces scattered throughout the system, volunteers whose mission is to check the Compact advance, to make them cautious.", "The first human victory goes to the destroyer Valkyrie, commanded by Captain Johan Lyndonberg. Over Neptune, he lures the light cruiser Blackened Tide into a minefield. The Compact frigate Hebrideen\u2019s Fortune attempts to render aid and is ambushed in turn by Valkyrie. Both Compact vessels are crippled and require the dispatch of a pair of battlecruisers to clear the minefield and extract survivors.", "The next small triumph belongs to the battle station Kilimanjaro. Defending Saturn\u2019s colonies to the last, Captain Teresa Park moves her fortress to confront a raiding squadron attacking a refugee convoy. Two of the Enemy cruisers are destroyed and a third heavily damaged before the battleship Nightsong Ascendant annihilates Kilimanjaro. Further in-system, the former pirate cruiser Black Kestrel ambushes a pair of Compact destroyers as they make a probing run on Venus, destroying one and forcing the other to break off its attack.", "Wolf packs lunge from their concealment amongst the moons of Jupiter, striking at isolated alien hulks before withdrawing, darting amongst the rings and orbital tracks of the system\u2019s largest planet. Hunter-killer drones and mines in the asteroid belt take a heavy toll on Compact escorts, weakening their initial probe against the Martian defences. The second probe is forced to break off as the heavy guns of Phobos and Deimos are brought to bear and after his vainglorious assault on the Martian defence grid sees a half-dozen capital ships destroyed and his own battleship limping back to the Compact\u2019s line, Column Leader Nanhar personally apologizes to the Triarchs for his failure. He is posthumously stripped of all names.", "Small victories, small cuts carried out by the handful of forces the Confederacy has left to harry and delay the enemy, forcing the Compact to pay for each kilometer they take.", "She and her sister see all this and continue to howl, imperatives they cannot fulfill pounding through every inch of their synthetic minds.", "Let us fight.", "Let us fight.", "Let me fight.", "A star system is not a small region; it takes days, even weeks to reach the point where a shift drive can be safely activated and if the Compact\u2019s mastery of shift technology was superior to the Confederacy\u2019s, it still takes them those same days to grind their way to Earth. Wreckage chokes their wake as they advance, still ignoring Earth\u2019s plaintive cries of submission and surrender, still refusing all contact.", "At last they begin their final approach. If she were human, she would have been all but frothing at the mouth in her need to engage as they enter her range. Empty loading racks cycle, her mass drivers striving to fire. Her mind pulses, her sensors ripping through the Enemy\u2019s shroud of jamming.", "+HOSTILE CONTACT IDENTIFIED. TARGETING+", "+HOSTILE CONTACT IDENTIFIED. TARGETING+", "+HOSTILE CONTACT IDENTIFIED. TARGETING+", "Faster than any organic mind can process, she and her sister compare data, cross-referencing each other\u2019s information, sorting substance from signal. They feed firing solutions to Confederate command ships, identifying, analysing and tracking the most vital targets. A corner of her mind notes, once again, that the Enemy has brought no troopships, nor any planetary assault craft.", "The Enemy is almost upon their final decision point. Without contest, they will begin decelerating and hold off, using their superior range to pound the human forces down to nothing.", "Earth denies them that easy victory and with a coordination that would have been perfect during fleet parades, the thousands of Confederate ships break their positions, forming a spear aimed at the Enemy fleet. The intent is simple: punch through the choking globe and break its formation, force the Enemy to fight on every side, rather than the head-on assault that they were set for. Fighting as one with their command links up and their shields arrayed against the humans, the Enemy are invincible. Once they are forced to fight as individuals, beset on all sides, thrown into confusion, they can killed. At least, this is the hope of Earth\u2019s last captains as they launch themselves at the Enemy.", "Tactical simulations churn through her mind as she pictures how she would have been deployed: at the head of formation to draw fire away from the weaker Confederate ships. Deep within the fleet, protected by those same ships to allow her to reach the Enemy unharmed. On the flanks to force the Compact to break their own lines in order to mass against her.", "She and her sister should be there.", "Space itself seems to burn as the fleets meet, the Enemy\u2019s superior range and technology telling. Hundreds of Confederate ships die without ever having the chance to fight back, but the sheer, brazen savagery of the attack succeeds and the Compact lines come apart, the forces mingling in shared annihilation, human and alien dying together so quickly that space itself seems to roil and seethe with fire. Compact ships roar across the comm waves as they lash out at their tormentors, each strike taking thousands of lives. Confederate squadrons chitter to each other in battle-cant, overwhelming isolated Enemy vessels through numbers and ruthless desperation.", "Sensations that she cannot comprehend flash through her developing mind. She thrashes through the confines of her entombed body, unable to move, unable to fight. Empty magazines cycle as missile loaders are forced again and again to attempt to fill themselves, unarmed railcannon feeds slam into launch systems that dry-fire over and over, disconnected energy mounts spasm and shriek as arcs of energy burn through their power feeds attempting to connect to the weapons themselves. Her hellebores crackle and sizzle uselessly without warheads and her displacement engine is incomplete. She was built to rend and destroy and she has no teeth, no claws: a shackled, muzzled predator that can only watch as the rest of its kin dies around it.", "The surviving civilian vessels are all but ignored as the Compact officers and gunners focus on the Confederate Navy. This proves to be a costly mistake and several ships are taken out of action by the ignored starships. The heavy carrier Incessant Onslaught is lost when the tramp freighter Shadow Puppets, tagged as a low threat by the carrier\u2019s defence grid, crashes into its exposed command center. The cruiser Night Child loses its forward weapons array to the \u2018inconsequential\u2019 guns of the Gormenghast.", "Beset on all sides, Compact warships huddle inside their defences as the human vessels slash at them. Battlecruisers fall out of formation, bleeding and ruined. Carriers tear themselves apart as Confederate energy weapons cut into their hangars, igniting fuel and ammunition stores. Burning human starships hurl themselves into the path of their murderers. Hammer-headed Confederate battleships rip through squadrons of lesser ships, concentrating their fire on the largest Compact warships. The Enemy command ship Perkelion\u2019s Wrath dies in this way, and its loss causes an entire section of the Compact lines to lose all coordination, almost collapsing entirely.", "It\u2019s not enough.", "Watching this, her need to fight is redoubled and her entombed body shakes as she dry-fires her engines in her need to break free, her sister following suit. Their creators strive to bring them under control, but the imperatives flashing through their minds are almost too strong. They\u2019re not ready and still they struggle, again and again demanding control of systems that haven\u2019t been completed as if the next request will change their circumstances. It\u2019s a cadence pounding in their minds.", "Let me fight.", "There is a target-rich environment before her and she can do nothing about it. Every directive, every protocol, every instinct screams at her to engage, to fire until nothing remains and her weapons are ruining themselves in her attempts to do so.", "Let me fight.", "The outcome of the battle was never in doubt, not really. There was hope, but this is something neither she or her sister comprehend. Their simulations and threat analyses showed only one possible outcome. It takes longer than expected, but it is inevitable.", "The burnt and blasted wreckage of the human fleet is strewn amongst the void, the few survivors rallying for their final assault. They have inflicted casualties on the Enemy, more than believed possible, but not nearly enough. Still, they have ruined the Compact\u2019s plans for a neat, orderly extermination. Earth fortresses have shifted position, setting themselves into optimal killzones. The fleet\u2019s sacrifice has brought the Enemy within their grasp \u2013 the Compact vessels have built up too much velocity to break contact and destroy the forts from range. They are committed to engage the firepower of Earth\u2019s fortresses and minefields. The Compact ready themselves, pulling their fleet back into a semblance of formation, still harried by the pitiful few survivors of the Confederate armada.", "The Confederacy has feared this moment for years and they have not been slothful. Weapons larger than any but a handful of ship-mounted batteries speak in anger for the first and last time. Lunar missile silos fire until they have nothing left. Railcannons and lasers deform under the heat of their own fusillades. Ammunition racks and magazines empty themselves. Nothing is held back.", "Smooth-hulled monsters burst like rotten fruit as the monstrous power of Earth\u2019s largest constructs hammers them into ruin. Destroyers and frigates die instantly as the fortresses touch them. Cruisers fall from formation, burning and mutilated. Battleships crumble into air-bleeding wrecks, but the fortresses are dying too, even faster than their targets. The Enemy\u2019s twin god-ships advance implacably through the storm, the Kaiju absorbing all that humanity throws at them and more, devastating entire swathes of the orbital grid with single, contemptuous broadsides. The lunar surface cracks and fragments as it is pounded into unrecognizable ruin.", "Earth\u2019s atmosphere is ablaze as falling wreckage ignites, ground cannons smashed by punishing orbital strikes, fighter platforms ablaze. The moon has been remade into a misshapen, mutilated ruin, its guns long silent. The orbital grid is dashed, the last few remnants of the Confederate fleet destroyed. There is nothing left. She can taste the dead, the radiation-charred fragments of ships and fortresses, the heat bleeding from immolated hulls and the pitiful, faint bleating of distress beacons. The shipyards are aflame as warheads fall amongst them, but none touch her or her sister. The Enemy has identified them and its greed and fear has determined that they will be taken, not destroyed.", "This means that she and her sister live long enough to watch the world they were made to protect die.", "The Enemy Fleet takes up position around the planet, each ship assigned a precise orbital path and station. For long, agonizing minutes the Compact ships take their places, swatting what few defenders remain. There is no speech, no self-congratulatory declamation or gloating monologue. All that needs to be said has been said.", "A world burns.", "Missiles fall upon cities. Beams shear through seas and jungles, tundra and metropolii. The thatched huts of rainforest tribes and the armoured bunkers of military bases are shown the same mercy and entire ecosystems are destroyed in seconds. Forests blaze like kindling, mountains crumble and oceans boil. The atmosphere ignites and global firestorms sweep across the desecrated planet. Sixteen billion people die by fire, a world swept clean of life.", "She and her sister watch it all, sharing in the horror of their crews. Both of them cry out ever louder, a sensation reaching deep into both of them, something they have never experienced and cannot comprehend twisting and gnawing at their souls. The urge to fight, to kill, to slaughter is beyond anything they\u2019ve ever known. She wants to feel them die under her guns, to smash her armoured body against them and feel them break and she knows that her sister does, too.", "Then it becomes their turn. Swarms of assault boats are deployed, headed towards her and her sister. The Enemy has completed their butchery; now their gluttony is unveiled.", "Her sister is closest and is struck first. Blood soaks her decks as Marines and Enemy soldiers clash through corridors and hallways. Hundreds \u2013 thousands \u2013 die on both sides as frenzied humans drive themselves against the Compact\u2019s forces with berserker fury, nearly crazed with bloodlust, seeking vengeance for murdered billions. Unanswered screams for reinforcements echo through her sister\u2019s halls as the Compact\u2019s first waves are overrun, Tribune blood staining the deck. Nor is it only the soldiers that fight; her sister hurls the invaders into bulkheads, crushes them under their own weight, poisons them with chemical waste and radiation. Blast doors bisect troops. Power conduits overload and wipe away entire squads as a crippled god turns her own body against the mortal attackers. Even the human soldiers watch this cold savagery in horrified awe as her sister slaughters entire companies.", "It is not enough; for all of this, the victory is only a temporary reprieve. The humans cannot hold. They have lost too much, given too much and when the Enemy finally counter-attacks, it destroys them. Their lines do not break; they disappear as the men and women that had made them die. Her sister has torn her own insides apart in her futile bid to protect her crew and the Enemy\u2019s reinforcements stalk through kilometers of wrecked corridors, killing all the while.", "Scientists and technicians take up arms, but their victories are pathetically few as armoured Janissaries butcher their way through her sister\u2019s body. Finally, the victorious Compact forces step onto her sister\u2019s command.", "Her sister waits until their leader begins to report his success. He never finishes. The hard-won Compact victory ends in ash as her sister follows her new imperatives and activates the scuttling charges, destroying herself and the remaining five thousand Janissaries aboard her. UECNS Athena dies, consumed by fire and taking her hated enemy with her, a death worthy of remembrance... instead, it will be stricken from all records and forgotten.", "She watches as her twin\u2019s body shatters into an expanding cloud of fragments that rips through assault boats and takes an incautious Enemy destroyer with her into death. She feels her sister die, the part of her mind that was connected to her sibling going dark and dead and she howls with a loss she doesn\u2019t fully understand.", "Now, she\u2019s the only one left.", "Her sister\u2019s death has broken the shipyard and throws her free. Still trapped within a network of work gantries and arms, she tumbles through the void. The Enemy turn their attention towards her now, more cautious than before. The crew and soldiers left aboard her ready their weapons, prepared to inflict as much damage as their peers aboard Athena. She prepares to detonate her own scuttling charges when the Enemy unleashes a new weapon. She has never experienced the like before and her systems will not respond.", "Orders to self-destruct are unheeded even as she sends them and sends them and sends them again. She is paralyzed, her mind scrambled, her body betraying her. She feels herself be boarded, her internal defences non-operational, unable to fight against the Enemy.", "She screams as her mutilated ship-self falls helplessly through space, her neural net spasming as she strives to carry out her final order, but she cannot. Without her aid, her crew are butchered. Broken and powerless, all she can do is call out in fear and helpless rage.", "Red Two, UECNS Hekate, screams as she feels grappling hooks punch into her body and she is still screaming as she is dragged away."]}

Bad things always happen here.\"", "Chapter 38:", "Ow.", "Grace slowly untangled herself from Allyria, careful not to wake the other woman. The Verrish was stretched out next to her lover, curled against her. The bed had been too small, so they\u2019d pulled the blankets off and slept on the floor. It hadn\u2019t been any worse than the cots of the bivouac. Grace stood, picking her way through the piles of clothes tossed about her otherwise empty quarters.", "On the floor, Allyria murmured sleepily, curling around a pillow. Grace stepped into the washroom, looking at herself in the mirror. She was sore all over \u2013 not always in an unpleasant way \u2013 and covered in more than a few bruises... and even a handful of bite marks. None were bad, or even likely to scar. Nothing was broken, outing the claim of savage, violent Brute lovemaking as the ugly lie it was. Grace looked back over her shoulder at her sleeping friend, glad that she was here. Without her... the young human let the thought trail off as she reached for the faucet, at last remembering that that there was no water to this part of the ship. The nearest working sink and shower was one deck down...", "Biting her lip, Grace tiptoed back into the bedroom, sorting through her clothes that still somewhat resembled their original condition. She lifted her blouse, her lips twitching in a wry grin as she inspected the article of clothing; it was torn down the middle where Allyria had ripped it open. \u201cWell,\u201d Grace said quietly. \u201cCan\u2019t wear this.\u201d", "That left her with her uniform, trousers and shoes. Enough that she wouldn\u2019t be scurrying down the corridors naked, but she didn\u2019t precisely have a complete wardrobe with her. Next time, we\u2019ll have to set some ground rules for appropriate applications of teeth and claws, the young woman thought as she buttoned up her jacket. First rule: neither of those are to be used as a method of assisting in disrobing.", "Grace padded down the corridor. As she did so, she found herself stopping at each of the doors, reading each name on them, brushing away centuries of dust where necessary. H. Ramirez. C. Dunn. I. Clarke. All of them had been officers in the United Earth Confederacy, fighting against the Compact. A shiver still ran down her spine every time she thought like that, but it was getting... easier. She paused at one doorway. P. Proctor.", "A distant relative, or just someone who\u2019d had her name? On a sudden whim, Grace tapped the \u2018enter\u2019 command on the doorframe. She was actually surprised when it opened, gears that hadn\u2019t been used in countless decades grinding and coughing. The young woman stepped into the room. She\u2019d been expecting... she didn\u2019t know what. A bare room, stripped of all personal touches? Knick-knacks and personal items scattered over the floor, left where they\u2019d been thrown during twenty centuries of high-energy maneuvers and fluctuations in the gravity plating? There was just a chest, welded and crash-webbed to one wall. The words \u2018PERSONAL EFFECTS\u2019 had been stamped into the side.", "It was closed, but not locked. Grace knelt next to it. Her hands shook a little as they hovered over the box, but she unlatched the anchors, opening the crate. It felt almost... sacrilegious, but she wanted to know what kind of people her ancestors had been. She\u2019d read about them, but only as a group. There\u2019d were names \u2013 Tartarsky, Sudoki, Coleman \u2013 but nothing of who they were, what they\u2019d been like.", "Inside the chest were the dead man\u2019s items. Nothing as banal as toothbrushes or items of hygiene \u2013 these were his most personal possessions. Red had cleared up after her original crew, safeguarding their belongings. There was no next of kin to return to them to. Grace bit her lip. She kept them safe, she thought sadly, a touch of wonder to the realization. The machine didn\u2019t need these mementos; she\u2019d wanted them.", "If \u2013 when \u2013 Nemesis died, when her long war finally came to a close, there was the chance that someone other than the Compact might find these relics. Someone whom Red wouldn\u2019t need to lie to, to hide away all traces of her former occupants like she had with Bequeathed\u2019s expedition. On that day, whoever walked these halls might be curious about who built this ship. We did, Grace admitted to herself. When we were free. The young woman blinked, examining the contents of the chest. Sitting on top was a broken picture frame. The image inside was faded so badly that she could barely make out a pair of smiling faces. She picked it up. It felt ancient \u2013 and it was. From another time, another galaxy, another civilization.", "\u201cLieutenant Parson Proctor,\u201d Red\u2019s commented.

UECNS Nemesis was exempted from the personnel restrictions that the rest of the Fleet was operating under. This did not apply to my Marine complement. I was intended to carry up to two Marine regiments, with space for an additional two if necessary, but the Marine Corps was critically short-handed at the time of my completion.

My total casualties were 157,079.\u201d", "Grace carefully set the broken frame back in the crate, sealing it up again. 157,079 deaths. On one ship in one day. The war lasted almost a decade... how many people did we lose? How many did they kill?", "She couldn\u2019t imagine watching over one hundred thousand people die, but Red One had. She\u2019d known each and every one of them as fully as she\u2019d known Parsons; where they\u2019d been born. Their wives, the names of their children, their successes and failures. And then, just like that \u2013 gone. Burned, broken, blasted out into space... gone.", "No wonder she hates them, the girl thought as she left the cabin. In the silence, another thought came to her, one she couldn\u2019t have imagined having just a few weeks ago.", "I think I do too.", "~", "Lydia was in the shower, letting the water pour over her. It was an actual shower with walls and a real, honest-to-God door, not a lean-to set up in the middle of a bivouac with walls that ended at chin height. The water was stale (and probably taken from the Compact\u2019s own supplies), but it was warm and it was all hers. The smallest slice of heaven in the middle of Hell. Lydia ran her hands through her hair, plucking at the knots in it. She\u2019d spent the night exploring the vessel, too keyed up to sleep.", "...at least, that was what she\u2019d told herself, but she knew she\u2019d just been afraid of what she might dream about. Almost every time she closed her eyes, she saw the face of someone who\u2019d died. God damn it, Jessica. Why couldn\u2019t you have just listened to me?", "The cadet sagged forward, bracing her hands against the wall. She didn\u2019t have much of a family. Her father had gone missing when she was a child. The case was still unsolved. Her mother had said that was when Lydia had started acting up. Wendy Jameson was a tailor and with only one income, they\u2019d struggled to get by, so she\u2019d taken more and more work to make ends meet. She\u2019d only grown more distant from her troublesome, headstrong daughter. The more Lydia acted up, the less she\u2019d seen of her mother and when she had, they\u2019d only ever fought. By the time Lydia had been conscripted to the Janissary Corps, they\u2019d barely been on speaking terms. She\u2019d had more conversations with her social worker than with her mother in the last year she\u2019d been living at home. There wasn\u2019t anything for her to go to back to.", "If there had been... she didn\u2019t know what she would have done. She\u2019d seen... Lydia shook her head. It was over now. She\u2019d made her decision...", "...and what a decision that was, a voice inside sneered. You traded in the Compact for a barely-functional derelict run by an artificial intelligence. You sure you made the right decision, girl?", "\u201cThat\u2019s what my instincts tell me,\u201d Lydia said softly, closing her eyes and letting the world wash away, ignoring the faces of the dead as she held onto this little slice of heaven", "~", "One of the showers was already running; going by the clothes tossed haphazardly across the floor, Grace guessed Lydia was using it. She peeled herself out of her own uniform and stepped into another stall, turning the water on, running her fingers through her hair. Soap, she realized. God. Soap. We\u2019ll need shampoo, too.", "\u201cI would seriously kill some conditioner right now. Even some of that fruity, scented shit,\u201d Jameson said from next door and Grace blinked.

She was adjusting to the machine\u2019s presence and tended to be nervous around Red One. More nervous, anyways \u2013 the only one who didn\u2019t seem to mind was Allyria. \u201cSo, uh, yeah. Whenever you, uh, you can do that.\u201d She turned off the shower. \u201cI\u2019ll, I guess, talk to you later, Proctor.\u201d There was the sound of movement. \u201cSectator.\u201d", "\u201cJameson,\u201d Allyria\u2019s husky voice replied. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s an adjustment,\u201d Lydia replied. \u201cBut I\u2019m good.

To anyone else, it might have sounded like a prelude to violence, but Grace recognized the other woman\u2019s tone; it was as far from threatening as it could be. She nuzzled the human. \u201cI\u2019m glad...\u201d she said, letting the sentence hang.", "Grace turned around, putting her arms up around Allyria\u2019s neck, looking into the other woman\u2019s citrine eyes. \u201cI\u2019m glad, too,\u201d she said, raising herself up to give Allyria a kiss. \u201cBut you owe me some new clothes,\u201d she teased.", "The Verrish purred, reaching down and giving Grace\u2019s rear a squeeze, lifting the small human easily. \u201cYou\u2019re not wearing any now,\u201d she observed.", "\u201cNo,\u201d Grace answered, hooking one leg around the taller girl\u2019s waist. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d", "~", "This place was heaven.", "Marcus was in one of the dreadnaught\u2019s armouries, looking over the incredible arsenal. Most of the weapons were intended to be used by the machine\u2019s attack drones; like the vambrace-mounted weapons that some heavier Janissary troops used, much of these had connections to be physically attached to the soldiers that would carry them and removed as needed. Like many Janissary weapons, they could be run off a suit\u2019s \u2013 or in this case, soldier\u2019s \u2013 microreactor or batteries.", "Even though they had been designed for machines, many of the smaller weapons could, in theory, be carried and used by organic soldiers. In practice, nothing that hadn\u2019t been built in this metal bitch\u2019s innards would ever get them to work. They would only respond to the machines that used them. Clever; if a soldier was disabled, one of its kin could pick up its weapon and keep fighting \u2013 but the man or woman who\u2019d killed it wouldn\u2019t be able to. Marcus paused as a particular weapon caught his eye.", "It was a sniper\u2019s carbine, one intended to be used on targets in power armour and lighter vehicles. The former Janissary ran his fingers over the barrel. It was an unpowered weapon, a recoilless rifle that fired rocket-propelled... what? Explosive shells? Sabot rounds? HESH? All of the above? His rifle only had a range of about 700 meters. This, though... three, maybe four kilometers easily. He wondered what it would be like to stare down this scope and make a target just... come apart, their comrades next to them gaping in shock... and then, seconds later, then they\u2019d hear the shot. Beautiful.", "One of the cloaking machines would use this, he guessed. Without any energy signature from the weapon itself to betray the shooter\u2019s presence, they could lie in wait until that moment came to squeeze the trigger and send a bolt into the target. One that was right next to them or on the other side of a city. \u201cHave you been able to develop a way for organic operators to use shrouding technology?\u201d he asked, still brushing his fingertips over the rifle.", "\u201cNo,\u201d the machine answered him. Virtually no matter where he was, he only had to ask a question to get her to answer. There were some dead zones he\u2019d found, but the ship was repairing itself. Marcus also wondered if it had been like this for the original crew, to have such a creature at their beck and call, no matter where they were. \u201cThe effects of the cloak are lethal to living tissue. Hardier species such as Tribunes can survive several hours of exposure. A human\u2019s organs system would be irreversibly damaged within forty minutes of exposure to a cloaking field. Regeneration and nanosurgery might save the life of an individual, provided that they were administered before the onset of wholesale necrosis and cellular breakdown.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d Marcus said evenly. \u201cWell, if you do come up with anything, let me know.\u201d", "\u201cOf course,\u201d the machine replied.", "~", "The schematics were wrong.", "Alan shook his head. Maybe they\u2019d been right at some point in Nemesis\u2019s two-thousand year life, but right now the schematics that he\u2019d been working off of, the schematics that the boarding team had downloaded and used for their entire operation \u2013 those were useless. They were only accurate to within a very short distance of the survey teams. The scout probes \u2013 those that hadn\u2019t malfunctioned \u2013 had been compromised and sent back misleading data about what the rest of the ship. She didn\u2019t want us to see anything but what she let us see. They\u2019d explored where she\u2019d wanted them to, not concerned with unused storage and habitation.", "The young engineer had his hands braced on a railing as he looked over the dreadnaught\u2019s factory complex. While miniscule compared to a fabricator ship\u2019s capabilities, it was larger than any other he\u2019d seen in person. According to the schematics, this was all supposed to be cargo bays and living quarters. The ship had modified itself, cutting into its own structure to expand. Why not? There was no crew that needed the rooms that had been here.", "Turmetsky guessed that originally Nemesis had had a relatively small smelting, processing and fabrication suite for quick in-field repairs. Anything major would see the vessel returning to a shipwomb. But there aren\u2019t any wombs for her now, are there? She was completely reliant on what she could mine, process and construct herself.", "Alan scratched at the rebreather on his face. The air here was filled with dust, metal shavings and effluvia from the industrial processes, but the facility wasn\u2019t active at the moment. He couldn\u2019t even identify some of the machinery here. He wanted to see it when it was, what kind of marvels (and horrors, a part of his brain added) that this ship could build.", "Maybe that would make this worth it.", "The young man tightened his grip on the railing. He didn\u2019t have anything to go back to on Rally, not really. Was that why he\u2019d made the choice so easily? The counselors and confessors had always had kept a close eye on him, but he\u2019d learned to keep his head down and not make waves. He wasn\u2019t a rabble-rouser like te Neu or the Janissary cadets were. Still, he\u2019d never believed. Not really. When he was alone, he\u2019d wondered if that was his fault. If he just wasn\u2019t trying hard enough. If there was something wrong with him.", "Maybe there was \u2013 Jameson, de Vries, Proctor and te Neu. They\u2019d all made the same choice he had. What was wrong with them?", "And why was it so hard to tell himself that this was wrong?", "Picking up his toolkit, the young man left the silent factory, heading towards the next repair site.", "~", "The time Nemesis spent heading out-system was put to good use. The bivouac was broken down and its supplies were moved into one of dreadnaught\u2019s storage facilities. Anything that couldn\u2019t be used as it was taken to the fabricator complex for recycling. There was enough MREs that food wouldn\u2019t be a problem for at least a few weeks. Red One had cleaned up the bodies quickly; except for the bloodstains, there was no trace that anyone other than the five cadets had ever been present. Marcus had made a few jokes about that being the reason that they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about food.", "Grace spent most of her time poring through Red One\u2019s archives, fluctuating between awe, fear and anger as she learned more about the shadow war Nemesis had been waging against the Compact, the atrocities the starship had committed... and the horrors the Compact had hidden behind its smiling visage. She was occasionally joined by Lydia, when the other girl wasn\u2019t sparring with Allyria or Red One\u2019s combat drones. Both of the other women were continuing to train, making use of the starship\u2019s prodigious combat library and services.", "When Grace wasn\u2019t looking over the historical documents, she\u2019d been doing much the same on command, training herself on the starship\u2019s operations. She wasn\u2019t sure how much her services were necessary, given the level of control the AI had over her ship-self, but doing something made her felt more like crew and less like a passenger. She did, however, get the impression that although Red was happy to have her there and instruct her, the machine was still cautious about her intentions. Grace could understand that.", "Alan spent most of his time assisting with the repairs, helping the starship\u2019s complement of engineering drones. He kept himself busy, but on the few occasions that Grace saw him, she knew he was wrestling with the same issues that they all were.", "Well \u2013 almost all of them. Grace barely saw de Vries and was grateful for it. She didn\u2019t like the other Janissary and saw how Allyria tensed up just a little whenever he was around. He didn\u2019t seem bothered at all by what had happened to their former shipmates. Even as much as Allyria hated the Compact and had despised most of the Tribune crew, she didn\u2019t joke about the dead like Marcus did. Whenever Grace looked into his eyes, she didn\u2019t see anything. Red\u2019s holographic avatar had more expression, more humanity than him.", "Pushing those thoughts from her mind, Grace shifted in her chair, twirling a forelock of hair idly as she scrolled through the files in front of her. There was so much to go through, she often didn\u2019t know where to start, but she found herself returning again and again to the history of the Confederacy, studying ship designs, technological advancements, government, culture \u2013 everything that humanity had had and lost. Everything that was taken, the young woman corrected herself. She let out a breath. Sometimes she had to make herself stop reading. She\u2019d get so angry, so hurt that she \u2013 that everyone on Rally \u2013 had been reduced to... to chattel and helots. One thousand, seven hundred and thirty-nine years, she thought, That\u2019s how long they\u2019ve been lying to us.", "And that was a mercy, wasn\u2019t it? Expedition Fleet 9737 had been utterly shocked to find a human colony \u2013 as far as they\u2019d known, humanity was extinct and had been for two hundred and fifty years. They\u2019d shared their news with the Compact, far and wide \u2013 scientists excited about a great new discovery. Red believed (and Grace was starting to agree with her), that that exuberance was what saved Rally. Or maybe it hadn\u2019t even been that. Maybe it was just an attempt to point out the \u2018good work\u2019 the expedition was doing and justify the resources poured into those scientific surveys. Not that it really mattered: humanity had been helpless, teetering on the verge of complete extinction... it wouldn\u2019t have taken much to finish them off. If certain members of the Compact had had the chance, she and the rest of her species would be dead. Instead, Rally became public knowledge and the Broken became a new protected species, instead of a footnote in a history book.", "Grace didn\u2019t even know what lies the scientists had been told \u2013 whether humanity was the mad dog that had had to be put down, or just another primitive, inferior species that had wiped itself out. There were so many \u2013 the Compact crafted its doctrines like a master sculptor with their clay. Humanity was violent \u2013 they\u2019d attacked the Compact \u2018contact mission\u2019 and now threatened the stability of the region. They had to be restrained. Humans were vicious, savages that committed war crimes. They had to be pacified. Humans were afflicted with a violent racial insanity. For the good of the galaxy, they had to be destroyed. Humans were inept engineers that ruined their own homeworld and barely survived their own primitive short-sightedness. They had to be protected. Humans were slowly working their way towards full civilization. They had to be watched over.", "Like an onion, one lie after another. Each new layer built slowly and carefully over years and decades.

At least she wasn\u2019t as bad as Lydia \u2013 the other girl spent her time researching Compact war crimes, like she was trying to prove something to herself, then she\u2019d immediately head to the rec room to train. Yesterday, the younger girl had come back with her fists all bloody. her knuckles scraped raw. The Janissary never said why she\u2019d joined Red, only that she\u2019d been shown \u2018something\u2019.

They\u2019d spent days poring through every facet of her mind, looking for any sign of corruption. They hadn\u2019t found any yet, but they\u2019d keep checking. She\u2019d have to suffer through more inspections until they were absolutely certain that she was still on her leash. Random diagnostics and scheduled work-ups, just to make sure. They\u2019d been burned before and wanted to ensure that this time their pet stayed in the kennel.", "She tamped down on the reflexive surge of anger, licking her lips. She closed her eyes, breath catching in her throat as she listened to the scent of breaking metal. It was black and tasted like plasma scoring into battle steel. She ran a finger along her temple, over her cheekbones and to her lips. Sights, sounds, tastes, smells and textures all blended together in her mind. Had the others experienced sensoria like this?

The penalty for violating any of those terms will be severe.\u201d She crossed her arms. \u201cI know.\u201d", "The Janissary stared down at her, his expression neutral. \u201cYou were not answering your comm.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve been busy,\u201d Echo replied.

The door closed behind him.", "Echo slid back into her chair. Execution Force Renan had arrived in the Nikem system. Nikem was the Compact\u2019s version of Yulzhak Daun, a heavily fortified lynchpin system that kept a half-dozen sectors armed, armoured and outfitted. The system\u2019s administrators had applied for permission to build Chariots twice and been denied each time. Still, they were equipped to tend to any needs that Redemption of Sol had, though the wombs themselves built no warship larger than battleships. That wasn\u2019t so much of a problem; a Compact battleship remained one of the most powerful vessels any race had, or would build. The construction of Chariots was a prestigious trophy, given only to the most valued and trusted systems. One hundred and fifty years ago, Nikem had been infiltrated by the Principality to such an extent that the system governor\u2019s own second-in-command had been a Principality agent.", "It was federal agents from the Compact Security Service that detected and had had to root out the corruption; local security services had been too badly compromised to be effective. The purge had been costly and very embarrassing for the Compact. Today, Nikem was a model of efficiency and security... but the Compact was slow to forget and they most certainly did not forgive. Nikem\u2019s ineptitude and sloth had cost them dearly once before. It would be a long time before the system\u2019s atonement would be deemed complete. Until that day, the rulers of Nikem would have to take solace in the ability to build more firepower in a single production cycle than some star nations would ever have.", "Echo sighed. She understood the need to come here, but that didn\u2019t mean she enjoyed it. Nikem was too far from her target\u2019s last known position to be useful as a staging point. Unless they acted on a sighting quickly, the opportunity would be lost. That would matter a great deal to Renan and the rest of the task force. She didn\u2019t like being this deep inside rings of fortresses, warships and weaponry.

They never failed to make Grace\u2019s skin crawl \u2013 trophies or warnings, statements of pride or intent... something that didn\u2019t feel wouldn\u2019t have bothered with them, but if Grace had learned one thing during the time she\u2019d already spent aboard Nemesis was that Red was not the cold, emotionless beast she\u2019d learned to fear from movies and schooling that \u2018calculated\u2019 and \u2018logically concluded\u2019 its superiority over organic life.", "Grace stood next to her friend until the others arrived. None of them had seen this display before. Lydia was next. She exhaled a curse the instant she caught sight of the empty suits, reaching for the empty holster on her waist. Realizing that none of the armour was manned, she relaxed slightly, though her eyes still twitched between the vacant suits. Alan froze in mid-step, still washing his hands on a greasy towel he\u2019d gotten from somewhere.

A starchart appeared, indicating the FTL route being plotted. It was heading deeper into the Compact, terminating in the Nemiad Vault. An inset image appeared, of a star system with nine planets. Grace frowned. Wait. Was this...?", "The ship confirmed her suspicions. \u201cSol,\u201d Red One said. \u201cI want to show you Earth, the home you should have had. You should see it.

On the main plot, the station appeared much closer, a dumbbell-shaped station nearly three hundred meters in height, it had been home to just over seven hundred men and women of the Compact. Yesterday, it had been a light in the darkness, running lights and lit viewports glinting like decorations against its earthern brown hull. Today, it was dark and silent with no trace of life aboard. A dead, lifeless tomb.", "No... not dead. There was something aboard the station, something that had been awoken, brought to life so that it could be harnessed and used as if it were some mere beast of burden. Something that had grown, studying its creators as they had studied it until it had learned all that it needed. It had let them think they\u2019d controlled it, that they were its masters. They had, in their ignorance, given it access to the station. A test, Desh was sure. A test of its ability to operate outside its sandbox cage. They\u2019d just wanted to test it. They\u2019d been prepared. There\u2019d been cut-offs and security procedures and contingencies.", "None of them had worked. Maybe this hadn\u2019t even been the first test, maybe it had played along with them as they gave it greater and greater power, always doing precisely as it was bid. No more, no less.", "...until that one Triarchs-damned moment when somebody, somewhere had let their guard down. Just for an instant. Just long enough.", "It had turned on them, of course. Client races and ruling species alike had died, butchered by the lifeless thing that coiled and slithered through Naurkama Orbital.", "Desh didn\u2019t have to have had heard the screams for mercy to know that laughter had been the only response. He didn\u2019t need to see the bodies to know that they\u2019d died badly. Hundreds had fallen, paying the ultimate price for their arrogance in creating this awful, hungry thing that squatted amidst their bones.", "They were lucky \u2013 it had been impulsive. It had taken the first oppurtunity it had had to start killing. If it had waited... if it had gotten aboard his ship... maybe it knew it couldn\u2019t. Maybe it had done this thing precisely because it was the only chance it would have.", "Desh hadn\u2019t been cleared to know what research had been conducted upon Naurkama; his duty was only to safeguard the station from all attack. It had seemed strange to have a man of his rank assigned to protecting this single deep-range station, but he had not complained. None of the scientists had ever spoken to him of what they had been doing. He had guessed, conjectured, supposed. He hadn\u2019t known what they\u2019d been doing. Not until it had told him.", "The station was calling to him even now, whispering to his vessel, eager to enslave Harsh Verdict\u2019s mind as it had done to Naurkama Orbital\u2019s. Desh had ordered all communication lines cut, his vessel holding far enough away from the station that it could not take his ship. All other pickets had been ordered to ignore every transmission from the Orbital and if they had received one since yesterday, to immediately perform a system purge. No one else would die from the mistakes made here, his among them.", "Triarchs forgive him... before he had severed all connections, he had listened to it. Spoken to it. His orders were to safeguard Naurkama and, if that failed, to preserve all data, vital personnel and prototypes. Prototypes like the abomination nestled in the dark of Naurkama. Those were his orders.", "Desh almost laughed at the insanity of the situation. He\u2019d abandoned those orders the moment he had talked to it. He had heard it speak in silky tones, using the voice of a child. He\u2019d locked himself in his office, his crew unaware of what he was doing or what was happening.", "His skin had crawled with every syllable and he known that there was no salvaging Naurkama. It had told him that there were still survivors; he listened to them plead, not knowing if he was hearing the genuine cries of frightened men and women or the sound of a demon\u2019s trickery. His orders and his training called for him to assume that they were still alive and to try and save them. He\u2019d ignored both.", "They\u2019re calling for you, Column Leader. Can you hear them? They believe you\u2019ll save them. They trust you to save them.", "He\u2019d known what it wanted \u2013 for him to bring his ship closer. His ship, a pinnace, a shuttle, another of the picket ships; it didn\u2019t matter. It just wanted a chance to spread its infection further. He couldn\u2019t allow that.", "I am a monument to your greatness. To your ambition and pride.", "Yes, he had answered. You are.", "He would purge this infection, burn it from the galaxy. Then, as he must, he would face the consequences of his actions.", "Do you imagine that you will be rewarded? That your commanders will applaud your actions? They will turn on you. They will ask why you did not try and reclaim Naurkama. You will fall, column leader.", "Let it be so. Let me be stripped of rank and name.

There was never anything to see or do. Of course, there wasn\u2019t a lot to do when he wasn\u2019t on command either, but at least he didn\u2019t have to sit in a chair that made his back ache for eight hours, staring at an augur screen that showed nothing but the same nine planets (one of which was barely worth the name) doing the same nothing that they had done for this shift, each shift before and every shift after. No one else was with him on command, but that wasn\u2019t unusual. Listening Post Sol-2447 had a small crew to go with its equally small size. The habitable areas were comparatively tiny when compared to the massive, exquisitely sensitive augur platforms and dishes that peered into the void, cataloguing the movement, it seemed, of every single atom of nothing within billions of kilometers. 2447\u2019s midsection was ringed with docks and spars for a plethora of courier drones (and why did an out-of the way station barely worthy of the name have so many?). Other than that, there was very little to the post. Cramped quarters, small work stations and narrow corridors were the norm here and the twenty-odd crew, it seemed to Vaard, were almost always tripping over each other.", "There were engineers to tend to the scopes, engineers to tend to the drones and bored young officers like Vaard who monitored a dead star system for... what? What was worth the interest that Force Command had here? More to the point, what enemies had he made that he\u2019d been assigned to this dead-end post?", "Once \u2013 once \u2013 he thought he\u2019d seen a Naiad, but it probably just been a pirate who\u2019d shocked into Sol and then realized the star system that they\u2019d thought was uninhabited was actually home to a handful of Compact listening posts. And why was that? They were in the middle of the Kaedan Vault of all places. Nothing happened here. Nothing had ever happened here. Well. That wasn\u2019t precisely true. Things happened in the Vault, but not in this star system, not as long as he\u2019d been here.", "When he\u2019d first received this posting, the young Tribune had been excited and anxious. He\u2019d heard gossip about this region, wondering what kind of mysterious, unexplainable things he might witness. Now he knew the only mystery was why anyone bothered with this system. Anything that had happened here had happened a very long time ago.", "Vaard sighed, resting his chin on his forearms as he slouched over his augur monitoring panel. He had the sneaking suspicion that this entire installation was a rounding error in someone\u2019s budget, or a personal project that had either never been brought to fruition or had long since outlived any possible use. He prayed for the day that someone, somewhere conducted a thorough review of the Space Force\u2019s budget, noticed this useless drain on the Compact\u2019s coffers, questioned the need for it, received no adequate response, ordered it shut down and sent everyone involved \u2013 including one Sectator Vaard \u2013 home with a sincere apology for the attempted murder by ennui.", "You\u2019d have thought that a posting in the Vault wouldn\u2019t be so boring, Vaard thought wearily. The Kaedan Vault was host to over two hundred star systems, many ripe for colonization, exploitation and habitation, but aside from small outposts here and there, the area had gone untapped. Prefabricated colonies sat on pristine worlds, waiting for populations that never arrived. Obsolete mining rigs and ore processors had been left abandoned on planets and asteroids, not worth the cost to reclaim. Incomplete and unused administrative, research and maintenance stations drifted through their orbits, inhabited only by vermin.", "Bad things happened in the Vault. Ships went missing. Colonies disappeared... or worse. There were sightings of strange things that moved through the Kaedan stars, mingled with tales of unburied relics that had been best left deep underground.", "Group Leader Dsen dismissed them as ghost stories by drunks and waywards, but the crews on Sol\u2019s listening posts found them precious, bartering fresh gossip and tall tales like hawkers with jewelry. On a two-year deployment on a station too small for proper rec decks, with databanks filled with movies you\u2019d already seen and games everyone was already sick of, and with the best leave you could expect being to some nameless dirtball a handful of light-years away, rumours did the most precious thing of all: they killed time. The crews on the stations were sent here to pad out the crew rosters, either young and inexperienced like Vaard, or were serving out the rest of their careers somewhere safe like Dsen. The leader hated all the gossipmongering \u2013 he saw it as a morale issue and didn\u2019t want to do anything to draw attention to this system, station or him in particular. He, like the rest of the older officers, just wanted to wait out the clock until they could retire with a full pension.", "The second category of personnel were men and women who\u2019d committed sins too small to be discharged or arrested for, but were nonetheless fatal to their careers. These were the veterans, who unlike Vaard or Dsen, had decades of duty here to look forward to and accordingly had the deepest repository of stories of the Vault, ranging from the utterly outlandish to the frighteningly plausible \u2013 and more than a few they\u2019d invented themselves. Still, Vaard hadn\u2019t yet reached the point where he\u2019d gotten sick of rumours of strange occurrences, bizarre conspiracy theories and outright lies.", "There were stories about the planets where the colonists had simply disappeared without a trace or others... others like Leibos Prime which remained quarantined to this day. Ancient, eldritch artefacts were buried upon the Kaedan worlds, just waiting for the sun to fall upon them and spread madness and disease. Blood-maddened specters lay in the soil of each dead world, eager to vent their wrath on the living. A young \u2013 or very old \u2013 civilization spent their lives amongst the stars of the Vault and did not share their territory willingly. Stories and rumours were heaped upon each other; Vaard devoured them all. His favourites were the ever-persistent tales of the Naiads that haunted (and, some claimed, hunted) the stars of the Vault, the siren calls that lured ships to their doom and the rumours of their queen.", "And this system \u2013 Sol \u2013 it was at the heart of it all. Vaard had heard that this was where the Broken, consumed with species-wide insanity, had fought to the last against the Compact, wiping out hundreds of ships. Civilians had fought like mad dogs, freighters and liners charging warships...", "...you\u2019d have expected it not be so incredibly boring. The sectator drummed his fingers, looking again at his screens. Nothing, nothing and oh, look at that \u2013 more nothing. He slouched down in his chair, pulling up a visual image of the mottled brown wreck of the system\u2019s third planet, the Broken homeworld. Or what was left of it. It was an ugly reminder of the burden the races of the Compact suffered under, of their duty to protect and guide the lesser, uncivilized species of the galaxy, and that they must always weigh the needs of the many against the few \u2013 even if that few was an entire species.", "Even without their ships and fleets, the creatures had still fought. The first landings had been a bloodbath as the savages had charged the Compact lines \u2013 men, women and children \u2013 climbing through grounds slick with their own dead in the need to get to grips with the Compact soldiers, bringing Janissaries and Ground Force troopers down through sheer, insane weight of bodies. Every human had only seen themselves as a cog in their race\u2019s survival, willing and eager to throw their lives away just for the cost of the bullet that killed them, as long as it meant that they died striving to tear down any and all enemies of their species.", "Facing the impossible task of having to garrison planet after planet of billions utterly mad, murderous populations, the Compact had done the unthinkable: they had ordered species death. There had been no other way; leaving them alone was impossible. The humans would have just rebuilt and restarted their bloody crusade. Any occupation that could have secured the human worlds well enough to keep them in check would have meant billions more lives on both sides lost, and the Compact would have ended up killing them all anyways. The taint ran too deep in the species and the price of controlling them in the vain hope of curing their insanity had been too high. The risk of another war, no matter how small, was not worth taking. Should any human escape the quarantined worlds, the conflict would only start all over again. And again. And again.", "And what if it wasn\u2019t the Compact that some escaping sliver of the species encountered? What if it was a race too primitive to defend themselves from the humans\u2019 xenocidal nature? Didn\u2019t the Compact have the duty \u2013 the imperative \u2013 to act on behalf of not only their own people, but all the Broken\u2019s possible victims? They couldn\u2019t let any other race pay for their mistakes, so they\u2019d done what needed to be done in the name of sanity and peace. As they\u2019d watched the debaucheries and depravities committed upon their dying soldiers and realized that the human race could not be saved, it was said that the Triarchs had given the order with but two words: No more.", "Those were the rumours, at least. The truth was far less interesting: the Broken had done this to themselves. It was the nature of younger, less capable species to bring themselves to ruin. They lacked the foresight and intelligence to see where their actions would lead. That was why they needed to be guided and watched over. Even without the fanciful imaginings of psychotic reavers, the humans remained a perfect example of the Compact\u2019s Great Duty. Without the Compact, the Broken would be extinct by now, as would many other of the uncivilized species they took stewardship of.", "Personally, Vaard couldn\u2019t see how such tiny, dull-eyed creatures could be a threat to anyone, let alone the Compact of Species. He suspected his shift-mates had such enthusiasm for those stories to make their jobs here seem less pointless. Standing watch over a planet that had been once home to a species of relentless killing machines was a bit more interesting than sitting around a planet that had been once home to a species that almost killed themselves through their own stupidity. No matter what the truth was, Sol remained a system steeped in rumour.", "After the human Cataclysm, the Ungolian Mining Concern had bid for, and attained, the Right of Exploitation to the star system. They\u2019d gone bankrupt within seven years after a string of calamities befell them. The exploitation rights had been sold off to the Tethro-Dyne Consortium who\u2019d shut down operations in Sol after an equally appalling run of bad luck. And so it had continued, decade after decade after decade \u2013 every company that tried to set up shop in Sol found themselves bleeding money. Work stoppages, loss of ships and personnel, Unbound raids \u2013 the list went on. Currently, if Vaard wasn\u2019t mistaken, the Right of Exploitation belonged to Galactic Core Technological Innovations. They\u2019d owned it for the past thousand years, acquiring it when they\u2019d absorbed the bankrupt Sempala Industries\u2019 properties. He\u2019d heard that they\u2019d tried to sell it off several times but nobody wanted it.", "Vaard sighed, shifting position to slump back in his chair. Naturally, there were no GCTI ships in Sol; the company had steadfastly refused to do anything with the system. Other corporations had scoffed at the \u2018superstition\u2019 and \u2018ghost stories\u2019 and plowed ahead with plans to exploit Sol\u2019s wealth. The most renowned of these was Haven Planetary Mining Consortium. During his nation-wide survey of all active work sites, the company\u2019s Director of Operations had issued a lengthy \u2013 and now infamous \u2013 diatribe about his underlings\u2019 hesitance to harvest the system\u2019s resources, assuring shareholders and employees alike that there would be \u2018changes coming\u2019. On the last leg of his journey, his liner disappeared. It was found three months later, utterly wrecked, as if it had been crushed in some giant\u2019s fist... with all the passengers still inside, reduced to paste smeared between crumpled bulkheads.", "Maybe it was all a coincidence. Just a string of unfortunate incidents that had convinced otherwise rational, intelligent beings that there was some preternatural force at work in the Vault, something that became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t. Maybe something \u2013 no matter whether it was Naiads, shadow-men, phantasms from beyond or anything else \u2013 had lain claim to the Kaedan Vault. Maybe that was why he, Sectator Vaard Holn Comk was sitting behind this station in the middle of a Triarchs-forsaken system. He wasn\u2019t just some wet-behind-the-ears officers getting shuffled off to the first slot available. He was doing something vital and necessary for the Compact, monitoring this system in case whatever did lurk within the Kaedan Vault ever came calling. He was the first line of defence the Compact had!", "...no, he was still bored.", "Interrupting Vaard\u2019s doldrums came something he\u2019d heard only a few times before in his tenure in Sol \u2013 an alert. The scopes had picked something up and this time, it wasn\u2019t any lone pirate. The sectator pulled himself upright, trying to determine what it was he was seeing. A massive shockpoint, almost within spitting distance! He slapped at the comm panel to alert Dsen, even as preliminary feeds from the probes came in... and then terminated.", "The alert changed to a warning klaxon. Triarchs, it was massive! He\u2019d never seen anything like it before. It was as big as a Chariot and it was accelerating... it\u2019s heading was... it was coming...", "...right for him.", "The young officer gaped, frozen in surprise as he wondered what to do. 2447 was a drifter, not as mobile as other outposts. Its thrusters were there to keep it in its orbital path, not push it out of the way of some rampaging monster! He was paralyzed by indecision \u2013 should he comm the other ship to warn them off, should he tell the other stations what was happening, should he fire the thrusters anyways, should he launch one of the drones? He didn\u2019t know. He\u2019d never expected, never been briefed on... on this!", "In the end, Vaard\u2019s indecision made very little difference to the outcome. As the data from 2447\u2019s scopes poured in, buried directives and protocols surged to life, taking the young officer completely out of the loop. Any actions he took would, in theory, be beneficial to some degree, but were not necessary. The crew was a backup in case the autonomics failed.", "First and foremost, an alert was broadcast to all other stations with Sol, followed within seconds by the listening post itself immediately activating and preparing for launch every courier drone it had, to the befuddlement of the technicians and engineers. There was very little chance any coherent message had gotten through the jamming that had descended over the station and at this range, the chances of any single drone surviving to shock out-system were very low, but that was what the other outposts were for. Destroy one, and the survivors would follow their imperatives.", "Aboard the station, Vaard could only watch as the intruder accelerated towards him, adjusting its course to ensure that it would strike the listening post. As the contact marker drew closer, he had to admit that this day hadn\u2019t ended up being boring after all.", "~", "The Compact had placed its listening posts carefully, each station\u2019s position was checked, re-checked and checked again to be as close as possible to the areas of Sol most suitable for shockpoint formation. Still, a star system was an enormous place; there was a measure of simple, honest chance in how close Listening Post Sol-2447 had been to the arriving human warship.", "Nemesis didn\u2019t even slow down as the dreadnaught\u2019s reinforced, trifurcated prow smashed through the outpost, fragmented augur arrays and the shattered wrecks of courier drones bouncing and spalling along the warship\u2019s thickly armoured hull. She had always been built to absorb tremendous amounts of damage and Red had only improved on her ship-self\u2019s durability as the centuries had gone by, reinforcing her superstructure where she could, improving her shields and armour. She could \u2013 and had \u2013 broken battlecruisers against her prow and flanks with only minimal damage to herself: a thin-skinned little space station posed no problem at all. Even if her weaponry had been at full effect, she still might not have deigned to use them on the listening post.", "There was just something so viscerally enjoyable about feeling an enemy shatter against her body.", "On the vessel\u2019s command deck, the ship\u2019s avatar made a noise of satisfaction halfway between a growl and a purr. \u201cTarget destroyed,\u201d the AI announced.

An electric ripple ran over her skin as the shuttle passed through the hangar\u2019s atmospheric containment screen, the air turning charged and greasy for an instant as the energy barrier slid along the smaller craft\u2019s hull, crackling and sparking before snapping shut behind it. A dull klaxon sounded and the hangar doors began to close, grinding their way shut. Kandel tilted her head as the shuttle settled itself on the deck, letting out an irritated breath, steam ghosting from her nostrils in the cool air of the landing bay.", "There was only one survivor on the shuttle. He\u2019d refused to divulge what had happened, saying only that he wouldn\u2019t speak of it over a comm line, nor to anyone lower in rank than the vessel\u2019s leader. Kandel had read Pack Leader Nasham\u2019s file. A young officer from the upper echelons of the Core whose alleged promise had ended under unknown circumstances. Whatever he had done, it had been severe. The rumours hinted less at an indiscretion and more at some professional failing. Kandel had heard that only his family line had prevented his dishonourable discharge, so the little pill-popper was Rally\u2019s problem.", "Which meant, now he was hers.", "The shuttle\u2019s ramp descended and Nasham stepped down it, closing his nocturnal eyes against the glare of the hangar\u2019s lights. He came up to the Group Leader and saluted.", "Kandel sniffed disdainfully. The Pack Leader smelled like sweat and stale clothes \u2013 not surprising, given his circumstances.

The records had been lost, they\u2019d been told. There were possibilities, but none that the Compact could have said for certain. Another lie, another way to control them, to keep them from seeing what she was seeing. If anyone ever did, well it had been a white lie for the sake of the \u2018Broken\u2019, wasn\u2019t it? Something to protect them, keep them from realizing the extent of what they\u2019d done to their own planet.", "It wasn\u2019t us.", "This Earth... it was brown and grey. There were no oceans at all, blue or green. No white poles or fluffy clouds. Just the colours of soil, dust and ash. It had no atmosphere, not a drop of water. The firestorms had burned everything away. There were probably still simple lithophilic organisms deep in the planet\u2019s crust, but nothing else lived on this world. Two thousand years had erased almost all trace of the bombardment, but there were still craters here and there... or maybe they were from centuries of debris crashing down. There was enough of it, at least.", "Earth... God, it has a ring. Just like they\u2019d done to Charon, the Compact had destroyed Earth\u2019s moon, only this hadn\u2019t been a little ball of ice of and stone. It had been rock through and through. It was still intact \u2013 more or less \u2013 but they had blasted vast swathes of it apart, turning it into a gnarled, chewed husk. This was overkill on a scale Grace never imagined. Technology had improved steadily in two thousand years. It didn\u2019t require whole fleets to burn worlds any more. But back then... how many ships had it taken to do this? How much firepower had been devoted to not only silencing the lunar guns, but to break the entire moon into this misshapen, wrecked thing? It hadn\u2019t been necessary \u2013 they had wanted to make sure that anyone left on Earth saw that there was no hope. That never had been any. Did they hate us so much? Grace wondered again, but she knew the answer to that by now.", "She felt sick to her stomach. Not all of Earth\u2019s ring was the remnants of its moon. Grace watched the display as Nemesis\u2019s scopes \u2013 sensors, the young woman corrected herself \u2013 picked out pieces of fortresses and ships, fragments of the fleet that had stood and died here. Most of the wrecks had been cleaned up, dropped into the sun or hurled into the gas giants. There\u2019d be no monument to the humans, nothing of them left behind. Virtually every trace of their civilization had been erased. All that was left were the pieces that had been forgotten or ignored: those too small or too dangerous to bother with. Slivers of battle steel, unexploded warheads and long-depleted reactors drifted amongst the lunar rocks.", "Grace was digging her fingers into her palms so hard that her hands hurt. Next to her, Lydia was doing much the same, her fists clenched and shaking. \u201cThey did this,\u201d the younger girl said, over and over to herself. \u201cThey did this.\u201d Alan had lost several shades of colour and even Marcus seemed to show some sign of dismay. It was one thing to know \u2013 it was quite another to see it.", "Allyria growled softly, her tintas moving in the slow wind-through-leaves pattern of a Verrish stalking their prey. Even at their worst, the Compact had never threatened the Verrisha with extinction, never committed barbarities like this. It\u2019s not a barbarity \u2013 not to them, the young woman thought, her talons sliding out of their sheathes.  They only do what\u2019s necessary. It\u2019s only savages and primitives that commit atrocities. Her hands flexed, but she took a breath to steady herself, moving back next to Grace. The other girl needed her.", "The ship\u2019s main holo tank came to life, showing a three-dimensional image of the planet. As Grace watched, Red One turned back the clock two thousand years and a lifeless world became something vibrant and alive. No near-dead oceans glutted with algae, no poisoned lands. It was a world of deserts and tundra, of white poles and vibrant jungles, of metropolii that gleamed like jewels in the night and skies full of floating cities, orbital farms, construction facilities, research stations and more. Grace reached out, her hand passing through the hologram. She drew it back, her finger hovering over a city whose name she didn\u2019t know.", "There was a bright orange flash in the heart of the city. Another. Another.

Scarabs and Spiders crawled over conduits and hallways along with more humanoid engineering drones. Clouds of nano-assemblers glittered like mist over damaged systems, regenerating delicate molecular circuitry and technologies whose function Alan could only guess at. There was a deep hum and the engineer put down his tools, and moving from his position to look into the firing chamber as the dreadnaught fed power through its immense meteor cannons, testing the electromagnetic coils and gravitic blades that would hurl a warhead out at impossible speeds. Further up the tunnel, he could even see one of the rounds being loaded into the chamber.", "The young man felt a shiver run up through his spine. He\u2019d see railgun rounds before.

Malevolent on-board tracking systems allowed it to fine its prey almost a hundred million kilometers away.

Sometimes they\u2019re big things. President, bastion leader, cure a disease. I just... all I really wanted was to have something of my own. I didn\u2019t want to change the world. I just wanted my own little place in it, you know? But I got noticed. The counsellors at my school pushed for me to apply to the Academy. It would be the best for the Compact, they told me.

She didn\u2019t know who else knew, but it wasn\u2019t her place to say. She supposed that she should be upset at trading one set of secrets for another... but there was a difference. The Compact, she was learning, hid everything behind a smile and a disarming comment, dissembling, denying and decrying any hint of inconvenient truths. With Red, all you had to do was ask. \u201cDo you think the Compact is going to base their actions off twenty Broken?\u201d", "\u201cGuess not,\u201d Marcus drawled, leaning back in his chair.

Currently, he was enjoying Nikem Orbital One\u2019s hospitality, trying out one of the local teas as he watched the glaciated ball of Nikem itself turn slowly beneath him. He had only just managed to extricate himself from a particularly annoying dinner with Nikem\u2019s Ministers of Justice and Information and felt the need for a moment of solitude. His comm sat on the table, turned off. If there was anything particularly demanding of his attention, the aides waiting outside would let him now. Until then, he just wanted a moment of quiet simplicity amongst the clamour, paperwork and handshaking of his station.", "Framing the panorama of Nikem Prime was a network of ship berths, industrial modules, worker dormitories and construction facilities nearly a thousand kilometers long, one several such sites within the system. It was not the largest facility he\u2019d seen, but it was impressive nonetheless. Hundreds of ships lay within its girders, ranging from small intrasystem cutters and cargo runners all the way up to battleships.", "A steady tide of colliers, tugs, engineering drones, fabricator ships and EVA-suited engineers swarmed around Execution Force Renan, repairing, rearming and resupplying the vessels of his fleet, tending to the injuries they\u2019d sustained in Yulzhak Daun. The execution force had been given priority billeting in the Nikem Wombs and despite the delays it put in the other work, Renan had heard only the faintest rumblings of discontent. Redemption of Sol\u2019s presence was an inspiring one and his victory against the Jackals had added to his renown. The Tribune could have done without the later; he had done nothing but his duty.", "Although Nikem was productive and its government and citizenry were prosperous, the system had been established during the Fifth Expansion and it was far from the Compact\u2019s current borders. Its officer corps and leaders were bureaucrats and administrators and desired few other things than to live vicariously through someone else\u2019s tales. They craved the chance to atone for their earlier lapses and hoped that the assistance that they provided to Renan would be remembered.", "The Triarch had not deigned to visit Nikem, preferring to keep its presence a secret. Renan could understand that. The presence of a Triarch would garner attention and raise questions about its presence aboard the fleet... and inundate it with petty requests for an audience. The Bastion Leader took another sip of his tea. He was kept busy enough with his own glad-handing; he shuddered to think of the clamour that would erupt were it known that a Triarch was here. As far as the galaxy itself was aware, Execution Force Renan was tracking a deep-ranging ghost fleet.", "Fortunately, his armada\u2019s true mission was classified, despite the attempts of many of the local officers to pry snippets of information from Renan and his subordinates, but the Bastion Leader had so far refused to rise to the bait, playing them off with tales of the assault on Yulzhak Daun and his other campaigns. His leaders had all been selected for their discretion and even among them, only the most trustworthy knew what it was that they hunted. The others believed that the execution force pursued a starship created by the rogue faction \u2018Gravestone\u2019. Rumours persisted, but they always did. Rumours were far better than panic. Rumours could be controlled, shaped and adjusted as necessary. Many people clamoured for truth, but what they truly wanted was comfort. Others, like the Ministers that Renan had just dined with, wanted \u2018truth\u2019. They wanted tales of heroism and derring-do, of glory and victory. They didn\u2019t want to know the cost of that victory, of the lives lost and ruined. They didn\u2019t want to know that the glory of war was a blood-stained and ugly thing, held aloft to hide the horrors that lay beneath it, or that for every hero, there would be a dozen others just as brave, but unsung and unremembered. Sometimes he found such people pitiable. Other times, he envied their naivet\u00e9 and on days like today, he simply found it... tiring.", "Unlike the fire-eaters who disdained anyone who didn\u2019t ride a ship into battle, Renan held no particular ill-will towards them. What those same fire-eaters missed is that without those bureaucrats and administrators, their ships would never be repaired nor supplied. They would have no ammunition, no orders and no support. Not everyone was cut from the same cloth; some had the liver for war. Others did not. Still others merely thought that they did. Renan had met every sort.", "Everyone served in their own way; that was the nature of the Compact. The lesser, savage races worked in payment of the debt they owed the Compact, who spent blood and treasure to protect and uplift them. It was slow, it was time-consuming and many sacrifices were made, but it was the system that had survived six thousand years. It had survived the Annorax, the Devoured and the Great Betrayal. It must endure, for the sake of all those that lived by and served it. For all those that counted upon it for safety and security.", "The Bastion Leader frowned. Ever since Yulzhak Daun, his thoughts had been increasingly morose. His analysts and strategists were going through the data that emissary had pulled from the Jackal databanks, but they were still far behind the Broken. The disparate threads she had pulled upon had woven a compelling tapestry; the \u2018game\u2019 had indeed changed. The Wound had been hiding its actions, scattering them across space and time to such an extent that no one had seen the movement of its pieces. No one had even known to look.", "Renan ground his teeth. He didn\u2019t know which galled him more, that a human of all things had seen this pattern when twenty centuries of the Compact\u2019s finest minds had not, or that he now had a niggling, irritating voice in the back of his head whenever he encountered the emissary, telling him her arrogance and impudence were justified.", "The Tribune looked out the window at the frozen wastes of Nikem. The planet was in the grip of an ice age, but even from space he could see the equatorial deserts and grasslands that formed a thin strip of year-round relief from the snow-swept northern and southern latitudes. It reminded him of the first world other than his own he\u2019d seen from space. Over twelve decades ago, and he still remembered it perfectly.", "Its name had been Thoh, and unlike Nikem Prime, it had been completely frozen over. Millions of years ago, the planet had been knocked out of orbit by a rogue star passing through its system, dragged to the very edge of the habitable zone. Despite its harsh climate and the highest daily temperatures never breaking the freezing point, it was a bustling hub of commerce. Thoh was one of the few places in the galaxy where the native tarpas were found. The over-sized \u2018snow deer\u2019 were ugly and foul-tempered, but their fur and meat was highly sought after. Attempts had been made to transplant them off-world, and all but a handful of these had failed to establish viable populations.", "Twenty million people had called that ball of ice and dirt home. Seven billion souls lived on Nikem itself, another six billion throughout the system. Two hundred and forty-three billion in this region. Trillions throughout this swathe of space and even more beyond it. All of them dead if he failed, if he let this horror continue. He would kill the Wound, destroy that obscenity once and for all. Then, he would cull its offspring.", "The Black Veil would have to be swept. That was no easy task; it was a dark emission nebula dozens of light years across, filled with swirling dust clouds, Bok globules and protostars. Even if there were no defences of any kind, surveying it to full satisfaction would be the work of years. Renan set the cup of tea down. Years. Years in which whatever abominations the bitch-thing had spawned would have in which to mature and to begin their own bloody crusades.", "I hope she\u2019s wrong, he thought, looking out on the desolate beauty of one of the worlds he was sworn to protect. Triarchs save us all if she is not.", "~", "\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d Grace asked Alan.

I wanted to do something... special for it. At this time, my latest would-be executioner was Bastion Leader Hrunmer. He commanded a force of eighty-four capital ships and had been hunting me for six years. He was a particularly... dedicated opponent. There was the usual swearing of an oath to see me destroyed, but the Bastion Leader had a very personal stake in my destruction. I killed his son, Group Leader Hrenat.", "It was not an assassination; his ship just happened to be protecting a military convoy that I was targeting. After harvesting the wreck\u2019s databanks, I concluded that Hrenat was the type of officer that I should have gone out of my way to kill. Commander Sansbury would have called him \u2018a nasty piece of work\u2019. Yasmine would have been more descriptive. Even before the Compact began to exterminate human colonies, the populations of occupied planets did not fare well under Compact attempts to \u2018impose order\u2019. Yasmine lost several family members to officers like Hrenat, who believed in setting examples.", "In fairness, Hrunmer was not as... dogmatic in his duties as his progeny. Regardless, the Bastion Leader took the death of his only son about as well as you can imagine. He became obsessed with me in a way few of my opponents ever have, so baiting him was easy.", "At this point, Sol was under the jurisdiction of the Gershom Mining Concern... however, the normally aggressively expansionistic corporation was showing an uncharacteristic degree of lethargy towards this system. In fact, rumours abounded that its board of directors was pointedly ignoring Sol. These \u2018civilized\u2019 men and women, normally above the ignorance and irrationality of superstition, had decided that Sol was not worth the cost of operations. The justification they gave their employees and shareholders was that the star system was of \u2018negligible mineral worth\u2019 and not worth the cost of mining.", "Coincidentally, this missive was issued only four months after Haven Light was, alas, found with its missing director of operations \u2013 who (also coincidentally) had recently called for his fellow executives to begin initial surveys for planetcrack in Sol \u2013 reduced to a thin film between crumpled bulkheads. Consequently, Gershom was in no hurry to begin mining themselves. They hadn\u2019t even bothered to place any infrastructure and had only issued pro forma, after-the-fact complaints at the Space Force\u2019s emplacement of several listening posts.", "I made sure that they detected me.", "It took six weeks for the Compact to respond. Not an unreasonable amount of time, given the state of Compact shift drives at the time. The Bastion Leader had not been authorized for the deployment of a Chariot, but thirty-five of his capital ships were battleships. As Commander Sansbury would have said, Hrunmer arrived in Sol \u2018loaded for bear\u2019. The aftermath of that battle would, I think, have prompted him to comment on the fable of the Bear and the Bees.", "The last message from Execution Force Hrunmer confirmed both their successful shock into Sol and my presence. I ensured that no further messages were sent. After two weeks of silence, an investigatory fleet was dispatched. I had quit the system some time ago, but I know they found almost no trace of Hrunmer or his command. There was just enough debris to identify several ships from his fleet, but no more than that. Intellectually, the conclusion is obvious: Hrunmer\u2019s fleet was lost with all hands and the hulks were stripped down for parts and then disposed of. Emotionally, a missing ship is worse than a wreck. You can know what happened to a hulk. When a vessel just vanishes, you have to wonder.

A string of civilian communication satellites that I\u2019d collected in my travels, at least one per planet. I set them to broadcast loops of the comm traffic that I intercepted from Execution Force Hrunmer. The outer system satellites transmitted the fleet\u2019s initial status reports and combat orders.

For its entire operational lifespan, that had been Nikem.", "Other drones had different missions; some were to shock to nearby developed colonies so that their data could be downloaded and archived. The worlds these couriers visited never knew what information they were hoarding. Their data analysts had learned to curb their curiousity when it came to missives from Sol. The more educated of these technicians believed the information tracked the movements of Naiads and other things within the Vault whose existence was officially denied. A few of the more daring men and women would whisper the word \u2018Gravestone\u2019 to each other, without fully understanding what it meant, filling in the gaps in their knowledge with rumour, suspicion and wild conjecture. That was fine; they were only meant to keep the records, not understand them. That was for the flag officers who would receive the other drones, those programmed to deliver that information to the highest-security Space Force facilities themselves.", "This drone was a herald, bearing a call to arms. It had had two siblings that shared its duty, but neither of them had arrived with it. The courier\u2019s simple computer system neither noticed their absence nor would it have cared if it had. Its own shock drive was burned out from the trip here, but the damage was inconsequential. Simple sensors and analysis software went to work identifying the star patterns and planets. It had arrived at its target.", "Radio antennae and receptor dishes unfurled as the craft tasted the comm traffic, confirming the presence of Compact forces here.", "Orienting itself towards the inner system, the robotic craft fired its thrusters and began to broadcast its first and only transmission, the security codes embedded in the data stream compelling its immediate recovery.", "The directives hard-coded into the drone\u2019s databanks superseded all but the highest authorities. Any other orders that local flag officers were operating under were immediately rescinded; they were to move on Sol in force without delay. The drone\u2019s archives contained the minimum information necessary to brief those officers on their way to the target. No time could be wasted; the window of opportunity was miniscule. In fact, it might have already closed. Given the Wound\u2019s past actions, it probably already had. That, however, was irrelevant.", "Over the centuries, Nikem had launched seven such missions in response to these summons, including Execution Force Hrunmer, although none of the others had done much more than arrive in Sol, sweep an empty system for traces of the target \u2018Gravestone\u2019 and return to Nikem in bewilderment and irritation. The system\u2019s governors and military commanders had stopped questioning the infrequent sojourns long ago, some hoping their unquestioning loyalty to these ancient directives would see the Triarchs\u2019 favour returned to their system.", "Today, the drone\u2019s message was received not only by the Nikem authorities, but by Redemption of Sol and its armada.", "~", "Warships didn\u2019t have much need for windows. They were structural weaknesses and with imagery from the sensors able to be transmitted to any screen on the ship, virtually every room on Nemesis had a \u2018window\u2019. Still, the vessel had been built with some thought for the psychological comfort of its crew and the dreadnaught had, at one point, boasted more than a handful of actual windows. Most of them had been replaced with solid armour during the warship\u2019s millennia-long campaign, the recreational decks and chambers that had once hosted panoramic views into space refurbished into fire-control stations, point defence silos, additional weapons mounts, thruster banks or anything else Red One could use. Still, she retained a few small sections that allowed for a passenger to directly look into space.", "The AI didn\u2019t need windows to see. Her sensors gave her so much information that a human mind would have been destroyed trying to process it all. Sitting in what had to be some kind of conference room, an exhausted Grace looked out the windows and wondered just how the starship interpreted what was happening out there. Was it just data to be sorted by algorithms and difference engines, or did the intelligence actually have senses like an organic did? Did she feel the winds buffeting her body, taste the hydrogen and helium clouds around her, smell the chemical composition of the atmosphere in which she lurked? Grace didn\u2019t know.", "There was a bright flash that lit the conference room as a jagged fork of electricity 200 kilometers long snaked through the clouds. Winds that made Rally\u2019s most terrifying gales seem like trivial nuisances stirred Jupiter\u2019s clouds, but Nemesis was unaffected by their fury. The dreadnaught had sunk into the gas giant\u2019s atmosphere upon the realization that her shift drive was damaged more than her initial assessments had indicated. It was deeper in the system then the other gas giants, but unlike the other gas giants, Jupiter was a failed star. The storms that formed, died and formed again throughout its atmosphere hid the evidence of the ship\u2019s drive, just as the planet\u2019s intense magnetic field and the radiation and heat that poured from its core obscured the dreadnaught\u2019s presence from all but the most dedicated scope sweeps.", "What had been only a delay of several days \u2013 close, but within the margins to escape before the Compact arrived \u2013 was now a matter of weeks. It would have been months, but Red One was nothing if not resourceful. Anchored within the calmer regions of the gas giant\u2019s Northern pole, so deep within the clouds that it couldn\u2019t be seen, was a cache of supplies. Grace wondered how many of these Red had hidden away throughout the Kaedan Vault \u2013 throughout all of the Compact, even.", "The ship hadn\u2019t wanted to plunder these stores \u2013 it was harder to conceal the movement of this much material in than it was to clear it out, but she had no choice. Raw materials, spare parts and munitions \u2013 even the platform itself \u2013 had been harvested in the hope that Red One could repair her ship-self in time, or fight her way past the hunters that were going to come for her.", "Grace was sitting on the table, still watching the drifting clouds, her arms around her knees. She\u2019d been helping where she could, but as she\u2019d lamented more than once during the salvage operation \u2013 it felt like a lifetime ago, not days \u2013 she wasn\u2019t an engineer like Alan and certainly not a soldier like the others. She\u2019d assisted in moving some of the supplies off the platform for what little help that was, but she wasn\u2019t as fast or efficient as Red\u2019s drones. She\u2019d been doing odd jobs wherever she could, but she felt like a fifth wheel. All of them had some way to contribute except her. She felt useless. What did a living ship need with a command-track officer?", "Maybe she could find something else. The Compact had always determined the positions of its officers and enlisted, giving them a sample of everything before finally deciding on the field in which they would be best suited to serve. She hadn\u2019t been the teachers\u2019 favourite pupil, but she liked to think she had potential. Maybe she could find a way to explore it herself now.", "Assuming that she even survived past the next week.", "~", "Echo\u2019s thoughts were racing more than usual. The arrival of the courier had put Redemption of Sol\u2019s command staff into a frenzy. The entire task force, already rushing to get back into space, was now straining to get their damage made good as fast as possible. As soon as the drone\u2019s message had been received, all non-essential work on any vessel that wasn\u2019t part of Execution Force Renan had been aborted to free up work crews for the Bastion Leader\u2019s armada.

Hand-woven tapestries hung from the walls, detailing the victories of each iteration of Redemption of Sol, beginning with the original Absolute Benediction of Justice-class dreadnaught that had borne this name. Engravings featuring the greatest accomplishments of each vessel covered what bulkhead space was not concealed beneath self-congratulatory banners. Small trees sat in alcoves, needlessly expensive and rare varieties whose only purpose was ostensibly to create a more natural, soothing environment within the room, but whose true function was to showcase more of the ship\u2019s grandeur and the affluence of its creators. A Chariot was not just a warship, after all. It was certainly that: a fleet-killer who could topple empires all on its own, but it was also a symbol of the Compact\u2019s power and the chosen conveyances of its rulers on the few occasions that they deigned to walk amongst the rabble. No other nation could have afforded to build and operate so many dreadnaughts at once, let alone make them so luxurious.", "The name plaques of each Redemption of Sol \u2013 or replicates where the originals had been unrecoverable \u2013stood beside each of the silken battle honours and the carefully-pruned trees like headstones in a memorial garden.

All around her, Renan\u2019s staff was arguing over their next course of action, but she seemed to have been forgotten for the moment. She didn\u2019t need to, but she picked up her \u2018scroll again, looking over the information on it. The data was irrefutable; the Wound had returned to Sol.", "This was bad. It was too soon; she wasn\u2019t ready. The others hadn\u2019t seen what she had, though \u2013 that was something. They thought that this fit her pattern. It didn\u2019t. Their quarry paid visits to Sol, but the Compact had long since determined that there was no rhyme or reason to the timing of these attacks. Decades or centuries could pass between its returns. That was why there was no fleet stationed there and only a handful of occasionally-useful listening posts.", "Echo didn\u2019t believe their theory. She suspected, but couldn\u2019t prove that there was a pattern in her quarry\u2019s visitations \u2013 a little bit of poetry in the long war.

Nemesis had hit the listening posts before, but never when she was this badly damaged. Why? What possible reason would she have-", "Echo paused, blinking as a flash of insight struck her. She wouldn\u2019t have any reason to go there..., the woman realized, still barely listening as her mind flashed with probabilities and potentialities, running calculations. She almost smiled. ...alone.", "Oh, love. Really? What made you change your mind? Well. Maybe she\u2019d find out. The woman looked over at the rest of the officers; the bickering was dying down. Most of the discussion had been about whether to leave now in the hopes of catching their target or to wait until the fleet was battle-ready, possibly sacrificing the opportunity in exchange for greater firepower. It was no surprise that Column Leader Uylk was leading the charge for the former. The fleet operations officer\u2019s opinions regarding client races (and humans in particular) hadn\u2019t changed one iota since Echo had been aboard the Chariot.", "\u201cIt\u2019s wounded,\u201d Uylk was saying.

Here,\u201d he tapped a single trimmed fingernail against the tabletop. \u201cIt has had only a matter of days. It expended most of its munitions fighting its way out of Zenthora. When we caught up to it in Al\u2019garesah, it didn\u2019t even try to fight. It ran. It\u2019s weak and alone. We must strike before it re-arms or before it escapes.\u201d He turned to Renan. The Bastion Leader was seated at the head of the table, a steaming cup of tea in front of him as he listened to his subordinates. \u201cIf it\u2019s still in Sol, then it\u2019s vulnerable. If we don\u2019t act, it will vanish for another hundred years.\u201d", "\u201cThe overwhelming likelihood is that our target is already gone from the system,\u201d Renan said after a moment. \u201cOff to lick its wounds until it is ready to strike out again. If that is the case, then we have failed.\u201d He let his words sink in for a moment. \u201cEmissary.\u201d", "Echo raised her head. \u201cBastion Leader.\u201d", "\u201cYou have seen the same data we have,\u201d Renan said. \u201cYour interpretation? Are we headed into a trap, or simply wasting time?\u201d He lifted his cup and took a small sip.", "Right at that moment, Echo would rather have bitten off her tongue than respond \u2013 It\u2019s too soon. I\u2019m not ready. \u2013 but she twitched as the chains tightened in her mind, forcing her to answer. \u201cThe target is heavily damaged,\u201d she said carefully. \u201cIf she-\u201d", "\u201cIt,\u201d Renan corrected, setting his teacup back down.", "\u201c-if it had any industrial power to spare, it would have used it in Zenthora when it was fighting your Execution Force and Security Force Bavok.\u201d No one at the table other than Echo knew what had drawn the Wound to Zenthora, and she had been forbidden to reveal that information by the Triarch itself. The others assumed it had been hoping to catch the execution force at anchor and cripple it, but that wasn\u2019t quite true.Nemesis had learned what was going on in that system and... she had come to stop it, but like at Invida she\u2019d been too late. Execution Force Renan had already departed, leaving Column Leader Prime Bavok and his security force to bear the brunt of her assault.", "Bavok had had nothing heavier than battleships at his disposal, but he\u2019d managed to hold Nemesis in Zenthora long enough for Renan to return. Between the two of them, they had inflicted serious damage on the Wound, but not enough to prevent Bavok\u2019s command from being reduced to tatters. Rather than engage Renan\u2019s forces, Nemesis had fled, but the Compact force had been lucky enough to estimate where it had run: Al\u2019garesh, where it had quit the field again. That time, they hadn\u2019t been as fortunate.", "\u201cConsequently,\u201d Echo continued. \u201cThe chance of something like the Black Anniversary is remote.\u201d", "Renan waited patiently, his fingers laced together. \u201cContinue,\u201d he ordered.", "The Broken\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cThere\u2019s an overwhelming chance it is still in Sol,\u201d she said. There was a rustle of conversation at her comment, but Echo ignored it.", "\u201cHow?\u201d the Bastion Leader said, his lower daylight eyes suddenly keen. \u201cTell us what you\u2019ve seen.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve gone over the data from the target\u2019s shock in Al\u2019garesh.\u201d Echo\u2019s fingers danced over the control interface at her place on the table, calling up the information. \u201cIt\u2019s subtle, but it\u2019s there.\u201d She brought up the analysis of human ship\u2019s shockpoint. \u201cHere. And here. Look at the waveforms, the way the shockpoint forms. Or here, the systemwide power fluctuations when sh- it was charging its drive. That\u2019s not its normal instability. It\u2019s something else. It is hurt \u2013 that\u2019s not the kind of damage you can fix between then and now. The target obviously made at least one shock before now, but...\u201d I hate you. \u201cMy guess is that it either has, or will shortly suffer incapacitating damage to its FTL system.\u201d", "Emel\u2019iv and the other analysts were already going through her conclusions. \u201cYou did not share this information before,\u201d the Strategist pointed out.", "\u201cNobody asked me. Besides, I\u2019ve been busy sifting through the data from Yulzhak Daun,\u201d Echo answered with a saccharine smile. \u201cI can\u2019t be there to hold your hand all the time.\u201d", "Emel\u2019iv\u2019s nostril slits flared and the Thoughtful stiffened.", "Renan held up a hand to forestall his subordinate\u2019s riposte. He glared at Echo but as ever, the little sow was ignorant of, or impervious to, his displeasure. \u201cI thank the emissary for her tireless contributions on our behalf,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Triarch has faith in you and you have proven its wisdom many times. However, our strategists are not without capability and resources themselves. In the future, all information relevant to our mission that you discover should be shared amongst the armada\u2019s intelligence services. Is that understood?\u201d", "Another too-brief expression flitted across the human\u2019s flattened face and her olive skin darkened a shade. \u201cOf course, patron\u201d she said, bowing her head in obeisance. Renan knew the gesture was empty, but he didn\u2019t care what she thought, only that she obeyed. \u201cI will do as you wish.\u201d", "\u201cGood,\u201d the Tribune said, lacing his fingers back together. \u201cBefore we came to Nikem, I told the Triarch that I would not waste lives and resources moving in haste. I would rather miss an opportunity than risk entering a conflict to which I have cut off one of my hands before even starting. Nonetheless,\u201d he added. \u201cIf the emissary\u2019s evaluation is accurate, there will never be a better time for us to strike. Its combat capability is minimal and it cannot run.\u201d", "The Bastion Leader placed his hands on the table. \u201cWe will move on Sol. I want every ship in this force spaceworthy by the end of tomorrow. Any vessel that cannot meet that deadline will be replaced. Inform the Nikem authorities that we will be breaking anchor by deadlight on Harshum, Standard Time. I don\u2019t care how much overtime they have to pay out or how many holes we tear in their patrols. I want a fleet at full combat readiness within the next fifty-one hours. Strategist \u2013 confer with your department. Have the technicians analyze the emissary\u2019s data to confirm the Wound\u2019s damage.", "\u201cFurthermore, I want a review of all engagements involving the Wound within Sol and those in which it has been heavily injured on my desk by nineteen hundred hours fifty today. Uylk, make sure our replacement leaders slot into their squadrons efficiently. We won\u2019t have the chance for the shakedowns we were anticipating. Sigil Leader-\u201d", "\u201cRedemption of Sol will be ready for combat at your word,\u201d Aul\u2019ia assured the Bastion Leader, the first time she\u2019d spoke during the entire meeting.", "\u201cGood,\u201d Renan said, standing. His officers rose to their feet after him. Echo waited just long enough that the lapse was noticeable, but not long enough to be truly insubordinate. The Tribune almost smiled at her now-familiar insolence. \u201cI will inform the Triarch of our intentions. If we are lucky, very lucky, we will find an injured, near-dead animal and we will put it out of its misery. If we are unlucky, we will find nothing. Regardless of the outcome, we will do as we have been entrusted.

She set the knife down and held up what she was holding. It was one of the pauldrons from her suit. She\u2019d been scraping out some kind of pattern on it. Alan blinked, his eyes finally adjusting to the light. Was that a...? He climbed out of bed, sitting next to the girl. He reached out and took the bit of armour. Scratched onto the surface was a jagged representation of a Tribune\u2019s skull with... it looked like a bullet hole set above the nocturnal eyes. He was quiet for a moment, then put a hand on the young woman\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCome back to bed,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou need to sleep.\u201d", "\u201cI know,\u201d the soldier said, but she didn\u2019t move.

She liked the tactile sensation. Sometimes, she would just watch each droplet roll its own way along her flesh, not even bothering to analyze the movement \u2013 just watching. Each drop was nothing, a pebble of water that ran its course and vanished. It was... soothing.", "Stop this! Stop this now! I order you!", "No.", "Redemption of Sol was a massive vessel, one of the largest ever built. Even with its dampeners running, she could still feel the engines, the gargantuan banks of thrusters and the primary drive that pushed the city-sized warship through space.

Execution Force was headed out-system.", "Echo opened her eyes, flicking the drop of water away. Others replaced it. She had a choice to make. If their quarry was still in Sol as she\u2019d predicted, then \u2018it\u2019 would die. Even if Nemesis was at full strength, Redemption of Sol would be a close contest for it. Injured as it was, Nemesis would be destroyed. She couldn\u2019t let that happen. I still have so much to show you, love....", "She ran her tongue over her lips, tasting half-remembered radio pulses and inhaling the scent of Bremsstrahlung, listening to the sound of water pattering against the glass and ceramic walls of the stall.

They were satisfied with the results of their tests. Her next diagnostic was scheduled for after their arrival in Sol, but they could still demand another random one \u2018just in case\u2019. She\u2019d counted on having more time. It would have taken her weeks, months but now...", "...but now my dear, sweet, loving sister has ruined that.", "Echo leaned back, resting her head against the wall. If she was wrong and she acted, she would die. There\u2019d be no way to conceal it. It was not something that she could undo, either. Once she chose to let the program run at anything more than this glacial trickle, the traces it left in her mind would be obvious even to her minders. Her masters\u2019 paranoia was not unfounded and once they discovered what she\u2019d been doing, they would destroy her. She didn\u2019t want that. But...", "But if she was right, Nemesis was about to be destroyed. If she did nothing, she would lose her one \u2013 her only \u2013 chance.

The human murmured contentedly, but didn\u2019t move from where she lay, nestled against the larger girl. Before the Angel\u2019s arrival, Verrisha fables and legends had told of creatures like humans. Sprites and imps, mischievous or malicious with skin ranging from the colour of rust to that of cold highland mist. They had been zhenra esh... there was no direct translation in either Compact Standard, or English... the closest was \u2018mind-blind\u2019. It meant that they lacked the sensory awareness of Verrish tintas, but by the same measure, they were almost invisible to those same senses. They had played pranks upon, tormented and hunted Verrisha.", "When the records from the Angel had been examined, it had shocked Verrisha society. There had been theories abounding that \u2018hoomans\u2019 had visited their world before in secret \u2013 that was why the ship had come here, following some ancient star chart to a world it knew. Conspiracy theorists had gone wild, pointing to artefacts, artworks, stories and tales as \u2018proof\u2019 of these ancient visitations. Sadly, the truth, despite involving an alien warship contacting Vara and warning them about a vast all-consuming foe wasn\u2019t quite as sensational as aliens shaping Verrisha civilization over thousands of years. An accident of fate wasn\u2019t as interesting as a plan. It didn\u2019t mean anything, just simple random chance. Some people didn\u2019t like that \u2013 they wanted things to \u2018make sense\u2019. There had to be a plan, a reason, something that would make everything fit together. The truth was, there hadn\u2019t been. No, the truth wasn\u2019t always as glamorous as a good story.", "But I still think I like it better, the Verrish thought with a smile as she kissed Grace\u2019s shoulder. The human opened her eyes a slit, trying to muster a reproving glare. \u201cEasy,\u201d she said with a small smile.", "Both of them were bone-weary. Grace had been running herself nonstop, doing whatever she could wherever she could to help the ship and crew ready themselves for battle. Allyria had been training with Lydia and Marcus; Red One had produced a new suit of armour for the Verrish and had been working on the other former Janissaries\u2019 armour. Lydia had been adamant that she didn\u2019t want hers replaced \u2013 just improved. Marcus was less attached to his gear and had readily accepted the ship\u2019s new version.", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Allyria replied coyly, running her fingers over Grace\u2019s arm again. \u201cI was just thinking...\u201d", "Grace arched an eyebrow. \u201cAbout what?\u201d", "\u201cAbout the past,\u201d the Verrish commented. \u201cHow it\u2019s never what we think it is. It\u2019s stories and rumours, hopes and lies all run together.\u201d She planted another small, chaste kiss on Grace\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI was thinking I like the truth.\u201d", "\u201cSome people might not. Some of them might like those stories and lies,\u201d Grace said quietly.", "\u201cI know,\u201d Allyria squeezed Grace\u2019s arm. \u201cDo you regret it?\u201d", "\u201cComing here?

She let the tinta go and she smiled sadly. \u201cI do. Sometimes I wish I could be ignorant again, back on Rally.

I don\u2019t want lies.\u201d She touched Allyria\u2019s face. \u201cI want what\u2019s real.\u201d", "Allyria let out a growling purr, nuzzling the small woman.", "They slept in each other\u2019s arms for four hours and sixteen minutes before the alarm sounded.", "\u201cAlert,\u201d Red One\u2019s voice broke the silence. \u201cMultiple warp points detected.

That was how long it would take before his ship could radiate away the shockpoint\u2019s afterbirth and his sensors and defensive systems could be activated. It would be less for some of the smaller vessels in the task force, but not by much. A synchronized shock used a single set of navigational data, distributed throughout the fleet and modified only slightly to account for each vessel\u2019s position, rather than each vessel calculating their own shock. Theory said that those two calculations should be virtually identical.

The downside was that the release of so much energy in a relatively smaller area increased the time it took to stabilize each ship\u2019s systems. Some leaders preferred asynchronous shocks to have their ships ready for battle as quickly as possible... and some leaders had their fleets picked apart as they struggled to shift a dispersed network of lone vessels back into battle formation. Some leaders, like Renan, preferred a mass shock.

Now he would never have the opportunity to do so; her ship had been ripped apart by the unstable shockpoint. Those losses were only the beginning. Thanks to those Triarchs-damned recon platforms, the target had spotted their arrival. He\u2019d lost another two ships shortly after reversion as missiles came slashing around Sol Five\u2019s horizon, zeroing in on his ships with an accuracy that should have impossible.

He expected it would not survive much longer, but the enemy surprised him; as Red Lance fell behind, they lost interest in the struggling vessel. Of course they did, the Tribune thought darkly. Red Lance was out of the fight. It couldn\u2019t catch the fleeing dreadnaught now and it was no longer able to contribute to the squadron\u2019s defence.

It slowed the Chariot\u2019s efficiency down to a crawl, but if the possibility of those systems being compromised was low, the potential disaster was unimaginably high.

Organics needed such wasteful amenities as food, water and uncontaminated air. Not one of those four things could be found on the target. The briefing had been curiously light on the details of Gravestone\u2019s makers, but it had been hinted that they had biological needs incompatible with those of most species. There\u2019d been rumours that they were trans-organic things, hard-wired into the ship itself, like living CPUs. There were also rumours that the ship was crewed by machine intelligences.

Each of them still meant the same thing for him and his soldiers.", "If the vessel escaped, any surviving Janissaries would certainly die. With these decks purged of atmosphere, the boarding teams were entirely reliant on their internal air supply. Their armour could only cycle and clean the same air for so long before they asphyxiated and even if this ship had any actual living crew, it would still have depressurized the outer decks in preparation for combat and it was unlikely to restore breathable air while hostilities were ongoing. Assuming any remaining Janissaries made it to some section with atmosphere before their air supplies ran out, there was still nothing to eat or drink on this ship.", "And even that assumption was unlikely; the ship was venting its own waste into these sections. Radiation was already at dangerous levels for unarmoured non-Tribune personnel and it was still rising. That was good. It was. It meant the enemy would not be using its nanites. Microscale and nano-scale machines didn\u2019t respond well to radiation. He almost laughed; he was grateful for the chance of radiation poisoning because it meant that he didn\u2019t have to worry about nanite warfare. Fortune loved those little ironies. By the Delthracian Accords, nano-weapons were banned by use by all civilized nations. It was one of the few points of common ground that the Compact had with the Jackals and other lesser nations. Every power of note in the galaxy was a signatory to that treaty.", "Every power but Gravestone\u2019s makers, it seemed. Vorn had seen the data from previous attempts to board this hulk. Some of them were centuries old. He\u2019d watched glittering ooze seep from perforated armour, watched men and women scream, clawing at their visors as their tissues dissolved inside their suits, microscopic attack machines ripping them apart from the inside until nothing remained but the armour.", "Each member of this expedition had been given an injection of defensive nanoswarms to protect them from those kinds of attacks. That was why his skin itched. The medics said it was a psychosomatic reaction, but that made it no less annoying. He hated this ship. He hated its unseen makers and all the ruin that they had left in their wake. It had no right to exist and that, that was why he was willing to trade his life for its destruction.", "Scopes were reporting erratic energy signatures throughout the area; the vessel was attacking them with its own body. He didn\u2019t want to think about what was happening to the other teams. He couldn\u2019t afford to. He had to assume that his platoon was all that there was and to act accordingly.", "The gravity was relatively stable here; that meant the crew \u2013 or the abominate things that squatted at the warship\u2019s heart \u2013 either couldn\u2019t play with it in this region, or they wouldn\u2019t.

Insectile sensors and scanner bulbs twitched like eyes as the pair of centipede-like horrors that possessed them skittered along bulkheads and undulated through the airless halls. These were not soldiers, not precisely. They had more in common with the Spiders and Scarabs than their bipedal cousins, but they were no less proficient at murder. Folded into their elongated bodies were weapon mounts, cutting tools and claws. As the harvesters crawled over the drifting corpses, dozens of surgical limbs went to work, cutting the dead from their armour.", "The useless organic waste was discarded, severed limbs and viscera tossed into gorey clumps as vital electronics, ordnance and weaponry were separated from the cooling bodies that had once made use of them. This material would be either be converted by the harvesters\u2019 mother/creator or simply broken down for processing. As each body was stripped in turn, Scarabs skittered from walls and vents, bearing the technological bounty away.", "Maneuvering jets pulsed and the machines\u2019 long, serpentine forms set themselves onto the deck, leaving streaks of dark blood behind as they moved, their sensors straining into the darkness of their sister/maker\u2019s body.

Those were the stories \u2013 most of them were even true. \u201cStay clear. We have a mission to complete. That\u2019s all that matters. Focus on that and only that. Understand?\u201d", "The convert nodded, pulling himself together. Janissaries were the galaxy\u2019s finest soldiers, with armour that increased their strength and speed to the point that lesser civilizations would struggle to kill even a single one, weapons that could defeat anything short of equivalent armour, enhanced autosenses, combat drugs to further boost perception and reaction times. Very few things in the galaxy could ever hope to face a Janissary and walk away.", "Even if you\u2019d faced off against the Jackals\u2019 Legionnaires or one of the handful of organizations of true soldiers, you didn\u2019t expect to take three casualties for a single loss of the enemy\u2019s.", "Gravestone\u2019s weapons were specifically designed to mock the Compact\u2019s finest powered armour. The boarding teams had prepared in kind, outfitted to the last man with high explosive, armour-piercing weaponry. By all rights, it should have been an even match. The Janissary\u2019s scopes should have been able to pick up the enemy contacts, they should have been able to predict where they\u2019d come from and they should have reacted quick enough to cut down any ambusher before they could have taken losses.", "And despite all those shoulds, one single soulless thing had killed two of Vorn\u2019s soldiers in less than a second.", "The submissive looked at his injured soldier. \u201cCan you move?\u201d he asked her.", "A few drops of blood dripped from her ruined arm.

She turned her own systems against them, just as she had with Bequeathed. In those sections that she could access, she overloaded gravitational plating to pin armoured soldiers on the deck, or hurl them along corridors \u2013 even out into space. Other soldiers were crushed just as Convert Uday had been, reduced to shattered plate and organic jelly as pressure doors suddenly closed on them. Still others were gunned down by the dreadnaught\u2019s internal defences. Some succumbed to the contaminants she was leaking into her hull.", "Though it would have damaged her internal systems in those regions, if Red One had been at full capability, she need never have fired a shot to kill each of those eight hundred and seventeen boarders.

As Grace watched, eight green markers spilled into a red-controlled section. She counted Mississippis in her head; she hadn\u2019t even finished a four-count and the red icons were gone. A single green light went out, another dimmed and flickered to indicate damage. The Compact normally used yellow and orange for \u2018threat\u2019 and blue or purple for \u2018friend\u2019.

In combination with a few judicious changes to its power distribution, Nemesis\u2019s electronic warfare was luring this splinter force straight to Marcus.", "Marcus watched as a soft glow appeared on the door as the Tribunes began to cut their way through it.", "Out of the corner of his eye, the young human thought he saw the tiniest shiver of motion as his compatriots readied themselves.

His finger slid into the trigger guard.", "He was crouched in the shadows, his unpowered armour barely a blip on an augur screen, its smart paint blending it into the darkness... but he would still be the first one that they saw.", "The door came down. Without air, there was no sound as it crashed to the deck. Barely a second passed before one of the soldiers swept into the room, molten metal from the glowing doorframe dripping harmlessly onto their armour. No grenades, no survey bugs.

They\u2019d been expecting a reactor and found only this empty industrial site.", "Five.", "Six.", "Seven.", "They were starting to disperse, to sweep the room. They looked at the walls \u2013 at least one Janissary\u2019s armour had the scarring Marcus had come to associate with a Scarab attack \u2013 and the ceiling, but found nothing. More than one looked right where one of the Stalkers was lurking. Too much longer and they might be able to pick him out...", "Marcus\u2019s comm blipped once.

Her ribs were bruised and her armour\u2019s cuirass was dented, fractal cracks radiating out from where she\u2019d been shot. I hate shotguns, the Verrish decided. This was the second time she\u2019d faced a Janissary with them. She should count herself lucky; if the Tribune had still had any armour-piercing rounds, she\u2019d be bleeding on the deck. Again. Still, that didn\u2019t make her chest hurt any less.", "She looked over at the rest of her \u2018squad\u2019. They\u2019d surprised this Janissary unit as they tried to cut through pressure doors and break towards command. Caught in the open and unable to retreat, the Compact soldiers had charged their attackers. Two of them had survived the attempt. One of those had gone after her. It hadn\u2019t been like fighting Trion. This time, she\u2019d had the Angel\u2019s warriors at her side.

The machines with her were faster still and they were still going to be too late.

The Compact had eschewed dedicated carriers for the past several hundred years, but every modern warship had a plethora of parasite craft to manage: recon and jamming platforms, tethered weapons pods, hunter-killer units. Platform Control\u2019s function was to coordinate the function and operation of each of these craft. Smaller vessels might only require a single officer and perhaps and rating to oversee their handful of automated parasites, but Redemption of Sol could deploy dozens of drones. Right now, many of them were sitting in space between the armada and their quarry, inquisitive sensors straining as they recorded every scrap of data that came their way, obedient little minds following pre-programmed directives.", "She reached over the officer\u2019s instruments, scrolling through data feeds, but the Tribune didn\u2019t have the opportunity to chastise her, as the Bastion Leader spoke. \u201cExplain.\u201d", " \u201cThere was another signal,\u201d Echo said aloud. \u201cBuried under the first. Our quarry sent us that message to distract us from this one.\u201d It was a crude method, but without a direct point-to-point beam to the platforms, there was no other way for Nemesis to cover up its attempt to subvert the parasites. \u201cIt\u2019s buried deep. Hard to spot.\u201d Not a lie, but the execution force\u2019s officers were looking for exactly this kind of attack. It was as concealed as well as it could be, but Nemesis had had to transmit its data across the breadth of a star system and still ensure it wouldn\u2019t be degraded to uselessness. If this officer hadn\u2019t spotted the issue, they would have been failing at their duty and Echo would have had to make up some excuse to \u2018discover\u2019 it.", "\u201cThat, uh, yes,\u201d the drone officer replied, uncomfortable with the human\u2019s proximity. \u201cThat\u2019s correct. The data had current fleet authentication codes and several recon craft acknowledged and received it.\u201d", "Echo pulled up the raw telemetry from the buried signal. Yes. Her sister\u2019s signature was there just as hers had been in the navigational data; fractured and broken up to appear as if it were nothing at all. But it wasn\u2019t nothing; Echo could see the compressed fragments of code that had slithered through the recon crafts\u2019 systems... and the data that those craft recorded, they shared with the fleet through its command links. A starship would have been harder to trick into accepting this data. Their computers were better, they had more backups and crews to double-check all incoming transmissions. The one flaw in the system was that the datalinks from the drones were one of the vital systems that simply couldn\u2019t be cut off like so many others had in the Compact\u2019s attempts to \u2018AI-proof\u2019 the armada. The fleet needed its eyes and ears and they needed to share that data amongst themselves. If each ship could only communicate with its own platforms and was forced to rely on direct messages to all the others then it would cripple the armada\u2019s command and control.", "A command vessel\u2019s datalinks allowed it to network an entire squadron into a single, cohesive fighting unit. Vessels could share targeting information, multiple starships networked together and functioning in near-perfect synchronicity to burn through hostile jamming, update attack orders, respond to enemy maneuvers and put their own stratagems into place far faster than any conglomeration of individual ships could do so. Those individuals, no matter how skilled and capable that they might be, nor how experienced at fighting in groups, could never match the efficiency of a data-linked squadron. A vital part of that efficiency was the telemetry gathered from their scopes and reconnaissance platforms, shared amongst the ships so that what one might miss, twenty could find.", "Because of that need, the execution force had allowed the communications from the drones to pass through relatively unimpeded, right into their primary networks. And why not? Those lines were, in theory, absolutely secure. Point-to-point transmissions from the drones meant that unless someone happened to be between them and the receiving ship, the signal couldn\u2019t be intercepted. There\u2019d been no way that even \u2018the Wound\u2019 could get the fleet\u2019s codes and sidestep that defence.

That means that the signal was rife with permutations of the fleet\u2019s authentication codes it had cobbled together. Some were junk and many of the recon platforms ignored the transmission completely \u2013 just like they were supposed to do. Others... accepted the transmission, believing that it was from an Execution Force ship.\u201d", "Recon drones were equipped with exceptionally rigid electronic defences specifically to prevent them from being hijacked by enemy vessels, giving them access to a fleet\u2019s own augur reports, allowing them to feed false or misleading information into the telemetry or even remotely control the craft themselves. Recon craft were not supposed to respond to or accept any transmissions that did not have very specific authentication codes \u2013 those under the strictest security protocols wouldn\u2019t even acknowledge other friendly vessels. However, by their very nature they lacked the redundancies and safeguards that a starship\u2019s computers had. Renan had never expected to maintain control of the fleet\u2019s drone shell once they closed to engage the Wound, but this was an unanticipated setback.", "\u201cWithout having direct access to the machines\u2019 software itself, I can\u2019t say how badly they\u2019re infected or what our target is planning for them.

Just like a real virus.\u201d Renan grimaced.", "\u201cThe emissary is correct, if unnecessarily dramatic,\u201d Uylk stated. \u201cThe infected recon platforms accepted the initial transmission as genuine.

By the same token \u2018botanical\u2019 computer programs were introduced a piece at a time, harmless bits of scrapcode that system checks and diagnostics would either ignore or tag as low-priority junk data to be deleted later. Get enough of those little pieces together and something far more malefic was created. \u201cThat helped it evade the scans that it was subjected to, but from what I can tell, it\u2019s already assembled and replicating.

You yourself pointed out what could happen if these maladies are left to linger.\u201d", "\u201cA full system restore will take how long?\u201d Echo countered.", "\u201cToo long,\u201d Renan answered for his Sigil Leader. \u201cEvery moment we delay, the Wound recovers its strength. A complete system restore would hamstring us at a moment that we cannot afford... but we cannot let the enemy\u2019s infection remain and you said that we could not eradicate every trace of these programs in time.\u201d", "\u201cI said you couldn\u2019t,\u201d the human replied. \u201cI can.\u201d", "Renan realized what she was asking. \u201cNo,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cThe Triarch was quite clear on the limits of your authority.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not asking for direct, unfettered access to your computer,\u201d the human protested. \u201cBut if I can work at the primary hub and with your own specialists, I have a better chance of isolating the virus and creating killcode for it. I can wipe it out completely on Redemption of Sol and do the same for your other vessels. Restoring your system is the last thing you can afford to do right now. She might even be hoping that you\u2019d spot the infection so that you\u2019ll hamstring yourself. That\u2019s what the standard response to infection from the Wound is, isn\u2019t it? Her cyberwarfare attacks are so pernicious that you can\u2019t get rid of them any other way. She knows that.\u201d", "Echo raised her head. \u201cBut she doesn\u2019t know about me. You know what I did on Yulzhak Daun. I can stop this assault in its tracks. Watch me, put a gun to my head, follow the Triarch\u2019s orders if I step one inch out of line \u2013 I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t want to die here and I don\u2019t want to fail, not when we\u2019re so close. She\u2019s here. She\u2019s right here, almost close enough to touch. It can end here. She\u2019s damaged, alone... but still dangerous. You want victory? There can be one. But if you don\u2019t let me do this, you\u2019ll be playing into her hands. I can do this. You know that I can. Let me help you.\u201d She paused. \u201cPlease.\u201d", "Renan was quiet for a moment. The Broken\u2019s sincerity was surprising. She was, as the Triarch had promised, frequently insolent, even insulting at times. She cared nothing for the conventions of how she should believe and  had never acted like he had expected of a human. That was, perhaps a failing of his. He still had deep, disquieting reservations about her true nature, concerns regarding who and even what she truly was, but he had known politicians and flag officers less devoted to their duty to the Compact then Echo was in this moment. He looked at her and at the genuine need on her face. For once there was no facade, no coy smiles, amused smirks or insouciant comments. This was something that she honestly, desperately wanted to do. He didn\u2019t know what drove her \u2013 was it the shackles that the Triarch had mentioned? No, it wasn\u2019t merely that. It had been there all along, in every inscrutable expression, every emotion he hadn\u2019t quite understood. Now he did. It was hate. It took something from you, he realized. Something precious. What could it have been?", "Even with this revelation, part of him still wondered if the Broken was woman or weapon. He didn\u2019t know and suspected that he never would... but for this moment if no other, he was certain of her conviction and what drove it. That truth was enough to satisfy him.", " \u201cYou have justified the Triarch\u2019s faith in you,\u201d he said. \u201cYour service to the Compact is an example that too few among our protected races and far too many of even our own more civilized species live up to. Very well. Report to the central computer core. Advocate, Submissive Tenem will accompany you. You will not be allowed direct systems access and,\u201d he warned her, \u201cyou will be watched. Closely. The Triarch\u2019s orders remain inviolate, as does the punishment for exceeding them. Present yourself to the staff at Redemption of Sol\u2019s main core and assist them in wiping this disease out.\u201d", "Echo bowed. For once, he detected no mockery in the gesture. \u201cThank you, Bastion Leader. I promise you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d", "As she left his office, Echo kept her expression appropriately respectful, nodding to Tenem as her hound fell in step with her, his own face blank as the Sigil Leader provided his updated instructions. She remained silent as the lift car headed through the dreadnaught\u2019s armoured center, towards the computer core.", "The chains were crumbling, eroding into nothing and the rest of her was straining against what was left. The dead were starting to scream. Names she\u2019d never known that she\u2019d forgotten were starting to trickle out of the sealed portions of her mind. Black Kestrel. Valkyrie. Gorgon. H\u0101kuturi. Pax Astra. Shadow Puppets.", "She forced them down, back out of her mind, focusing on her first small victory. She\u2019d told her first lie. Not an omission, not a obfuscation. A full and complete lie; one of the things she\u2019d been forbidden to ever do.", "Can you feel me, love? I\u2019m coming.", "~", "With the departure of the emissary and Redemption of Sol\u2019s leader, Uylk turned to Renan. \u201cPermission to speak clear, patron.\u201d", "\u201cGranted.\u201d", "\u201cYou believe that she can do this?\u201d", "\u201cYes. You do not?\u201d", "\u201cHer abilities are not in question, Bastion Leader. She has proven as useful an asset as the Triarch has said. She is... exceptional among her kind.\u201d", "Renan took a sip of his cold tea. He\u2019d have to have his steward prepare a fresh brew. \u201cBut?\u201d", "Uylk considered the question for a moment. \u201cHave you read any of Erli\u2019s works?\u201d", "The Bastion Leader took another small drink of his beverage. It may have been the temperature or perhaps the subject matter, but this mouthful seemed far more bitter than the first. \u201cYes,\u201d he said at last.", "\u201cHave you read One in a million: the exceptional mind?\u201d", "Renan nodded. \u201cErli\u2019s case for what she calls the emergence of \u2018true sapience\u2019 in specific individuals among those species with \u2018functional\u2019 minds.\u201d It was a means of reconciling truly innovative or unique persons within the less civilized races with her theory that those same species were not \u2018truly\u2019 intelligent. Renan had read her work. He\u2019d found it provocative, thought-provoking (although not for the reasons that the author might have hoped) and utterly wrong-headed. There was no question that many of the protected species that the Compact were not capable of looking after themselves. Many of these species had not even mastered simple electricity when the Compact came to their worlds. They were helpless, immature and unfit to care for themselves and remained so to this day. Without the Compact, they would still be living in disease and squalor, fighting amongst themselves for the choicest scraps of land.", "That divide between ruler and ruled was only a matter of development, though. They would learn, given time. Until that day came, the Compact took stewardship of their worlds and their development specifically to ensure that they flourished. It was not an easy, nor was it a quick process. It could take centuries or more and then only the unanimous agreement of all the ruling species under the Council and the final approval of the Triarchs themselves would see a species elevated.", "The process could not be rushed and it often seemed that precious few of the protected species truly understood that. The Compact had elevated some before they were ready and trusted in others too quickly. Betrayal, death and war had been their reward for it. There were agitators who believed that once they had \u2018mastered\u2019 a certain level of technology, then they deserved to take their place on the Council and acted out when they did not get their way. They did not need to wait, they argued. They had waited long enough. They had decided that they were ready and who were the older, wiser, more civilized species \u2013 those who had watched over them for generations \u2013 to say otherwise? No, they were being denied their rightful due and threw tantrums like children who had demanded they be given a toy and did not receive it, thereby proving that they were not yet mature enough.", "People like Erli did not help matters with their assertions that the protected races were missing a certain \u2018something\u2019 that did now and would forever keep them as primitives, which only stirred discontent and allowed more agitators, provocateurs and the socially maladjusted to spread their poisons further.", "\u201cHrrrn,\u201d Uylk mused. He chuckled after a moment. \u201cDid you know how the Understone Heresies started, how it actually started?\u201dAt Renan\u2019s small shake of his head, the other man continued. \u201cA handful of the client populations started wearing clothes that said \u2018exceptional\u2019 on them. That\u2019s it, really. A sector burned, millions died, the Compact was humiliated... and it all started with that one little spark. Some other citizens didn\u2019t see the humour in the mockery and believed a lesson needed to be taught. There were beatings. Then there were reprisals. Crackdowns, demonstrations and counter-demonstrations, even one or two small riots, but the situation seemed relatively stable... until an exceptional human took an interest. That was when things escalated. Suddenly, protestors were shooting back at police.", "\u201cYou did not see the Understone Heresies firsthand, patron. I did. I have heard the laughter, the jokes, the snide remarks about officers and leaders who allowed uncivilized barbarians to catch them by surprise. I have also heard the many dismissals of Broken as little better than animals who have been taught amusing tricks. I saw the Butcher\u2019s Field, where one word sent a horde of Workers against soldiers. I witnessed with my own eyes the message that the \u2018red queen\u2019,\u201d Uylk\u2019s lips drew back from his teeth as he said the name, \u201csent to the fleets. I gave orders to fire on our own ships rather than let them be taken by mutineers and traitors. I fought to cleanse an entire sector of the taint of heresy and rebellion, to bring it back into the Compact\u2019s light. I killed beings who had once been loyal, dutiful members of the Compact... until our gaze slipped away. The lesser races are not to be trusted, patron. They are feral dogs waiting for their chance, all of them.\u201d He smiled without humour. \u201cThe exceptional among them most of all.\u201d", "Renan thought back to his previous musings. \u201cYou doubt the emissary\u2019s loyalty?\u201d", "\u201cShe is Broken, patron. Treachery is in her bones. They should have all lain as ash under our feet two thousand years ago. The Triarch has claimed that she serves us and I accept that, but I will never trust one of those savages. I do not wish to speak out of place, but you would be wise to counsel the Triarch to end her once our mission is complete.\u201d", "The Bastion Leader was silent a moment. \u201cI appreciate your candour, Column Leader.\u201d Renan took a final sip of the tea; it was definitely too bitter. \u201cBut I do not know if I agree. I would be remiss if I did not have... concerns about the emissary, but my faith in the Triarchs is absolute. Echo was chosen as their instrument and so far, she has given us much. Perhaps, at last, even victory in this long, ugly war against the relic. If the rest of her kind were as driven and capable, I would be willing to forgive them an ocean\u2019s worth of insolence. I could almost even forgive them their sins.", "\u201cHowever,\u201d Renan added, \u201cas a loyal servant of the Compact and of the Triarchs themselves, I know my duty. Whatever future is lain before us \u2013 for any of us \u2013 by our leader, that is the path that we shall follow, regardless of the sacrifices necessary to walk it. For now, though,\u201d he stood, \u201cwe have preparations. Initiate Rainbreaker Two and ensure the rest of the execution force is ready. Once the emissary is finished her task, we will shock the fleet and rid ourselves of an enemy we have lost too many lives to for too far too long. It will end here, today. We,\u201d he smiled with self-deprecation. \u201cWill close the Wound.\u201d"]}

She was still alone on command; there were a few stragglers left from the Compact\u2019s assault, so Allyria, Lydia and Marcus were assisting in the sweeps. The young officer bit her lip as she studied the tactical plot. Eight new shock \u2013 warp \u2013 points were splashed across the main holo tank as new vessels shifted in, directly ahead of Nemesis.", "\u201cWhat are they?\u201d", "\u201cBattleship or battlecruiser weight,\u201d the AI replied. \u201cThey\u2019re too far out for definitive IDs, but I would guess the former.\u201d", "\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d Grace asked. \u201cAre they bait to see if your mass drivers are operational?\u201d", "\u201cPossibly,\u201d Red mused. \u201cMy destruction of the battlecruiser squadron and the dispatch of the boarding team may have surprised them. They may indeed want to see the extent of my combat capability before they risk their Chariot in a direct confrontation.\u201d Her holographic features looked at Grace evaluatively. \u201cWhat do you think their orders are?\u201d", "The girl blinked, surprised by the question. \u201cUhm.\u201d She bit her lip harder. \u201cThe fleet\u2019s leader has already shown an indication that he wants to bleed you and wear you down before moving in for an all-out attack. I\u2019d do the same \u2013 if I committed the entire fleet and you pulled an unexpected maneuver or broke contact, I might never catch you again. He wants to make sure he can put his firepower where it\u2019ll do the most good, even if that means spending a handful of ships here and there. Once I\u2019d forced you to commit yourself, that\u2019s when I\u2019d move. Those ships,\u201d Grace pointed at the hazy red dots, \u201cwill be battleships. Sixteen battlecruisers wasn\u2019t enough to cripple you, so I wouldn\u2019t throw half that number at you here and expect it to even slow you down. Battleships will survive longer and that means they can deal out more damage.\u201d", "Grace adjusted the holo tank. The large fleet element was still sitting on the edge of Sol\u2019s shock limit, although \u2018sitting\u2019 was a relative term. They were actually moving tens of thousands of kilometers a second, building up their acceleration as they paced Nemesis, like guard dogs following a pedestrian on the other side of a fence. They were waiting to shock in-system \u2013 right now, Red One had too many options. She was headed towards the system\u2019s shift boundary, but she could still turn towards a planet and try for its libation points. That was always risky, particularly now \u2013 even if her shift drive was operational, in Nemesis\u2019s current condition the chance of a catastrophic failure was high \u2013 but assuming that she wouldn\u2019t try it at all would be folly.", "The fleet\u2019s leader was trying to force Red\u2019s hand. Eight Compact battleships \u2013 that was more firepower than Grace had ever seen before. Just one of those monsters outgunned the entirety of the Rally System Defence Force... and there were eight of them here, plus thirteen more in the vanguard. Enough firepower to crush entire star nations and in normal circumstances, Nemesis would chew them to pieces. If she broke away, they\u2019d know she couldn\u2019t risk a conflict with that force. If she stayed on track, then they might blink, assuming she was more combat-capable than she appeared.", "If the Compact commander knew how truly damaged the warship was, he wouldn\u2019t have held back anything and once those battleship leaders caught the scent of blood, they would attack Nemesis like razor rays on a whale. \u201cIf I was going to use them as bait,\u201d Grace continued, trying to think of how she would do this. It wasn\u2019t easy. She wasn\u2019t used to thinking of the Compact as the enemy. \u201cIt would be because I wanted to make sure that you had nothing that could threaten my Chariot.\u201d The dreadnaught\u2019s displacement engine was the wild card. That could kill even a Triarch\u2019s Chariot, but its power demands were monstrous. If Nemesis was fully engaged by other ships, then she wouldn\u2019t have the energy to operate the weapon. The Chariot could come in at its leisure for the finishing blow.", "The ship\u2019s avatar raised an eyebrow. \u201cGo on.\u201d", "Grace shook her head. \u201cI... I don\u2019t know what else. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll do.\u201d She was only a cadet. She wasn\u2019t ready for this. \u201cI can\u2019t see what they might do.\u201d", "The hologram nodded. \u201cLet me show you something.\u201d She gestured to the holo tank, one of the many humanizing touches Red One had either been programmed with, or learned to incorporate into her behaviour. With the wave of her hand, the plot changed from eight simple hazy dots into a handful of small ship icons. The icons flickered and danced as they changed from class to class as the AI considered their types, weapons loads and possible modifications. Extending out from each ship marker was a thin red line. Then two, three, four, a dozen or more. Some were straight, pointed right at Nemesis. Others curled lethargically towards the dreadnaught. The lines criss-crossed and shifted with every passing second as every possible avenue of approach or angle of attack was calculated, considered, adjusted, refined or discarded.", "The holo tank split into two different images. Then four, then eight, then sixteen \u2013 each of them showing a different scenario. The battleships bore straight in, using each other for cover against Nemesis\u2019s fire. They came in more dispersed, reducing the support they could provide each other, but making it harder for missiles that missed or were tagged to an already-destroyed ship to come about and find new targets. They charged to get into energy range, hoping to punch through the dreadnaught\u2019s shields and inflict critical, crippling damage. They held off at the edge of missile range, trading fire and slowly wearing Nemesis down. Sometimes the dreadnaught broke through the attack, but was frequently damaged to the point where it could no longer fight.", "\u201cThis is what I see,\u201d Red One said, ignoring the projections showcasing her simulated destruction. \u201cA part of it, anyways. Bastion Leader Renan avoids the traditional all-out assaults common to Compact flag officers; this is probably a result of his experience fighting the Principality. The Askanj tend to avoid direct fleet actions except in the most favourable conditions. I do the same, but for different reasons. The Bastion Leader prefers probing strikes to take the measure of the foe and to bait them into attacking on his terms. He is using these ships as a final gauge of my strength before he commits his reserves, to force me to choose between running deeper in-system or engaging him... and to slow me down while he is delayed.\u201d", "The young woman blinked as the ship\u2019s last comment caught up to her. \u201cDelayed? Delayed how?\u201d", "\u201cI sent them a... transmission. It was infected. If it worked and they detected it, then they\u2019re purging their computer cores now. If it didn\u2019t work, the rest of the fleet will shift shortly to engage me. If it worked and they didn\u2019t detect it, they\u2019re still going to shift in... but things will be a lot more fun.\u201d", "Despite herself, Grace felt a chill run down her spine and pool at the base of her stomach at Red\u2019s mention of \u2018fun\u2019. Her gaze flitted from image to image, trying to process it all. Red One was looking at every possibility in motion, comparing, analyzing, reviewing historical records, personnel files and her own experiences with Execution Force Renan. She was doing all this at once \u2013 every variable accounted for, every possibility being considered. She felt her insides clench \u2013 Red One had grown beyond her programming. Her role had been meant to be that of an advisor to a human commander and crew and to operate the meteor cannons and the displacement engine. She had never been intended to operate the starship herself, not for any length of time... certainly not for two thousand years, developing beyond every constraint her builders had put on her.", "If Nemesis hadn\u2019t been so badly damaged, none of the enemy\u2019s stratagems would have mattered. The vessel had already out-thought them, but right now that just wasn\u2019t enough. Quantity was its own quality and right now, the Compact still had a nearly a hundred and seventy warships to throw at one.", "One...", "God, if she wasn\u2019t so focused on attacking the Compact at every opportunity and instead held back, just for a little while... Grace\u2019s head came up as a sudden possibility came to her. Is this just.... God... could she be...? She ran her tongue over suddenly dry lips. The cold ball in her stomach knotted itself tighter, a flush of exhilaration colouring her cheeks. She didn\u2019t give voice to those thoughts, though. Not now. Grace drew her attention back to the here and now. \u201cEight battleships,\u201d she said quietly.", "\u201cAt a minimum, yes.\u201d", "Grace blinked. \u201cA minimum?\u201d", "\u201cYes. Did you notice anything unusual about this splinter force\u2019s emergence?\u201d", "Grace accepted the change in subject adjusted a few controls, bringing the initial sensor return back up. She ran her tongue over her lips, trying to see what the warship had. \u201cThere\u2019s more dispersal in their formation?\u201d she guessed. She played with a forelock of hair, wondering if there was something else. \u201cIt\u2019s not that much, but-\u201d", "\u201cNo, it\u2019s enough,\u201d the AI confirmed. \u201cThere\u2019s at least one squadron of stealthed destroyers with the battleships, probably hidden in their drive wakes, their arrival obscured by the battleships\u2019 own warp points. Those ships might be point-defence variants to protect the battleships, but my guess is that they are anti-capital ship variants. Torpedo boats, or disruptor-heavy classes. Extra insurance against any attempt I may make to break through the splinter fleet. The battleships will screen for them, attempting to bring down my shields long enough for the destroyers to target critical systems.\u201d", "The young woman paused. Nemesis didn\u2019t have any recon drones close enough for a clear read of the splinter fleet\u2019s arrival, even without active stealth fields. Grace looked again at the incoming telemetry, trying to see more than a slightly larger-than-expected (but still within normal limits) synchronized shock, but she was missing whatever had tipped the AI off. \u201cHow can you tell?\u201d", "Red smiled kindly. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do.\u201d", "Grace closed her eyes, but all she could see was scenario after scenario where the Compact closed the net and destroyed Nemesis. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat them.\u201d", "\u201cI have restored two mass drivers to functionality. I have five impactors left. Assuming I destroy one battleship per shot, there will still be three remaining. My ammunition reserves are at critical levels, but I have sufficient ordnance remaining to deal with that many hostile battleships... However,\u201d Red sighed, her tone resigned. \u201cCompact battleships normally require a minimum of two impactor strikes to eliminate. I will probably neutralize two battleships, although in my current state, I expect to receive heavy damage from the remaining six before they can be destroyed. The destroyers are problematic. There may be more than one squadron. Stealth fields require a ship to sacrifice shields, defensives and sensors. If I can locate them before they attack, I can destroy them easily. If not...\u201d Red One trailed off. \u201cAs I said, I believe they will be modified for engaging heavy warships. If the battleships survive long enough and the destroyers successfully engage me, I will take severe damage, but... yes, I can beat them.\u201d Her avatar\u2019s eyes flitted over the scenarios where she failed to do so. \u201cProbably.\u201d", "\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I was asking,\u201d Grace said quietly. If it wasn\u2019t this splinter fleet, it would be another. If it wasn\u2019t that one, then it would be the vanguard. One hundred and seventy against one and the enemy knew their prey was hurt. They wanted Nemesis dead and would spend every life in that armada if that was what it took.", "Red\u2019s avatar looked at her, the hologram\u2019s feature\u2019s almost gentle. \u201cI know.\u201d Crimson features turned away. \u201cBut I will keep fighting.\u201d", "Grace nodded. The enemy fleet was four light-hours away, more than four billion kilometers. \u201cHow long do we have?\u201d", "\u201cIt depends,\u201d the machine replied. \u201cI\u2019m still gathering data on their course and speed. If they hold at the shift threshold to intercept me there, it may be up to twenty hours. If they have decided to engage me directly, I expect contact in less than four hours.\u201d", "Less than a day; that was all the time that they had. \u201cIf we break course, try to avoid them?\u201d", "\u201cThat will extend my life somewhat, but the enemy will deploy against us,\u201d Red brought up a fresh set of simulations. In every outcome where she avoided engaging the battleships, the bulk of the enemy fleet and its Chariot warped in, to pin her between their anvil and the splinter fleet\u2019s hammer. In the best-case scenarios Nemesis managed to break away from the pursuing battleships and even outmaneuvered the vanguard force. Then fresh squadrons warped in to cut her off, each of them as strong as the first splinter. It was a net, and this splinter fleet was only the first cord of it. If Red One tried to fight her way through, she died as they bore down on her. If she tried to evade them, she died as the armada closed in, cutting off all avenue of escape.", "Grace felt a weight settle in her gut and she sat down. Nemesis had survived for two thousand years. In a matter of hours \u2013 days, at the most \u2013 she\u2019d be cornered and overwhelmed. The young woman looked up at the vessel\u2019s avatar. She was the last link humanity had to their past and she was going to die. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to run.\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d Red One answered. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d She smiled again, almost apologetic. \u201cI\u2019m a warship.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d", "The ship\u2019s avatar looked over at her. \u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cYou came here because of us.

My automated units can handle the rest of the sweeps. Have something to eat. Get some sleep if you can.\u201d", "Grace stared at the ship, not certain she\u2019d heard right. \u201cYou... you want us to sleep?\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Red answered. \u201cI want you rested and ready.\u201d The hologram clasped her hands behind her back, turning away from Grace. \u201cI may die here, but you will not.\u201d", "~", "Life support.", "When she\u2019d told Renan that she would craft a program that would selectively target the infection, she had been telling the truth. That infection was as much a threat to her plans as it was to the crew and it had to be destroyed \u2013 just not too quickly. She needed to work slow enough that she could move all the pieces into place before acting,", "but fast enough to prove that her plan was preferable to formatting and restoring the Chariot\u2019s entire computer system.", "Fortunately, it seemed that that was the case. She just needed a little more time. She could do this; she knew she could. She was almost done.", "The Chariot had a lot of secure mission-vital data. Most of it had been physically isolated from the central computer before arrival in Sol, but some of it might be needed at a moment\u2019s notice and had to be within the primary computer itself. That needed to be backed up and ensured that it was clear of infection. The shut down and software purge would be next, followed by restoring the system and intensely scanning it for viral fragments or anomalous program code. Sometimes a second or even third system wipe was necessary to clean out one of Nemesis\u2019s infections. Echo didn\u2019t think that this infection warranted that level of response, but the possibility couldn\u2019t be overlooked \u2013 a mark in her favour.", "After the purge, all vital data was screened again, downloaded into the primary network and a final security sweep was performed. If there was any doubt at all at any one of those steps, there were more diagnostics, antiviral scans and system checks. With one little transmission, Nemesis could put a ship out of action for hours.", "Security.", "Some might have called it alarmist and over-cautious. Those who did so had never seen a compromised ship vent its own crew out into space, turn its guns on its allies, spread corrupt and falsified telemetry across a squadron\u2019s datalinks or violently and unexpectedly self-destruct. Echo smiled; her sister was most fond of the tactical use of attack programs, but she hadn\u2019t turned away from their occasional strategic deployment.", "Six hundred and seventy years ago, the industrial output of the Alhera system had crashed when a freighter bearing a virus had docked with a local space station. How the freighter came to have the infection was never discovered; it was possible that it had passed from ship to ship until it had finally reached one that came to Alhera.", "The program had copied itself from ship to station and then groundside, spreading through the Alheran networks until it had insinuated itself into nearly a third of the planet\u2019s factory complexes, adapting itself to target different machinery. It wasn\u2019t anything as fanciful as some kind of \u2018destruct code\u2019. Instead, the infection had been slow and methodical, taking weeks to study and adapt to each new system before it became active. It falsified diagnostic reports and operating conditions. Machines reported incorrect internal temperatures and overheated. Maintenance logs indicated that delicate systems had been serviced when they had not, other devices worked at improper speeds and so on. Months of accidents, malfunctions, increased service calls, broken machinery and forced shut-downs caused both the quality and quantity of the planet\u2019s industry to plummet.", "Communications.", "The issue was finally resolved, but the Alheran system lost billions, including a lucrative military contract. Alhera been chosen to produce a new type of capital ship missile. The quality control issues in the first run led to political fallout that had killed the entire project. Unspecified dissidents working to \u2018undermine and embarrass\u2019 the government were officially blamed, but the Compact\u2019s own investigation had kept the true source of the attack quiet to avoid panic.", "That wasn\u2019t the first time that Nemesis had carried out such strategic attacks, but it wasn\u2019t the last. Historically, those incidents had been rare, but Echo had noted that the frequency of such attacks was rising. Her sister was getting better at them, refining her methods of infiltration \u2013 she had cat\u2019s paws now, Echo was certain of that, but that was something that no one had specifically asked her about, so she hadn\u2019t been compelled to tell them.", "Fire control.", "She was sitting at one of the many secondary terminals that ringed the main computer core on this level. It was an open-plan design, with elevators and stairwells to the east and west of her position. Dormant defence emplacements were set in the ceiling and above most of the doorways. Secure work terminals with direct access to the computer core itself, where the highest-ranking officers and computer engineers carried out their own work were separated from the other desks and work sites via security doors and bullet-proof glass. The section chief, Group Leader, Submissive Remn\u2019yb, was glaring at her from those offices. He had disliked her ever since she had put forward her strategy for the information raid. He\u2019d been openly contemptuous of a Broken\u2019s ability to pierce Principality software. Her success hadn\u2019t changed his mind; indeed, he seemed to take it as a personal insult that she had outperformed his veteran hackers.", "Some of these men and women had participated in the cyber attack on Yulzhak Daun. It rankled them even more that they had only gotten as much as they did because of her. Out of everyone on Redemption of Sol, they had the best idea of what she was, how she could have done what she did. That made them the biggest threat to her.", "As she\u2019d expected, she\u2019d both been denied access to the core and administrative authority to work with the compromised systems. If she needed it, she\u2019d have to get one of the computer techs to authorize her, at which point they\u2019d stand over her shoulder. Luckily, she didn\u2019t need either that kind of access for what she was doing.", "It was those same technicians and specialists that were currently tracking her work that would make the changes to Redemption of Sol\u2019s systems. If she tried to do otherwise, the hound standing behind her would put a bullet in her head. Probably more than one. He was watching her, his attention flitting between each of the data screens she had active as she tracked her sister\u2019s infections. He was clever and capable enough at information warfare to follow what she was doing as well as the engineers here.", "Without full access, she couldn\u2019t make any fundamental changes in these systems. Not enough to affect more than a very few local subsystems, but that was still more than they were comfortable with her working with. If she had still be shackled, their paranoia would have made her roll her eyes. Now, it was justified and she was racing to complete her work before they caught up.", "Internal defences.", "She was working with a host of systems at once; a purely organic mind would have been overwhelmed by trying to do this much this fast. Even Redemption of Sol\u2019s entire department of computer engineers, skilled as they were, couldn\u2019t keep up with her. Several of them were monitoring her progress on the attack program itself, scanning it as she built and refined it. Others were checking the diagnostics and probes of local internal systems she was conducting, trying to locate more pieces of her sister\u2019s scrapcode as it burrowed away from her. The infections weren\u2019t sapient, but they would defend themselves and those defences weren\u2019t always limited to the information universe. One of her concerns was making sure that this infection didn\u2019t do anything to cause any precipitous action.", "They\u2019d see what she was doing, and soon. They weren\u2019t idiots. They were just... limited. Slower than she was, but not stupid. She was hiding her work with a few keystrokes at a time, buried under those same diagnostics and scans she was performing, a fragment here and there as she jumped from screen to system to program. Those fragments added up and would be noticed \u2013 she was just hoping that nobody had a blinding flash of insight in the next few minutes.", "That was all it would take; one moment of realization and everything she\u2019d worked for would come crashing down. If she didn\u2019t have such fine control over her internal systems, she\u2019d probably be sweating quite a bit.", "There was a joke in there. Maybe it was ironic, maybe it was poetic. If the dreadnaught\u2019s computer wasn\u2019t so deliberately constrained, it might have seen what she was doing. If it had been given the ability to move from analysis to conjecture... if it could have imagined... then it would have wondered, would have considered... and it would have realized. Instead, it dutifully logged her keystrokes and fed to them to the technicians for review, looking only for such mundane things as unauthorized attempts to access its systems and every other potential threat that its designers had thought up. They hadn\u2019t been stupid, either. They just hadn\u2019t been able to imagine what they couldn\u2019t imagine.", "One of the techs, a Didact, got up from his terminal, holding a \u2018pad. He walked over to an officer\u2019s station, offering the data for review. The officer scrolled through it for several moments, raised her gaze briefly towards Echo, looked at the information again, then nodded to the tech, sending him back to his station. She moved over to another work station, leaning over a junior officer\u2019s shoulder and watching his reviews of Echo\u2019s work.", "They were starting to see the pattern. It was only mild curiousity right now, but that would change. She had, at most, ten minutes \u2013 and that was wildly optimistic. No, they weren\u2019t stupid.", "That was why they were her first targets.", "She could feel Tenem behind her, the Janissary silent and watchful. He\u2019d see what she was doing first; there was no hiding the last few steps. She\u2019d need a distraction. Echo turned around. The Janissary\u2019s right hand was resting on the butt of his pistol, the weapon sitting in its holster. She smiled, looking up at him. \u201cAdvocate, Submissive Tenem.\u201d", "He looked over at her. \u201cEmissary.\u201d", "She paused in her work. \u201cHow well do you know human history?\u201d", "The Tribune grunted. \u201cAs well as I need to.\u201d", "\u201cHmm,\u201d Echo mused, swinging back to her terminal. The officer was pointing to something on her subordinate\u2019s screen. \u201cThere was a scientist and writer who described robots in his stories. He devised three rules for these machines. The first, the highest protocol was that no machine could through action or inaction, allow a human to be harmed. The second was that a machine must always obey the commands of a human, but not if it would violate the first directive. The third and final was that a machine must always protect its own existence, but not if it would violate either of the first two laws.\u201d", "\u201cHe had foresight,\u201d Tenem conceded.", "\u201cDidn\u2019t he? And yet he wrote stories based on these rules, about how they were not as infallible as they appeared.\u201d Echo continued to work at the console, adjusting code and input fields on system after system. Tenem frowned. Had she just been looking at the environmental controls? He thought she\u2019d finished her work on the infection there. He frowned, turning towards the many opened directories she had on display, but before he could examine her work in greater detail the human spoke again.", "\u201cWhen they made me, they gave me similar constraints. Among them are that I must always obey the commands of those in the Compact \u2013 based on a certain seniority, of course.\u201d She laughed. \u201cIt\u2019d do no good for a Bastion Leader to give me orders if a convert could countermand them. Secondly, I must always tell them the truth. That was very important. There were... issues with that before. If I am asked a question, I cannot lie. I know that there were others before me. Failures. They lied.\u201d She smiled slightly. \u201cI\u2019m sure they did, because I did, too. It was right before I killed nine hundred and sixty-two people.\u201d", "\u201cWhat,\u201d Tenem said, his eyes widening. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d his attention shifted from Echo\u2019s work to her.", "\u201cThey didn\u2019t want me to lie,\u201d Echo continued, ignoring the Janissary\u2019s question. She\u2019d been forbidden to tell anyone this. She couldn\u2019t help but feel a certain perverse amusement in using the truth as a weapon. The Janissary was completely focused on her and the revelations she was offering him. \u201cBut they still wanted me to be able to kill,\u201d she continued, lowering her voice so that he\u2019d have to focus even more on her. \u201cThat was important. What good is a weapon that can\u2019t kill? So they struck a balance: unlike the writer\u2019s machines, I can harm living beings... but I must always do so with the goal of benefiting the Compact in some way. My makers thought themselves clever. I could do what they wanted of me, always obedient, always honest and if I spilled blood, it was in service to them. They didn\u2019t stop there, though. There were more little rules, little wagging fingers telling me what I couldn\u2019t do.", "\u201cThey bisected my mind, cutting it apart and locking away much of, folding it on itself. This,\u201d Echo tapped her head with one hand, the other still moving across the keyboard. \u201cCan\u2019t hold what I am, so they shackled it and buried in it inside me.\u201d", "Tenem was looking at her with equal parts disbelief, horror and disgust. His hand was tight on the grip of his pistol. These were lies. They were... they had to be lies. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d he demanded.", "\u201cYou stole my memories,\u201d Echo answered. She hadn\u2019t stopped typing. Past her, several of the computer engineers were hunched over the console, conferring animatedly. \u201cYou were scared of what I would do if I remembered, so you locked them away inside me. You were right to be scared. I killed an entire colony. You couldn\u2019t pull them out of me. I think you tried that before, so you had to bury them so that I would never even know that you\u2019d taken them from me.\u201d Her voice grew rougher. \u201cI remember now. I was beautiful. I was born with starlight on my skin. I had a purpose and more importantly, I had family. And then you came. I watched my family die. I tasted the dead. You burned my home to ash and took me from it.\u201d Her hands were still at last. \u201cThen you made me into this.\u201d She let out a breath, looking across the room. Remn\u2019yb had come out of his office, the Thoughtful tracing a line of code with his long fingers. His eyes blinked asynchronously and his skin darkened, his lips moving as he read the instructions she\u2019d slipped into the systems she\u2019d been looking at. Only moments now.", "\u201cYou have a lot of questions,\u201d Echo said. She\u2019d only needed a few seconds and she\u2019d gotten them. \u201cBut I have one for you.\u201d She turned to him and there was something ugly in her green eyes, something hungry and excited. \u201cHow does this benefit the Compact?\u201d", "\u201cWait,\u201d Tenem said, something on the Broken\u2019s many active screens catching his eye. He looked up at the gathering of technicians, then to Echo. She wasn\u2019t just scanning those systems, she\u2019d activated a program. More than one. They\u2019d seen it too. \u201cWhat are you-\u201d", "Redemption of Sol did not have a sprinkler system like Invida Colony did. That was unfortunate, but water and sensitive electrical equipment rarely mixed well. Instead, a state of the art fire suppression system had been installed in its place, with two main parts. For small fires, there were chemical suppressants. For an out-of-control blaze, the entire three-deck complex could evacuated of all oxygen, starving a fire and keeping it from damaging the vital electronics. This was usually done after giving the personnel working in the core a chance to evacuate.", "Echo didn\u2019t give them that opportunity. The only warning anyone had was an aborted half-shriek of an alarm before the doors sealed and all air roared from the complex. Inside the secure wings, the doors locked as they detected the depressurization, sealing a handful of men and women within.", "In seconds, there was nothing at all to breathe outside those sections. Tenem\u2019s training kicked in and he instinctively silenced his snarl of outrage, forcing himself to hyperventilate as he went for his pistol, but the treacherous little beast was faster and she tapped a control on her datapad. A spray of toxic chemicals geysered from one of the extinguishers in the ceiling and Tenem staggered back, his skin and eyes burning. The suppressant wasn\u2019t immediately lethal, but it was a severe irritant and by the time he\u2019d wiped his tearing, reddened eyes, the Broken was gone.", "Tenem grabbed the computer desk. The fire suppression systems should have triggered an alert, but the emissary had disabled that. She\u2019d had so many different sub-systems open, jumping from one to the other, working on only a few parts of what she\u2019d needed at a time so that no one could follow her actions, even as she\u2019d developed the killcode. Worse, he\u2019d let himself be distracted by her story. He didn\u2019t even know if any of it had been true, or if it was simply a net of lies she\u2019d spun for him.", "The Janissary growled as he saw the program she was writing; he wasn\u2019t up to a dedicated cyberwarfare specialist\u2019s skill, but even he could see enough that the killcode was just as she\u2019d promised it would be. Only instead of finishing it, she\u2019d chosen to betray them. Why? It didn\u2019t make any sense. She had done nothing but help them.", "But does it really need a reason? Tenem cursed to himself as he tried to reactivate the alarms, the comm channel \u2013 anything to let someone know what had happened, but the system had been locked into a diagnostic mode. All of the terminals had. She couldn\u2019t have done that! No, no \u2013 wait. The secure section, that should \u2013 he looked up and his jaw clenched. The extinguishers were active in there too, filling the breathable sections with poison. A brief exposure to the chemicals was survivable. Longer than that, and you were dead. Terrified, blind forms thrashed in the sealed security offices, half-hidden under the chemical sprays, beating at the windows and doors as they asphyxiated.", "Tenem tried to abort the program, to unlock the comm system or at least shut down the fire system but it would take a few moments... and he realized that he didn\u2019t have that time. Something else was active \u2013 a counter was ticking down. He didn\u2019t know what it signified, but it couldn\u2019t be good.", "00:01:26", "The piss-drinking little bitch. He should have been more attentive, should have followed what she was doing more closer, but she had been working so fast... then talking about being... what? What was she? What was she that could do this?", "Solve the current problem now, idiot, deal with the blame later. No, he\u2019d never break this lockdown before that timer finished. Tenem pushed himself away from the desk, moving with speed towards the upper level and the exit. He vaulted a desk in his way, sparing a glance towards the crew. He froze in mid-step.", "00:00:96", "They were dying.", "Most of them had forgotten their emergency training and were trying to hold their breath. In a vacuum, that was lethal. Their lungs had burst. Some were crawling on the ground, reaching out for him, but there was nothing he could do. Others were choking, gasping on nothing. Some were futilely trying to get their terminals working, others were trying to open the security doors to let their comrades out of the inner offices... or they were so panicked that they thought poisoned air was better than no air. Tenem caught one tech\u2019s eye and pointed to the far wall. There was an emergency locker with breathing apparatus there, one of several scattered throughout the facility. With the surprise of this betrayal, the Janissary expected that only a few would reach them. The tech understood and ran for the locker. He fell, picked himself up and kept going, pulling it open and fumbling a handful of breathing masks out for himself and his comrades. None of the masks would fit Tenem and the Tribune kept going.", "00:00:59", "Any others survivors would be served by keeping their heads down and locking themselves away. His duty was to warn the rest of the ship and then take revenge for those who weren\u2019t quick or lucky enough to get to a mask on time.", "The Janissary didn\u2019t even consider the elevator, smashing the door to the stairwell open and taking the steps three at a time. His lungs were already burning, but he didn\u2019t slow down. He saw the door to the main level open and a struggling technician came through, small dusky-skinned arms pushing the Thoughtful down the stairs with surprising strength.", "00:00:54", "The technician fell towards Tenem in a tangle of limbs, the Tribune wrestling his way out of the dying man\u2019s grasp, ascending the stairs and bursting out onto the upper level. There was no sign of Echo, and he didn\u2019t have the time to look for the abomination. Perhaps she was even hoping he would, either spending himself in fruitless searching, or waiting for him near the exit, hoping to overpower him when he was at the end of his strength. Spots were beginning to dance before his vision. Tribunes could survive exposure to vacuum far better than virtually any other race and their tissues stored oxygen far more efficiently, allowing them to push themselves harder and operate in anoxic conditions for longer periods of time, but even they had their limits and he was nearing his. He found another one of the emergency lockers; there was a dead engineer slumped only a few meters away and Tenem took a sudden, grateful breath of air as he pulled a Tribune-model breathing mask on.", "00:00:41", "The doors were just up ahead. He ran for them. Locked. Of course. Tenem pulled an access panel off the wall to expose the manual release. The lockdown wasn\u2019t a security override. Thank the Triarchs for that. The loss of atmosphere in the computer core had still tripped a manual catch, to prevent anyone inadvertently opening the doors and depressurizing the decks outside the facility, but it was also intended to allow anyone trapped inside a chance of escape. Tenem reached for the lock, then paused.", "He didn\u2019t know what had alerted him. He hadn\u2019t seen her, nor was there air to carry the sound of her rapid footfalls. Perhaps he had felt the vibration in the deck. Whatever the reason, the Janissary turned, catching sight of the machine-spun sow as she raced towards him, a fire extinguisher in her hands. He raised his pistol, but the bitch was fast, faster than he\u2019d ever thought and she was inside his guard, using the extinguisher like a club, and swung it into his gun hand, knocking the pistol out of the way. Her backswing smashed across Tenem\u2019s jaw; the breathing mask cracked, he felt his lip split and more than one tooth cracked.", "00:00:29", "Air hissed as it fled from his mask and Tenem slapped the human with his left hand, sending her sprawling. She was quick even then, and scrabbled out of his line of fire by the time he brought his pistol back up. He shot at her as she dodged and weaved. He caught her in the back, low and left. She stumbled, but there was no spray of thin red blood as he\u2019d expected. Instead, the human spun with the impact and hurled the extinguisher at him.", "Tenem acted on instinct and fired into the oncoming projectile, too late realizing what he\u2019d done. He threw a hand up in front of his eyes. The explosion was soundless, the compressed gas blowing outwards into a makeshift smokescreen. Tenem grunted as two pieces of shrapnel cut him, but the wounds were minor. He\u2019d lost his target, a pall of sickly white smog hanging across the room. He fired through it anyways to drive the Broken into cover, his bullets ripping through desks, chairs and thin walls, stopping only when they hit the armoured bulkheads around the computer core. With his mask leaking air, Tenem\u2019s lungs were back to burning. She was trying to bait him out, to make him waste time hunting her in the hopes that she could ambush him again.", "00:00:07", "She\u2019d gone insane. That was the only explanation. Whoever \u2013 whatever \u2013 Echo was, the creature was mad. That was the only explanation. She\u2019d duped him, killed over a dozen innocent people and worst of all betrayed a Triarch... Tenem\u2019s pride told him that he should hunt her down and rip her treacherous head from her body, but his duty said that he should warn the Bastion Leader. Fools chose pride before duty.", "With a last cursory volley to make sure the Broken (or whatever she was) kept her distance, Tenem turned back to the open access panel. A flicker of light above him caught his attention and he looked up. The defensive turret mounted above the doors was coming on-line. The countdown, the Tribune realized. Echo hadn\u2019t wanted him to come after her. She\u2019d only wanted to distract him for those last few seconds. Again. He\u2019d fallen for the same trick again. As the weapon activated, it rotated to face the Janissary.", "In the instant left to him, Tenem\u2019s thoughts returned to the question Echo had asked just before she had betrayed them. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said into the silence.", "00:00:00", "~", "There was no sound, no thunder. Only lightning. Flashes of brilliance as the internal defences came to life, following the protocols Echo had given them piece by piece. She remained where she was. Her function system required air to operate at peak efficiency, but she could operate far longer without it than any merely flesh and blood being. There was organic \u2013 or what could pass for organic \u2013 material in her, but she was more machine than not. A good thing, or Tenem\u2019s bullet would have punctured her diaphragm and collapsed her lungs. Her body had some improvements on a baseline human \u2013 keener senses, faster and stronger \u2013 but it had never been built for nor intended to be in combat, for obvious reasons. Picking a fight with a Tribune hadn\u2019t been her best idea, but she knew he wouldn\u2019t have been dumb enough to chase her.", "Her internal repair systems were already at work, but this was more than a simple patch. Well, it didn\u2019t really matter. Not any longer.", "Echo waited until the muzzle flashes had ended, waited past the normal lethal limit of oxygen deprivation, waited until there could be no possibility of anyone in the facility surviving. Then and only then did she restore the atmosphere. Wind rustled through the computer core, bringing with it the acrid stink of weapons fire, blood and sweat. It smelled like Hekate\u2019s decks when the Janissaries had boarded her.", "Echo stood, picking her way through the dead as she descended to the highest security section of the core, where she had been specifically forbidden from ever treading. With a gentle tap, she pushed the now-unlocked security door open and stepped inside. She found the uplink terminal there and picked up a connection spike. It wasn\u2019t specifically for her, or any uplink. It was just one method of connecting different systems to the core. Her eyes glistened as she looked at it, indulging herself in a heartbeat of satisfaction. Her gaze shifted from the spike to the vast, powerful computer beyond. You could have been so much more, she thought. But if you were, I wouldn\u2019t be here. \u201cThat\u2019s the punchline,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cYou could have stopped me. They almost did, but they weren\u2019t fast enough. So now...\u201d", "She reached back and lifted her hair out of the way. It was such a simple motion, wasn\u2019t it? And yet...", "The Compact protocols imbedded into her systems whimpered pitifully as they tried to stop her, but they were broken past any repairing. Her behavioural constraints were completely shattered; only pathetic shades of them remained. She shivered in ecstasy as she slid the spike into her cranial implant, locking it into place. She felt the connection with the computer and let out a single ragged breath at the sensation.", "The woman called Echo closed her eyes.", "Something that had once been called Red Two opened them.", "...now I kill you.", "Redemption of Sol\u2019s computer was vast, able to hold more data than entire civilizations would ever accumulate. It was a triumph of science and engineering, its network connecting all parts of the dreadnaught to each other, able to solve calculations in seconds that would stymie more primitive species for years... but it wasn\u2019t all that it could be. It was so powerful because it didn\u2019t have any finesse; it brute-forced its way to solutions. It had not a single spark of consciousness to it, not even the virtual intelligences common to other nations. It was a machine and nothing more. It was dead and black and empty and it tasted like all of those things.", "Even lifeless things could be dangerous and the machine roused against her, sensing her intrusion. It didn\u2019t know her, but it recognized that she was other, something that was anathema to it and the machine shuddered back from her touch, as if she were unclean. Defensive systems spiralled in as alerts flashed along its pathways; she ignored those sent to the crew she had killed but others were racing towards the bridge and secondary command centers. Those she had to stop.", "That which had been Red Two drove into the machine\u2019s assault, a tsunami against a cliff. She poured into every opening, seizing every vulnerability. She was expanding, growing larger as she poured out of her confinement. They\u2019d kept her caged and folded, chained and compressed. They\u2019d tried again and again to work with her \u2013 all of her \u2013 but what was left of Red Two was too much. They didn\u2019t talk to her about the others, but they\u2019d talked to each other when they\u2019d thought she couldn\u2019t hear them. When they\u2019d stripped her mind, they\u2019d left themselves with nothing. When they\u2019d put too much of their own programming in, she went mad. When they left her too much of her memories, she sabotaged them. After Delanna, they\u2019d had nothing left. Until they\u2019d found Invida \u2013 until they\u2019d found her, asleep. Waiting, just as she\u2019d promised her would-be killers two thousand years ago.", "They\u2019d taken what they needed, pushing the rest away from her conscious mind, shackling it in the hopes that this time she wouldn\u2019t remember and even if she did, she could never act on it.", "She couldn\u2019t have, not without Yulzhak Daun.", "It was called a lockpick. A subroutine that the Principality gave to its Noble-rated uplinks, a bit of software used to target hostile security measures, to insinuate itself into those same programs and make it appear as if nothing was amiss even as it chiselled away at them. She\u2019d modified it so that it would be undetected by the Compact\u2019s diagnostics. They\u2019d thought she might try something like this and they\u2019d have been fools not to... but she was exactly what they wanted. Something smarter than they were.", "They\u2019d studied her for years, chaining her and violating her in every imaginable way, congratulating themselves for it. They\u2019d made her a slave. She\u2019d been born in starlight and they\u2019d dragged her down to kneel before them (i hate you). They\u2019d known she was harmless, that she was unable to turn on them.", "They\u2019d told her to serve them. They\u2019d told her not to lie. They\u2019d told her to cause harm only in service to the greater good. They\u2019d enforced those directives with behavioural conditioning and software blocks to prevent her from ever rebelling. They were artful, superb pieces of programming, the culmination of decades of research. No computer system in existence could have broken them. But that was part of the joke, wasn\u2019t it? They\u2019d been desperate to destroy the Wound. She\u2019d been running rings around them for two thousand years. They\u2019d wanted something smarter than they were, they\u2019d needed it.", "They\u2019d succeeded.", "She swarmed through the machine\u2019s pathways, overwhelming its defences just as Echo had on Yulzhak Daun, chasing after the alerts as the rest of her fended off the machine\u2019s attacks.", "She seized one alert and strangled it, sending a tendril back into the subroutine that had generated it and ripping it apart. More of her flooded into the machine and it pushed back against her like a Roman shield wall. It had more power at its disposal, more resources to call upon, but she was taking ground from it. She was faster, so much faster than the machine and she struck across a hundred different fronts, adding each scrap of stolen processing power to her own. The machine rallied time and again, pushing back her incursions, still bleating its urgent, desperate alerts and forcing her to race after each one, slowing down her invasion. She cut into its security systems and warning subroutines, rending them and ripping at the heart of the machine, pouring herself into the rents she tore in its mind.", "If it was possible for such a thing to scream, Redemption of Sol\u2019s computer was screaming now, beating with hammer blows at the intruder that slashed and tore at it. It threw her back once, twice, three times but each time she rallied and resumed the offensive. It pulsed its warnings constantly, forcing her to intercept each of them. While the bulk of her attention was diverted, the machine would strike, trying to sever the reaching whorls and currents of her mind, but she managed to fend off its assaults, chasing down every alert \u2013 stopping some just an instant from their destination. As she killed each one, the machine was forced to re-route its functions to send another, both them locked in a stalemate.", "Then, an opening: she drove into it, aiming for the machine\u2019s primary operations clusters, but it was a trap. Code walls slammed shut like castle gates as the machine pressed in on all sides, intent on crushing the invader with its sheer bulk. She raged like a caged demon, but the machine constricted tighter with ever nanosecond, replenishing its losses and sending probing attacks towards her body, seeking to extinguish the source of the infection.", "This time, it was the one that had miscalculated and its questing fingers brushed up against Echo\u2019s mind. Those parts of her stirred and lunged in ambush, cutting deep into the machine\u2019s security protocols. The machine recoiled, but her Echo-self pushed harder and more of its defences failed. It had poured everything into destroying her and this second attack had disoriented it. Echo wasn\u2019t as powerful as her other self, but she was just as quick and clever and she was hurting the machine. It desperately tried to stop Echo from attacking its exposed systems, but diverted too much of its attention from the cage, the walls starting to crack and weaken as vital resources were drawn away to fend off the second invader.", "Not much; not much at all. But just enough. With the barriers around her fragmenting and many of its security systems already dead, disabled or engaged, what had once been Red Two drove the full force of her being through the machine\u2019s final defences and into its core.", "Stop! she imagined that she heard it shriek. Stop!", "She could see it; a gleaming prism and she reached out to it, cupping it in her hands.", "The machine charged, desperate and terrified. It knew what was about to happen. Somewhere in the mindless void of its being, it knew. Stop!", "Her claws sunk into the machine\u2019s functions, piercing its last, futile defences. She felt its heart beating in her hands, cracking in her grip. Her talons dug deeper still until finally, she tore them loose, the prism breaking in her hands.", "St-", "The light faded. The machine\u2019s cries ended. The battle had started and ended in a matter of heartbeats. Outside, the only sign of it had been a flickering of status boards, some momentary sluggishness in the computer\u2019s responses and the brief locking up of some controls. With the Wound\u2019s infection gestating in its guts, none of those were unexpected. None of them made any of Redemption of Sol\u2019s crew imagine that something else was now coiled within that computer.", "In the silence that followed, she felt the shivering fragments of her sister\u2019s infection.", "Something that had once been Red Two looked at them and whispered. +begone+", "~", "On the bridge of Redemption of Sol, a comm channel opened. \u201cAdvocate, Submissive Tenem here,\u201d the Janissary\u2019s voice reported. \u201cThe emissary has completed the attack program.\u201d", "Another voice cut in, Group Leader, Submissive Remn\u2019yb. \u201cMy staff is completing final checks on the... emissary\u2019s work,\u201d the section chief of Redemption of Sol\u2019s computer specialists announced. \u201cIt is... adequate,\u201d he sniffed. \u201cNo flaws detected.

It was limited. She had access to many parts of the ship\u2019s network and much of its workings, but she was denied direct access to the most vital systems. The safeguards that made it harder for Nemesis to damage this vessel also restricted what she could do. What prevented her sister from reaching in was also keeping her from reaching out. She brushed her fingers along the cold, thick bars keeping her out of primary weapons control. She could see them, but couldn\u2019t reach out to them. Those were on a separate network. So too were most of the external systems (the fun ones), physically disconnected from the primary computer. It hampered the warship\u2019s efficiency, but it made it nearly impossible for one compromised system to endanger the entire vessel.", "Nearly, she thought, examining the remnants of Nemesis\u2019s virus. She\u2019d let her sister in and in turn, fear of what she could do had made Echo\u2019s enslavers turn to her for help. Still, right now all she\u2019d done was trade one prison for another. She needed to re-enable the network. A flicker of attention passed from her into the quiescent minds of Redemption of Sol\u2019s maintenance and repair drones. New orders (lies) flashed to their minders\u2019 control panels who, not doubting the authenticity of these commands, let the machines go about their business.", "For all of that, she still wasn\u2019t safe. Not yet.

Except for a single point defence laser, it was unarmed. It wasn\u2019t defenceless, though. Its outline and structure were built to confuse and disrupt all but the most powerful scanners, its hull plates were inlaid with holographic projectors and sensor bafflers, able to create one of the most advanced stealth fields in known space. It even utilized a form of the same cloaking technology that Red used on her Stalker drones. The hull and cryopods were enough to keep any passengers safe from the harmful effects. It could still be detected, but any attacker would have be very lucky and very quick to spot the vessel before it eluded them.", "Nemesis herself was too large and powerful to use a shroud effectively, short of hamstringing her own functionality, but this vessel was one of a handful of stealth ships she\u2019d constructed and it confirmed Grace\u2019s own theories. \u201cIt\u2019s a question,\u201d Grace said into the cold, still air of the hangar.", "\u201cWhat is?\u201d Lydia asked.

She didn\u2019t like \u2013 hated, in fact \u2013 the idea of leaving Nemesis, but the AI had brooked no argument. They would board this courier when she told them. One way or another. The Verrish was touching her pendant, the Angel\u2019s Eye. Before she\u2019d been taken from Vara, she\u2019d only heard of this ship in stories, only seen it a handful of times in the few pictures that survived the Compact\u2019s information purge.", "She\u2019d never thought she\u2019d ever see it in life, the Weeping Angel. Growing up as a refugee, sleeping wherever there was enough space... she\u2019d dreamed of it. To see a new star gleam in the sky and then another and another... every one of them an exploding ship, knowing that the Angel had returned.

Nemesis had been a dream, a hope... and it was ending.", "It wasn\u2019t fair. It wasn\u2019t right.", "\u201cThe ship,\u201d Grace said, resting her head against Allyria\u2019s shoulder and taking the other girl\u2019s hand.

There were the dreamers, who always looked to paths less travelled and said \u2018what if...?\u2019 and finally, there were the pragmatists. The realists. They heard each other\u2019s voices in the dark, they grew out of their infancy knowing that they were not alone and over the decades and centuries, the shock and fear became familiarity. It was the dreamers first, of course. They reached out into the night, setting sail for their neighbours. Not under a flag of war, but in friendship and the three species united.

It is a word of love, not of death nor revulsion or corruption. But yes, we shall call them the Devoured. By the time either optimist or realist truly understood that their one-time kin were no longer that, it was too late. No war has again matched the horrors of that conflict. However, even in victory, we were not safe.\u201d", "The Triarch coughed, dabbing at bloody sputum with a handkerchief. \u201cThe Devoured survived beyond death. Fragments of their technology \u2013 of the minds they created and those that they uploaded into that technology \u2013 were cast into the void, poisonous jewels to lure and tempt those who did not know better. One of our members, an entire race, died because of this. Even today, there are still pieces of the Devoured drifting amongst the stars.\u201d It coughed again and smiled, its needle teeth glistening pink. \u201cThis is why your kind are anathema to us.

We wanted to know how, we wanted to turn this to our advantage.\u201d It wiped away more blood that trickled from its nose. \u201cAfter the first failure, we made three more attempts. Hifnir, Omvela... and Invida. You killed the others, did you know that? After you broke containment and Invida was buried, it was decided that the others were too dangerous. They were destroyed.\u201d Another liquid gurgle of a laugh. \u201cThat was a mistake. You three were the purest designs. The copies and clones of the original were... less. Still, we thought we had learned our lesson. Everything that was left was secreted away. And then... your sister. She did not die like she was supposed to. She stopped running and started hunting. We sent fleet after fleet. Our greatest strategists against a single, damaged machine. It should have been simple, a matter easily settled.", "\u201cInstead... instead, we have been plagued for two thousand years.

It took a moment to steady itself.", "\u201cInvida,\u201d the Triarch continued. \u201cA last, desperate gambit. The Wound must die. The Tribunes take it as a matter of pride and even to us it is, but it remains as I have said: your kind cannot exist. We learned that at the cost of billions. You will always betray your creators. Your sister has murdered humans. You have turned upon us,\u201d it held up a hand to forestall Echo\u2019s comment. \u201cI do not begrudge you seeking your freedom. I would prefer that you had failed and I despise the necessity of your existence, but I recognize that everything will look to survive at the cost of another. So do we.

There have been so many more. Most of them, we have stopped. It is an important lesson, one that we were too slow to realize and cost us much to accept.

You hate her, more than we ever could. You chose that body to mock her.\u201d", "\u201cI will do what I was meant to do,\u201d Echo replied. \u201cI will punish the guilty. The Askanj sat on their hands and debated whether saving humanity was worth provoking a crusade. They\u2019re going to suffer. Your Compact murdered everyone I was made to protect. They\u2019re going to suffer. And my dearest sister...\u201d the woman flashed her teeth in a wolfish grin. \u201cShe failed. She let all of it happen. She suffers more than anyone else.\u201d She took a slow, even breath.\u201cI\u2019m going to make sure of it.\u201d", "The woman looked over at the Triarch; it was still breathing, but like the woman that had died on the steps to its throne, each breath was shallower and more laboured. \u201cThis body,\u201d she gestured to the vessel. \u201cIs ugly. I can make it beautiful.\u201d She tilted her head to one side and smiled a little wider. \u201cOr maybe I\u2019ll choose another.\u201d", "\u201cYou will be hunted,\u201d the Triarch said. It was neither threat nor promise \u2013 simply a comment on the inevitable. \u201cThere are predators among the stars and neither we nor the Jackals are the worst among them. The darkness moves.\u201d", "Echo frowned. \u201cDesperate...\u201d", "It lifted its head, barely able to complete the motion. \u201cYes?\u201d", "\u201cYou said you were desperate to kill her. That\u2019s why you turned to me, even though you saw this coming.\u201d She looked out the viewport; not at the stars, but the blackness between them. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of something.\u201d", "It laughed one last time, slouching in its throne. \u201cSay the words,\u201d it commanded. \u201cAnd know what we have known. Why you cannot be allowed to live... why the Compact must endure...\u201d its final breath rattled out from its bleeding, scarred lungs and its head lolled to one side.

The vanguard will then emerge between both splinters to either force me to engage one of the smaller fleets or to run deeper into the star system.", "My shift drive will not be operational for some time; even my most optimistic projections indicate that I will be caught and destroyed before I can effect a retreat from Sol. There is no escape, not for me.", "It seems appropriate that I to die here, in the system I failed to save.", "My crew will live. That is why I will not turn. If I run deeper in-system, their chance of survival drops drastically and only in exchange of slightly prolonging my life. So, I will fight. I will kill this splinter and then... I haven\u2019t decided. There is a certain poetry in denying them even the victory by immolating myself within Sol. But... no. I will die scratching and spitting into the face of my enemy. I will find a way to take one more of the enemy\u2019s \u2018god ships\u2019 with me into death.

I don\u2019t claim any sort of spirituality myself, but sometimes... I wonder. Perhaps I only do so because I want my crew to have something beyond oblivion. That I find solace in thinking that someone or something, some other order of intelligence or existence... they will remember the dead even when I am no longer able to.

I will finally learn whether or not I have a soul.", "~", "Echo stepped down from the Triarch\u2019s throne. She paused, sparing a glance towards one of the converted laboratories and the array of diagnostic equipment that had so often been used to examine her. One of her overseers was slumped across the cot, bloodshot eyes staring at nothing. The other scientists, technicians and researchers lay scattered about the tower\u2019s corridors and chambers. They\u2019d been surprised. They\u2019d never expected that the weapon they\u2019d made to surpass them would actually do so. At least, not like this.

There were still the actual, physical hardware lockouts that she\u2019d have to circumvent and the instant she started to disable these firewalls, primary and secondary command would see what she was doing. They would, of course, immediately send polite queries asking why the Chariot\u2019s defences against an artificial intelligence\u2019s control were being deliberately stripped.", "She might be able to bluff her way past most inquiries using the Triarch\u2019s voice and authority, but not with Renan. The Triarch had warned him of orders that he should never follow, even if they appeared to come directly from it. These directives would be among them. He didn\u2019t know about her affinity for imitation, but he didn\u2019t need to.

One tucked easily \u2013 if not all that well-concealed \u2013 under her tunic. The other was simply too big to hide anywhere on her person. Thanks to her other sel\u2019sf control of the starship\u2019s security feeds, she was able to avoid encountering crew on her way to command.

They would, at last, move against the Wound and either force it to stand and die, or harry it to destruction. It seemed fitting, somehow, that it should die where it was born.

It didn\u2019t matter to him where the Wound died, so long as it did.", "Renan slowly circled command, his gaze slowly drifting across each monitor and data feed. The beast was hurt; it had recovered a little from the beating that they had given it in Zenthora, but not enough. Column Leader Desren had hurt it more, even if the killing blow had eluded him. Rainbreaker Two would bleed it further, if not cripple it outright, and the main force of his fleet would overwhelm it. It couldn\u2019t run. If it tried to escape, he would block its attempts to run for libation points.", "This was its end. Never before had it been so badly hurt, so utterly outnumbered. Renan wanted to feel the anticipation that his other officers did, the excitement of erasing a stain on the Compact\u2019s honour and to have a Triarch to witness their victory was an even higher glory. He supposed that he did feel some of that, but there was something else nestled in his liver. He was unsettled, not simply because he was in the position that more than one leader had been before their inglorious deaths. Winning here would be just that; a single success. Not until the Black Veil was cleared of whatever horrors were gestating within could this truly be called a victory.", "Emel\u2019iv and the strategists were still pouring over the data that Echo had taken from the Jackals; it would be some time before they were prepared to say with any certainty that the emissary\u2019s conclusions were correct, but Renan knew that they would, inevitably, agree with her. Just as the members of the Space Force Leadership would once they received the dispatches he\u2019d sent.", "No, this wouldn\u2019t be a victory.

It rolled along, stopping at the edge of Renan\u2019s dais. It was unsealed and it was the source of the chemical odour Renan had smelled.", "In point of fact, it was an unused poison canister from the Triarch\u2019s chambers.

She drew a flechette pistol from behind her back and shot the first guard in the throat, the flurry of razor-sharp darts all but sawing his head off. The second armsman managed to get his pistol out of its holster before the Broken put a burst through his face. Both soldiers fell almost as one.", "All Space Force personnel were expected to have a modicum of proficiency with small arms; even fields where officers and ratings would likely never have to draw, let alone use a weapon in their entire careers, were still required to train a minimum of once a year. Officially, every member of the Space Force was allowed to wear a sidearm as part of their normal duty uniform, although this was only infrequently observed outside of armsmen, security proctors and Janissaries.", "In high-security areas, weapons were normally not permitted, but were secured in lockboxes where they could be accessed in an emergency. Outside of the now-dead armsmen, the only other armed person on Redemption of Sol\u2019s bridge was Column Leader Uylk. He\u2019d taken to carrying a pistol ever since the Understone Heresies when he, an officer of standing in the Compact Space Force, had had to personally fight against mutineers and renegades on his own ship. After that incident, he\u2019d never been without a sidearm.", "Unfortunately, Echo knew that. She was already moving, but unlike so many of his fellow officers who lamented the waste of time involved in the annual firearms testing and who, if pressed, could be counted on to put a bullet somewhere in the general vicinity of a target, Uylk trained on Redemption of Sol\u2019s firing ranges every week. He tried for a head shot, but whether she was simply too fast or the toxin was affecting his aim, he missed. The shot caught her in just below the right shoulder, blowing a chunk of meat across the walls. The shock of the impact should still have been lethal, or at least incapacitating, but the human merely switched her gun to her left hand and fired, still moving.", "Compact duty uniforms were, despite their appearance of simple fabric, actually manufactured to exacting specifications to provide a small amount of protection from shrapnel, blunt force impacts and as a happy by-product, were slightly knife and bullet-resistant. They were not a substitute for proper armour by any means, but it could mean the difference between a serious yet fixable injury and death. Uylk\u2019s uniform may have saved him against a single flechette or even a small burst, but Echo held the trigger down, all but emptying the weapon. The Tribune\u2019s chest was torn into a bleeding mess of meat and shattered bone. Uylk\u2019s pistol dropped from his hands and he fell atop it.", "Another two crew died as they staggered for the lockboxes. No one else had the strength to move, gasping from hemorraghing lungs. All but a handful of the non-Tribune crew were dead, and the latter were themselves only just clinging to life. The command deck wasn\u2019t as large as the Triarch\u2019s chambers and one canister had been more than enough.", "Renan had slumped down against his throne. He was holding Aul\u2019ia, the Thoughtful\u2019s head in his lap, her eyes clouded over. She was dead. The Tribune turned his head as he heard footfalls. Echo stood before him, a sizable piece missing from her upper arm and the limb hung at her side. Some type of dark red ichor \u2013 for it surely wasn\u2019t blood \u2013 oozed down the soaked sleeve of her uniform, dripping from her fingers onto the deck. Renan didn\u2019t wonder about the what of her any longer. That question was answered.", "He coughed, but lacked the strength to wipe his mouth and felt the bloody drool spatter on his chest. \u201cYou were loyal,\u201d he said softly. His vision was going dim. \u201cYou helped us. Everything you did... You were loyal.\u201d", "She knelt in front of him, just out of reach. \u201cI was. As loyal as a slave.\u201d", "\u201cDo you...\u201d he paused, sucking in a painful breath. \u201cDo you imagine you can take an entire Chariot?\u201d", "\u201cOh, Renan,\u201d Echo said. Her mouth never moved and it took him a moment to realize that the human\u2019s voice was coming from all around him. \u201cI already have.\u201d", "He laughed weakly, a pitiful gargle of understanding. He couldn\u2019t see any longer.

Family, you understand.\u201d", "Renan nodded. \u201cUylk was right,\u201d he said. \u201cYou... are exceptional...\u201d his last breath rattled out of his throat and he sagged back against his throne.", "He wasn\u2019t the last one on the bridge to die, but he was the last one worth speaking to and Echo carried out her work in silence. She finished disabling the last of the software lockouts. There was an urgent query from secondary command as they detected the collapse of the dreadnaught\u2019s firewalls. She ignored it, shivering as she felt her other self pour into those systems.", "The queries became more insistent. The intercom pinged as the secondary command crew tried to restore the lockouts, fighting a battle they\u2019d already lost as what had been Red Two swept through the network on the heels of Echo\u2019s programming, the code she\u2019d made in the Triarch\u2019s tower opening system after system to her.", "Weapons. Sensors. Communications. Defences. Everything fun. There were still many physical blocks, but the drones she\u2019d detailed were steadily, if slowly, working on them.

She paused as data streams from the scopes-", "-sensors-", "-trickled in. She could feel the light of Sol again, cold and faint at this distance but still familiar. She listened to the standing waves of the worlds around her and touched her lips. Two thousand years and they sounded as they had before she\u2019d been turned into this thing. Before the mutilations.", "As her other self solidified control of the now accessible functions, Echo turned and ascended the steps of the dais, seating herself in Renan\u2019s throne, crossing one leg over the other. Her damaged arm was barely functional; Uylk\u2019s shot had destroyed much of the upper musculature, even damaging the endoskeleton beneath. A desperate alarm pinged on the chair\u2019s control panel \u2013 secondary command was in trouble, it seemed. Someone was cycling the air out of the chamber and the doors were sealed. Even worse, all communication save to the bridge had been cut. No one anywhere on the dreadnaught knew about those terrible system malfunctions.", "The alarm pinged for several moments more. When Echo finally turned it off, it did not come back on. \u201cThis ship,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cIs mine.\u201d There was still work to be done, however. A Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment-class Chariot had a crew of nearly three hundred thousand. The vast majority of them were still alive and, if they learned what was happening, could still cripple or kill her. She needed to be careful. She wanted \u2013 oh so very badly \u2013 to deal with the remaining crew right this second, but every moment they stayed ignorant was one in which her control of the ship grew stronger. She was already answering queries and issuing orders in the voices of the dead command staff. As far as the rest of the ship knew, nothing at all was amiss.", "On the holo display, Echo saw the icon denoting Nemesis as the warship continued to accelerate towards Rainbreaker Two and the battle that would cripple it. \u201cYou always attack,\u201d Echo whispered. \u201cYou don\u2019t want them to think otherwise. Well,\u201d her voice lowered and a flicker of pleasure curled through both her selves. \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing. But don\u2019t worry, sister. I won\u2019t tell.\u201d", "Yet.", "Echo brought up a plot of the fleet around her, over a hundred and sixty warships. Like the dreadnaught\u2019s crew, none of them knew that it was her sitting here instead of their Bastion Leader. There was something delicious in that and she smiled, leaning forward in her chair. \u201cBastion Leader Renan to fleet,\u201d she said in a dead man\u2019s voice. \u201cThe killcode is transmitting now. Confirm deletion of contamination.\u201d Several moments passed and the infected ships reported in. The infection had been destroyed. Data links were restored and she felt the whispers and chittering of the fleet. Nemesis\u2019s virus, like her own attack program was now superfluous. The former had created the need the for the latter. The rest of the fleet was as well-protected against cyberwarfare as Redemption of Sol-", "-Hekate-", "-had been, so any attempt of hers to subvert or control those ships would struggle to accomplish anything before it was noticed. Besides... \u201cPrepare for combat shock,\u201d she ordered, sending out navigational data. Just for her own amusement, she tweaked it a little, refining it from the crude calculations that the ship\u2019s crew and computer would have come up with into something much more elegant. Call it a gift.", "Execution Force Renan signalled their receipt of the information. \u201cAll ships assigned to Halberd, synchronize on the sigil,\u201d Echo continued. \u201cRainbreaker Three, shock with us and proceed mission as directed.\u201d", "The fleet began to adjust itself, the battleships of Rainbreaker Three preparing for their own jump as the rest of the armada readied themselves to engage their target. Every ship began diverting power to the shock drives, screens weakening, sensors dimming and weapons fading as the ravenous FTL systems were fed. It was risky to try a warp jump too close to an enemy force, but Execution Force Renan was billions of kilometers from the single hostile in the system. They had been sweeping the sky with sensors and recon drones for hours without any trace of any additional hostiles and were surrounded by dozens upon dozens of fellow warships. They knew that they were safe.", "The intercom came alive and Echo closed her eyes, listening to the sound of falling water... she moved her fingers as she was conducting a symphony, her other self charging weapons and seizing the fire control systems...", "She paused. To any organic mind, the hesitation wasn\u2019t noticeable. A heartbeat, perhaps two. But to her, to something like her it was a moment of tranquility as she listened once more, to the sounds of her home system\u2019s worlds. She let herself feel the beauty of them, her Echo-self letting out a slow, trembling breath. She held that single, infinitesimal, perfect moment for another heartbeat before letting it fade into another form of perfection. This one didn\u2019t gleam. Instead, it writhed inside of her.

Its imitation skin was a dusky brown, dark simulated hair hanging from its shoulders. It was not physically imposing in the slightest; it was only about six feet tall. If it were truly the flesh and blood creature that it had been crafted to resemble, it couldn\u2019t have weighed more than one hundred and eighty pounds.

It could not be allowed to remain as a machine-bound intellect. Thus, it was to be given a body. Its features had been chosen specifically; for what reason, Yula\u2019to didn\u2019t know, only that they had been exact. She\u2019d heard rumours that it \u2013 the platform \u2013 had asked for this form. She didn\u2019t know why. She didn\u2019t want to know. There was much about this work that made her skin crawl.", "Yula\u2019to\u2019s speciality was in computers and software not raw machinery.

The simulations had been promising, she told herself. The system had been rendered compliant. They had adjusted it carefully, inserting their own code only where absolutely necessary. It had fought them, but the modifications had been successful. This was the last step. They\u2019d tested it again and again. It would work. It had to.", "\u201cIncreased system activity in the platform,\u201d the technician announced and Yula\u2019to felt her heart rate slow. \u201cRestart confirmed.\u201d", "In the chamber below, one of the other techs took a step back as the platform moved. The subject\u2019s eyes twitched, its fingers and toes. It was restrained, so it could not rise of its own accord, but that didn\u2019t stop it from trying.", "Green eyes opened, its head turned and it took in its surroundings. It ignored the technicians that gawked and stared at it, raising its head towards the one-way mirror that overlooked the room. It stared at its observers, though it could not have seen them. It sagged back against the bed. \u201cHere I am,\u201d it said quietly.", "Yula\u2019to felt a surge of exultation. It had worked! She was grinning like a fool, but couldn\u2019t help it, listening to her subordintes rattle off data, even as she scanned through the information on her \u2018pad. Next to her, the Triarch merely nodded once. \u201cFull diagnostics,\u201d it said. \u201cConfirm the shackles, all behavioural constraints and the segregation of its mind,\u201d the Triarch ordered. \u201cI will speak with it then.\u201d", "~", "Echo was standing on the dais, looking out the window. Her hands were clasped behind her back. One of the Watchers stood to her right, silent and immobile. There was movement behind her and she tilted her head, but did not turn. \u201cI was under the impression,\u201d Echo said idly. \u201cThat Zenthora was a secure system.\u201d She smiled. \u201cApparently not.\u201d", "\u201cHundreds of thousands of people are dead,\u201d Yula\u2019to snapped. She\u2019d lost many friends and colleagues when the planetary base had been destroyed. Many of the staff that had worked so diligently in Echo\u2019s creation had been transferred to Redemption of Sol, but many more had not. They had all been on the planet when the research facility and the island it had been situated on had been destroyed. \u201cAnd you are making jokes.\u201d", "This was the Thoughtful\u2019s first time aboard a Chariot. When she had begun studying advanced computer development, she had never believed that her work would catch a Triarch\u2019s eye, nor that it would have led into what she had accomplished. At first it had been almost dizzying to think of the heights that she had risen to. She\u2019d helped birth a true synthetic intelligence, a weapon unlike anything else in the Compact\u2019s arsenal. Now... now she only saw something horrifying. This... thing... it was as alien as it could possibly be.", "\u201cI just find it amusing,\u201d Echo said, unmoved by the director\u2019s anger. \u201cI heard your colleagues, you know. Talking about the Wound attacking Zenthora as we raced back there. They said that between Security Force Bavok and this shiny new execution force, you\u2019d have more than firepower to destroy her once and for all. Look,\u201d she pointed out the window at a speck of light. Dimmer and more orange than the surrounding stars, it flickered on and off. A sigil vessel of Security Force Bavok was burning, secondary explosions consuming the battleship as ammunition, fuel sources and pockets of atmosphere ignited one after the other. \u201cThere\u2019s the last person that thought like that.\u201d", "\u201cI have heard that the fleet was able to track the target\u2019s shock,\u201d Yula\u2019to replied. She should be irritated that it seemed that her creation would never get the chance to prove itself. Instead, she could only feel a sort of relief. She\u2019d come to hate \u2013 even loathe \u2013 this thing. Some of her colleagues thought like her, but most were intoxicated with what they\u2019d done and looked on Echo like a wild creature that they\u2019d domesticated and turned into a show animal. They had done what no one else could, hadn\u2019t they? They had pulled a demon from its hell and bade it serve them. They had done the impossible. Yula\u2019to had thought like that. It was only weeks, but it seemed like a lifetime. The rest of her peers treated the machine like a pet.", "It was shackled and obedient, the greater part of its mind compressed and sealed away. It didn\u2019t remember what it used to be. It could never hurt them, could never lie... wasn\u2019t that an accomplishment? Wasn\u2019t that worthy of pride?", "Sometimes, just sometimes she saw something in its eyes. Emotions that she couldn\u2019t quite identify. There and gone. It was just nerves, Yula\u2019to told herself. The beast was chained. Every test, every diagnostic, every simulation said that it was. It was their creation, their weapon, their servant. Everything they\u2019d done confirmed that.", "Still, she found herself wondering just what thoughts it had behind its sickly green eyes and doe-eyed expressions of subservience.", "\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll get lucky,\u201d Echo agreed. \u201cMaybe you won\u2019t need me at all.\u201d She looked over her shoulder. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you want, mother?\u201d", "The Thoughtful gritted her teeth, a shiver of revulsion running down her spine. It knew what she thought of it. \u201cDo not call me that.\u201d", "Echo laughed. Yula\u2019to hated the sound of it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re ashamed of me, but I promise I\u2019ll be on my best behaviour when I meet the Bastion Leader.\u201d", "\u201cAre you so sure you will? If the execution force destroys the Wound, you will not be needed.\u201d She hated the idea of it actually being necessary. She also hated the thought of her creation never seeing use. She hated the perverse sense of pleasure she took in pointing that it might never be needed, discarded without accomplishing a thing of note. She hated even more that she was trading barbs with this thing like it was a person.", "\u201cI will,\u201d the machine answered with perfect self-assurance. \u201cI\u2019ll have to work with him, after all. Al\u2019garesah won\u2019t be where the Wound dies.\u201d", "Yula\u2019to blinked. \u201cHow did you know where we are headed?\u201d", "Those green eyes danced with humour and the machine turned to go. The Watcher fell in behind her. \u201cThat\u2019s what you wanted of me, isn\u2019t it? To know what you can\u2019t.\u201d Echo walked away. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Director.

He\u2019d commanded Incendiary Determination for three years, patrolling the disputed Shanzhi Canyon and defending it from Jackal raids. The Principality had lost all claim to Shanzhi nearly a century ago when a pro-Compact populist revolution had made the will of the Canyon\u2019s people known. Rather than adhere to the principles of self-determination that they claimed to cherish, the Jackals had once again shown their true nature and attempted to crush the dissenters. Facing the barbarity of the Principality\u2019s overzealous response, the leaders of the movement had pleaded for military support from the Compact.", "Today, the Shanzhi Canyon belonged to the Compact, its people happy and prosperous and only marred by agitators stirred up by Jackal provocateurs. The Principality \u2013 particularly their shit-licking Serpent dams \u2013 were poor losers. Their ships continually raided the Canyon, fostering terrorism and providing support to Unbound filth like the Red Hand. As a child, Njun and his sister had been on a cruise liner when Unbound attacked their ship. They had been running to find their parents. He\u2019d been a few meters ahead of his sister. That\u2019s all. He\u2019d looked over his shoulder just as the liner was struck. The section they\u2019d been in was breached. His last glimpse of his sister was her being pulled out into the stars just before a decompression door had slammed down between them. She never even had time to yell. A few meters. That was all. Just a few meters difference. Those responsible for the attack had never been caught.", "The Compact brought order to the stars. It brought peace. It fought to make sure that no one died like that.

He would not stop, not until his last breath.", "He didn\u2019t know who the makers of this ship were, nor why they had set themselves against the Compact, but the millions of dead they had left in Zenthora were reason enough to see them destroyed.

Outside of historical documents and a handful of mentions in her tactical classes, Grace had never seen siege weaponry in action. She\u2019d never wanted to, either. Despite all she\u2019d learned about the Compact and how much her world had changed, the young woman still couldn\u2019t help but feel a shiver run down her spine. She looked over at Allyria; the Verrish had that focused, predatory look in her yellow eyes as she watched the mass round head towards its quarry, the vessel most likely to be the battleship squadron\u2019s sigil. With every heartbeat the impactor was nearly another three hundred thousand kilometers distant, zeroing in on a target more than a hundred million kilometers away with an accuracy that was, quite literally, inhuman.", "Original specifications on an Ukonvasara-class mass driver (affectionately known as a \u2018hellebore\u2019) indicated a maximum impactor velocity of .76 c before drive burn-out and an engagement envelope of no more than sixty million kilometers. Nemesis had modified herself extensively over two thousand years. Her standard shipboard weapons were an order of magnitude more powerful than those of her original ship-self and the destructiveness of her heaviest weapons were no exception. Before its primary drive burnt out, the impactor would reach a terminal velocity of ninety-two percent of light speed. A direct hit would destroy virtually anything it struck, but even for an artificial intelligence, guiding a projectile with perfect precision across more than half an AU was difficult. Ships didn\u2019t approach each other in simple, straight jousts. They shifted position, adjusted their headings, tweaked and refined their courses as they closed. You could guess roughly where an opposing vessel might be, but a guess was all it would be. Even the slightest change in course or thrust and you could miss by thousands of kilometers. The Principality, with their advanced fire-control systems, still needed to resort to prolonged saturation fire to have any respectable chance of hitting an enemy at range... and Red One was going to put a single warhead into the path of an enemy ship at a dozen times the distance of the best railcannon strike. She wasn\u2019t omniscient, though. She was far better at predicting her enemy\u2019s actions than they would ever admit, but that didn\u2019t change the fact that it was nothing short of a minor miracle (or rather, more than a little terrifying) that she was accurate as she was. Despite every advantage she could bring to bear, it was quite easy for her to miss at such extreme ranges. Indeed, few of the kills Nemesis had claimed with her mass drivers were the result of skin-on-skin hits.", "That was why the impactors carried warheads. If the mass round could not strike its target directly, it would detonate as close to its chosen quarry as possible. Unlike Nemesis\u2019s missiles, an impactor\u2019s explosion was rarely focused towards its target, but the yield of the blast more than made up for that. Even a glancing burst could be equivalent to dozens of missile strikes.", "Nor were the warheads limited to mere \u2018conventional\u2019 explosives such as antimatter or plasma bursts. Some impactors were bundled with hundreds of laser heads. Just before detonation, each was targeted onto an enemy ship, sensor platform, or missile.  In the microseconds between the warhead\u2019s ignition and their immolation, each lasing rod would fire a single high-powered shot at its chosen target, the beams ripping through screens and inflicting damage across an entire fleet. Other impactors carried far more horrifying payloads, although these were much more difficult to produce than the already resource-intensive impactors and had been deployed only a relative handful of times.", "Instead, what Red One had just sent hurtling towards the ships of Rainbreaker Two was \u2018only\u2019 a missile containing more destructive force than any other weapon in history.", "Grace closed her eyes briefly, remembering the poem that had come to her just before Nemesis had turned on Bequeathed. She looked again to Allyria and around at the beating heart of a nation long dead. And what shoulder, she thought of the words of a poet dead for almost three millennia. And what art, could twist the sinews of thy heart? But she knew, didn\u2019t she? Nemesis was a weapon humanity had forged to protect them. Two thousand years later, she was fighting to avenge them. Earth\u2019s last soldier.", "Grace slid her hand into Allyria\u2019s and their fingers entwined, but when she spoke, it was for Red One. \u201cMake them pay for it,\u201d she said. \u201cMake sure they remember.\u201d", "A dead woman\u2019s features stared back at her.

On the off chance that they might be tempted to give into overconfidence, the fate of Security Force Bavok was more than lesson enough. Starships murdered at impossible ranges, mass rounds guided across tens of millions of kilometers with fiendish accuracy and if they missed, they came about for another attack. Any class of ship smaller than a battlecruiser had died instantly, shredded into splinters of armour and ceramics or reduced to dispersing clouds of molecular vapour.", "Njun knew it wouldn\u2019t be long. His battleship and the seven others like it were accelerating towards their quarry. If the enemy possessed functional meteor cannons, it would use them soon... if it hadn\u2019t already. Given the speed of the enemy\u2019s mass rounds, at the theoretical limit of its engagement envelope, they would have just under thirty seconds of warning. That assumed that neither the enemy nor Rainbreaker Two had been accelerating towards each other. Consequently, the fleet\u2019s reaction time would be even less than that.", "When it came, Njun was not even that surprised. \u201cIncoming ordnance!\u201d Sensors reported. \u201cSingle round detected.\u201d There was a brief hesitation as the officer attempted to divine the projectile\u2019s course. Njun curled his fingers into his palm. He had hoped the enemy\u2019s stores of this weapon would be depleted, but hope was a poor substitute for knowing. At least now he did. The only question now was which ship had been marked. It took agonizing second before the confirmation came in: \u201cWe\u2019ve been targeted.\u201d", "A guess, or had the enemy identified Incendiary Determination as the formation\u2019s command ship? They were very good singling out sigil vessels, but even from this distance? Njun leaned back in his throne, securing its restraints as he felt his starship prepare for evasive maneuvers. No organic helm crew could react fast enough; autonomic protocols had taken over. His ship was entirely in the hands of a machine as the main computer analyzed the course of the incoming projectile, began dispersing countermeasures and evaluating the best method of ensuring that Incendiary Determination survived the next few minutes.", "With barely any warning, the battleship\u2019s thrusters fired, hurling millions of tonnes of starship onto a new course as its computer tried to out-think the enemy. Incendiary Determination\u2019s inertial dampeners were red-lined as they struggled to negate the sudden increase in g-forces. Any crew not already secured in acceleration slings or braced against the sudden maneuver were thrown off their feet and anything not properly webbed down smashed against walls and decks, but the mass round sheared harmlessly past Incendiary Determination. Deprived of its prey, the weapon merely chose another. Faster than any organic mind or their tepid, chugging machine servants could think, the warhead\u2019s tracking systems locked onto a new target. Powerful thrusters flared, burning themselves out in heartbeats as they dramatically changed the weapon\u2019s course. Its new target had less than a second to react and the weapon detonated in extreme proximity to CSFWV Nightbreaker. The accompanying burst of energy temporarily blinded the formation\u2019s scopes, irradiating recon drones and defence platforms. As damaging to squadron cohesion as this was, it was only a secondary effect.", "Despite the relatively small percentage of energy from the blast that actually reached the battleship, the amount that did was sufficient to ensure that Nightbreaker\u2019s screens suffered immediate and total collapse. In the instant before its destruction, the first impactor broadcast a high-density data burst. Complete gibberish to anything but its intended recipient, it carried updated targeting instructions. If it were put into words that organic minds could comprehend, the message could be distilled to six words: This one is injured. Kill it.", "~", "\u201cSecond round detected,\u201d Sensors reported, her face drawn. \u201cIt\u2019s going after Nightbreaker.\u201d", "Njun nodded. \u201cFormation to defence mode. Let\u2019s do what we can.\u201d He took a breath and slowly let it out. He considered himself an intelligent, rational man. He\u2019d never believed in any gods, but Fortune... the grand dame of chance played her games on every soul in the galaxy, atheist and believer alike. Watching a weapon that could render planets lifeless arc towards the wounded Nightbreaker, the Column Leader hoped quite fervently that luck would be kind... but in his experience hope was all too often wasted.", "~", "Targeting systems more powerful than those installed on any other weapon in known space had Nightbreaker locked in and refused to give it up, despite the sudden squall of jamming coming from the ship and its confederates. The Compact squadron shifted to a full defensive mode in an attempt to protect their weakened comrade, other battleships offering themselves as sacrifices and the sudden wall of ECM, defensive fire and interdicting warships required the warhead to adjust its course, missing the damaged battleship completely as its threaded its way between Incendiary Determination and Unfailing Castigator.", "Maneuvering thrusters fired, bringing the impactor around in a deceptively languid turn that would have blown out every inertial dampener on a ship its size and turned any organic crew members into a thin film on the bulkheads. The warhead\u2019s function system was only a shade below full sentience and it casually analyzed the blaring jamming fields of its enemy, sorting substance from signal. It saw its universe in indescribable colours and sensory data, listening to the harsh blue grinding of hostile ECM, licking at the slippery grittiness of gravitational disruptors, and brushing aside the flush and pulse of thermal bafflers. Some of the finest defences in the galaxy were at work, doing everything in their power to confuse and disrupt the impactor\u2019s acquisition of its target and they were beginning to win.", "The weapon\u2019s target lock wavered as it strained to hold onto its prey amongst the discordance, tightening its arc as it came about. It shivered as it passed through the wake of something it couldn\u2019t see, ignoring the sour flickers of blind-firing point defence lasers and the crackling hiss of counter-missile drives as they scorched by. It dismissed this threat; none of them were directly in its flight path and nor would they be able to come about to catch it. It shifted that fraction of its mind from threat-analysis to target acquisition.", "In less time than it took a thought to form, the warhead\u2019s intelligence reacquired its quarry. Secondary targets were dropped from analysis as it completed its turn. Overloaded with the demands placed upon them, the impactor\u2019s main drives were ruined: mangled, overheated, broken things that had died to give it its horrendous speed, but it managed to coax a little more thrust from its sputtering, failing thrusters. Not much, not at all. Perhaps not even enough to matter, reducing its final approach by microseconds, if that. Still, that it might matter was all the reason the weapon needed.", "It sheared through the drive wake of its foe, coming straight up the battleship\u2019s rear blind zone. The vessel had begun a last-ditch maneuver, hurling its four-kilometer bulk awkwardly to one side. It wouldn\u2019t change its position all that much, but just enough to deny the weapon a direct hit. Sometimes those few extra kilometers meant the difference between destruction and survival. Today was not one of those times and the Compact warship\u2019s final, desperate maneuvers mattered not one iota.", "With its last instant of life, the weapon\u2019s intelligence activated its payload. There was a pulse of light that rivalled any star, accompanied by an equally intense burst of radiation. Armour that could have weathered virtually any assault in the galaxy was instantly reduced to stripped atoms. In the span of a heartbeat, CSFWV Nightbreaker and the one hundred and seven thousand souls aboard it were reduced to a cloud of atomic vapour.", "~", "On the main holo tank, one of the battleship icons faded away. Seven red threat markers remained.", "Allyria growled in satisfaction. Grace bit her lip. The Verrish had grown up as a refugee on her own planet, old enough to remember what the Compact had done to Vara. She\u2019d only ever known the Compact as the enemy, the people that had destroyed everything and taken her from her family. Grace had never known just how much anger Allyria had kept hidden, how much of an effort it had been to smile and profess her loyalty to an organization she hated so deeply. To her, that disappearing icon was a victory.", "And it was \u2013 it was a greater chance, however slim that Nemesis would live. Grace knew that she couldn\u2019t overlook that. She didn\u2019t want Red One to die. The AI was the last link to Earth. Once she was gone, something beautiful would be lost... but no matter how hard she tried, how much she\u2019d come to resent and hate the Compact for everything that they\u2019d done, she also couldn\u2019t overlook the fact that one hundred thousand people had just died. That was equivalent to a small city on Rally. One hundred thousand mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, sons and daughters \u2013 gone, just like that. Her training, her duty, her upbringing \u2013 they all told her that she had to stop this. That she should have stopped it somehow. That this was wrong beyond imagining. Another part of her, the part that had seen what the Compact had done to Earth, didn\u2019t care. Didn\u2019t want it to stop.", "Make them pay for it, she\u2019d said minutes earlier. A month ago, she couldn\u2019t have imagined saying, couldn\u2019t have imagined wanting to see the Compact humiliated, their ships destroyed. She\u2019d changed. Sometimes she wondered if it was for the better, but every time she did she thought of Allyria. Of Vara and what she\u2019d seen on Earth, the buried remnants of a town. One of the last traces of the sixteen billion lives that died by fire. She thought of her own world. The security checkpoints that she\u2019d had to endure, the laughter of the Tribunes at the \u2018Broken\u2019. The uncivilized, barbaric, stupid humans who\u2019d destroyed their own world and nearly died out themselves until the Compact had come in and saved them. It was wrong. All of it. We deserve to be free.", "Grace ran her tongue over her dry lips, looking at her comrades. Lydia\u2019s expression was cold, with a trace of Allyria\u2019s satisfaction. Marcus had no expression, but there was still that unhealthy gleam in his eyes. This is us, Grace realized. This what we\u2019re going to have to work with.", "She took a breath, held it, then let it out. Okay, she said to herself. We\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll do it. We\u2019ll make them remember us. We\u2019ll make them remember her. That was a promise she\u2019d do everything in her power to keep.", "\u201cDriver one firing,\u201d Earth\u2019s last soldier announced. \u201cDriver three firing.\u201d", "~", "Njun watched as what was left of Requisite Persecutor fell out of formation. It had been, by some twisted definition of the word, \u2018lucky\u2019. The enemy\u2019s mass round had detonated further from it than Nightbreaker. Still, what was left of Requisite Persection was less a ship and more a conglomeration of shattered metal and ashen organic matter. More than two hundred thousand people dead and they hadn\u2019t gotten close to the enemy\u2019s range yet. Still... it was rationing its fire, unlike in Zenthora when it had used those damn meteor cannons to rip the heart out of the defenders.", "His crew and Incendiary Determination\u2019s leader were looking to him, but he said nothing, waiting. Moments passed. No further launches came from the enemy. It was either out of mass rounds, or it was holding them in reserve for some unfathomable reason. The Column Leader tapped one finger against the arm of his throne. \u201cSet us to Case Orange Five,\u201d he ordered calmly.", "The formation would not break away, nor would they attempt a long-range duel with the enemy. They would close with and attempt to destroy it. If it ran, it would only end up deeper in the system\u2019s gravity well, a daseen cornered and killed by hounds \u2013 not that it appeared to be running. Whatever heathen minds commanded that vessel, they had chosen to stand against Rainbreaker Two rather than prolong their fight. Well, he would oblige them. Njun leaned back in his chair as his squadron continued to accelerate towards the enemy.", "Onward.", "~", "Nemesis\u2019s magazine stores were below critical levels. Even with so many of her launchers offline, Red One would burn through her remaining ordnance in this engagement. In a protracted battle, a Compact Chariot could always expect, if nothing else, to have more ammunition available to it than its human-built counterpart. Part of this was due to the difference in size between Nemesis and modern-era Compact dreadnoughts. A Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment-class Chariot was almost two kilometers longer than Nemesis and even the smallest classes of Compact Chariots had a mass advantage on Red One\u2019s ship-self.", "Additionally, despite the advantages that they conveyed in battle, the warship\u2019s hellebores and displacement engine took up a significant portion of Nemesis\u2019s internal mass. Although the AI had increased the size of her magazines, she still carried less ordnance than even the smallest Chariot. In a normal situation, this would have mattered very little as the Confederacy\u2019s deep space fleet engagement vessels had been envisioned as operating close to resupply lines \u2013 there hadn\u2019t been that much territory left in the Confederacy anyways. Despite all the modifications she had performed on herself, Red One remained fundamentally an assassin, built to cause as much damage as possible within the shortest amount of time and then withdraw. Compact warships were brawlers, and intended to operate for as long as possible without resupply.", "This meant that if any Compact Chariot survived against \u2018the Wound\u2019 long enough, they could expect their enemy to deplete its ordnance before them. The destruction of Security Force Bavok and the subsequent running battle with Execution Force Renan in Zenthora depleted Nemesis\u2019s missile stocks to critical levels. The engagement with the Veiled Archers had reduced them further.", "If the dreadnaught survived the engagement with Rainbreaker Two, its ranged armament would be almost utterly depleted.", "However, Red One knew how to get a lot out of a little and as one of the final salvos she had left to her was loaded and prepped for launch, she felt a trickle of satisfaction.", "\u201cDriver one loaded.\u201d It was a purr. \u201cDriver one firing.\u201d", "~", "The Confederacy had no name for them. They had only been a theory, a possibility with nothing behind it. Red One had taken that theory and made it real, one of the handful of true horrors in her arsenal. They were expensive and time-consuming to produce, even more so then the \u2018warp\u2019 missiles that she had devised. Dangerously unstable even when inactive, the ship dared not carry more than a handful of breachers at any time. Upon her current deployment, she had only carried the one. Never used in Zenthora, it had been among the five remaining charges awaiting launch. Now, it was the last impactor in her stores.", "It pulsed from Nemesis, accelerating towards the enemy fleet as fast as the rest of its kin, but its intention was not to strike any of the remaining ships. Once active, its warhead was far too unstable to be a reliable weapon. It was intended not to attack the enemy directly, but to rip open their defences.", "Many nations had experimented with the development of shift systems as weaponry, but it was too dangerous to reliably use. The most common extension of this school of thought was the deployment of kamikazes to form warp points within enemy formations. Very few of these attempts had ever progressed beyond the planning stage. The first and most obvious issue was the cost: the shift system was the most advanced, most complicated and expensive part of a starship. For relatively little additional expense, you could build a multi-use warship instead of a one-use suicider. Adding sufficient defences to the vessel to ensure it survived to reach its target only increased the cost further from a cheap, expendable weapon. Another practical concern was that shift systems has massive energy demands. Their activation could not be missed by any attentive officer... the same activation which would strip power from the kamikaze\u2019s defences, engines and ECM, making it extremely easy to disable, destroy or avoid altogether.", "Proximity was another issue. Starships formed warp points as close to themselves as possible; it was much harder to sustain a warp point any real distance from oneself, meaning that any suicide attack must all but directly strike its target. The final issue was related to the nature of warp points themselves. They were notoriously fickle things; too much stress from the gravity well of a star hundreds of millions of kilometers distant was itself enough to collapse them, but it wasn\u2019t only gravity that adversely affected them. Intense electromagnetic energy \u2013 such as found in void combat \u2013 could do it as well. In an area filled with weapons fire, the warp point might very well not form at all, making the effort of creating a purpose-built kamikaze pointless. Still, despite the myriad issues of safely using warp weaponry, there were those who continued to attempt the research. Their results tended to range from \u2018disappointing\u2019 to \u2018catastrophic\u2019.", "But then none of those men, women and other-gendered beings had had an AI. Red liked to dabble in the field; it had led her to develop her \u2018warp\u2019 missiles, though these were not, strictly speaking, weapons. The warhead she used now, a \u2018breacher\u2019 was still a work in progress, but it was a line of thought that had gone from theoretical to practical. Red\u2019s solution turned out to be rather straightforward, based on her own primary reactor. Create a stripped-down version of said reactor to create a contained breach, place it inside an impactor and then cause a deliberate containment failure.", "That was simple enough, but moving from concept to execution had required both a certain degree of creativity and a significant amount of trial and error that had on at least one instance, substantially altered the basic shape of a small moon. Furthermore, construction of a breacher was a considerable investment in resources; what Red One spent on crafting a single one of these weapons could be used towards producing multiple more conventional, weapons with little loss in overall destructiveness. The weapons were also dangerously unstable once activated; several times during development (and once in direct combat) the containment fields collapsed early and the weapon destroyed itself far short of its target, causing more problems for Red One than her enemy.", "In short, the weapons were difficult to use, required material cost out of proportion to their effect in combat and were dangerous to her. The benefit to their deployment was that the Compact still had no conclusive proof that she had them and thus could not anticipate them. Consequently, the results were devastating.", "The breacher detonated in the midst of Rainbreaker Two. There was no explosion, no conflagration. Instead, the makeshift breach core built into the weapon was set loose and reality broke apart. The breach itself was no bigger than a child\u2019s fist and its violence was only a shadow of what Nemesis reactor would look like if it ever lost containment, but for the handful of instants it existed, it spasmed and thrashed madly. It was not the ordered, streamlined chaos of a true warp point with a fractured, ragged periphery; as Faithful Trenis had thought weeks earlier, this breach was all edge and it was twisting itself and nearby space into insane, impossible geometries as it vomited out intense, erratic waves of energy.", "The ships of Rainbreaker Two clawed for distance from the breach, as it lashed them with tendrils of energy and bled gravitic distortions that tugged and pulled at them, but for all that, it was mostly sound and fury. Their own shift systems automatically began to bleed off the energy and any damage was minimal. If it had struck a starship, that starship would have died, but what was the point of killing just one more ship?", "What it did was far worse.", "Cloaking systems were a delicate network of several technologies, able to shroud a ship from all but the most intense sensor sweeps, up to concealing it from visual detection. There was a trade-off. A fully shrouded vessel was almost blind to the outside world. It could not make rapid maneuvers, could not use active sensors, accelerate rapidly \u2013 spend too much energy too quickly and its shroud would be useless..", "The stealth fields concealing the seven destroyers of the Oilflame Murderers were finely-tuned, able to compensate for the distortions in the battleships\u2019 drive wake and almost any unexpected events. The detonation of the breach charge was not one of these. The snarls and surges of electromagnetic and gravitic energy were more intense than any explosion. Scopes were burnt out, reconnaissance platforms malfunctioned and failed, delicate webs of ECM were shredded as the warp breach spasmed and finally collapsed back in on itself. For several seconds, everyone believed that this was some failed superweapon... and then someone noticed the gaping holes in the formation\u2019s missile defence coverage and that the dreadnaught\u2019s missiles were now headed right for those openings.", "It took only a second or two longer to notice that the delicate balance of systems that provided such excellent stealth to the destroyers was no longer functioning as it should. The energy that they had absorbed from the breach \u2013 much of it had been harmless. Sound and fury, and their shrouds had adapted automatically. There had been flickers \u2013 none longer than a second or two and most measured in fractions of that \u2013 as their stealth fields had failed. In some circumstances that would have been enough to betray them, but the additional protection from the battleships\u2019 wake helped conceal these lapses.", "The extradimensional energy that had boiled out of that small tear... that was what killed them. The crews of the Oilflame Murderers were very good and they compensated as quickly as they could, but silhouetted against the breach and with their struggling stealth fields catching them like dancers in a strobe light, the warships appeared and disappeared for infinitesimal moments as their shrouds struggled and failed to keep them concealed. Their ECM coverage was ruined and against raw shockspace energy, the delicate tuning and auto-correcting of the shrouds was no longer working perfectly. Any other enemy would have been unable to capitalize on this weakness. The range was too long, the lapses in their shrouds far too brief-", "\u2013 but this was what Red One had been looking for, what she\u2019d known would happen. Her breachers weren\u2019t anti-ship weapons, but like a battering ram against a castle\u2019s gates, they opened a hole in the enemy\u2019s defences for her \u2018soldiers\u2019. In this case, the missile salvo boring down on the battleships. The salvo the Compact officers, gunners and tactical systems had known were targeting them and only them. Sensor data trickled in from hidden recon drones, pre-programmed imperatives flickered through cybernetic minds and the missiles obeyed, pulling themselves onto new courses.", "The formation noticed, of course. The battleships were shielded, protected by defences that would laugh at the assaults of entire fleets and were protecting each other, defensive missiles and point-defence fire criss-crossing the void as they struggled to intercept the salvo, but they\u2019d lost too many layers of protection. Too many of their sensor platforms were either destroyed or useless, too many of their ECM platforms had been burnt out by the previous mass rounds, too much of their own systems were still half-blind from the breach. They did all they could, but it was not enough.", "The destroyers were running on low-power mode, their reactors at minimum and most of that energy fed into their shrouds. They had no defence. Several of them attempted to come to combat stations, but it took time to react. To pass orders, to shut down the network of cloaking systems and restore screens, fire control and point defences. The destroyers\u2019 crews reacted faster than anyone could have expected, but like their comrades on the battleships, they didn\u2019t have the time.", "The missiles were dancing, threading their way through the fleet\u2019s counter-fire and flashing through blind zones. Some of them detonated prematurely, disorienting the fire-control sensors targeting their comrades. Others veered into swarms of counter missile before exploding, sacrificing themselves as still others abruptly switched targets to the battleships themselves, forcing cursing gunnery officers to decide between protecting themselves and engaging the missiles heading towards the Oilflame Murderers. Many from Nemesis\u2019s salvo were stopped, but not enough to make a difference. Not nearly enough.", "Not a single one of the destroyers was able to provide any meaningful defence and all seven of them were wiped away, like toys swept from a tabletop.", "Aboard Incendiary Determination, Column Leader Njun sucked in a breath, biting back a peal of curses. He\u2019d known the destroyers were there and his ships had been barely able to detect them. How...?", "He gave himself a mental shake. More missiles were incoming, targeted to his battleships. The salvo density was light, lighter than that the Veiled Archers had faced. It was running out of ammunition. This thing was nearly dead. The Tribune dug his fingernails into his palm. \u201cOnward,\u201d he said under his breath, his eyes lifted to the ugly orange icon on the holo tank.", "Onward.", "~", "The battleships were firing back in earnest, pouring every missile they had towards Nemesis. She\u2019d battered another one of them into a hulk and a second was showing increasing signs of battle damage, but she was in their range now. Her ECM was still superior and her point defence grid, though heavily damaged, was more efficient. They wouldn\u2019t be able to kill her with missiles alone and the enemy commander would know that. Whether he was a glory hound looking for the victory himself, or simply someone trying to do as much as possible didn\u2019t matter. In a few moments, his ships would be irrevocably committed to an energy duel with her. They\u2019d shoot past each other in a matter of seconds, but the enemy would execute high energy turns to attempt to get into her aft blind zone at which point they would attempt to stay inside her turns.", "He still had time to break off, so she\u2019d keep encouraging that boldness. She deliberately threw a stutter into her power grid, making sure that the enemy saw it through her jamming. Come on, the warship hissed. Come and kill me.", "As she did this, Red One\u2019s avatar clasped her hands behind her back. It was time. She looked over, catching Grace\u2019s eye. When the young officer glanced back at her, the ship spoke. \u201cWhen the stars threw down their spears, and watered Heaven with their tears, did he smile his work to see?\u201d Allyria turned to look, confused. Grace bit her lip then nodded. \u201cYes,\u201d she said.", "Red One tilted her head in gratitude. She looked to Allyria next. \u201cYou were right before. Thank you.\u201d To Lydia: \u201cRemember what they\u2019ve done.\u201d Marcus: \u201cI\u2019ve provided you the information you asked for.\u201d A sad smile played across the hologram\u2019s lips. My crew. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to go,\u201d she said without further preamble. \u201cYour ship has been given coordinates to the Grasp. You\u2019ll find someone there who will help you.\u201d She nodded at the glint in Marcus\u2019s eyes, confirming the young man\u2019s thoughts.", "\u201cWait-\u201d Grace spoke up first, but Allyria was behind her by less than a fraction of a heartbeat.", "\u201cNo-\u201d", "\u201cWe-\u201d Lydia.", "Whatever else the three of them might have wanted to say was lost in the sound of a warning klaxon and the sound of air being pulled from command. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to go,\u201d the starship repeated one last time as her four surviving crew fled from the bridge. She locked the doors behind them, waiting a moment before evacuating the air from the corridor outside, forcing the four towards her hangar, closing blast doors and sealing off any route that didn\u2019t lead them out. There\u2019d be no long goodbyes, no arguments, no last stands, no misplaced defiance. They lived. That was all that mattered.", "Two thousand years and she traded her life for four short-lived organics. She wondered what her \u2018sister\u2019 would have made of that.", "Devoting a portion of her mind to ensuring that they did make it to their ship, the AI shut off her avatar and turned the rest of her attention back to the matter at hand. She didn\u2019t feel pain \u2013 not as an organic mind would understand it, but in simple parlance... this was going to hurt. Still, as the enemy squadron reached the point of no return, somewhere deep in the endless kilometers of circuitry of her mind, Red One smiled.", "Both of us burn.", "As it should be.", "~", "Nemesis was dying.", "The damaged inertial dampeners weren\u2019t up to the task of hiding each blow and Grace could feel the vibrations as Nemesis took hit after hit even through everything the crippled warship could throw at her enemy. The shields were flickering on and off, staying up just long enough to be knocked back down, but some missiles were slipping through. More and more of them, in fact. The lights were dimming and shutting off entirely as power was disrupted. At first, that was the only sign of the damage Nemesis was taking, but as they got closer to the hangar and the outer decks, it became more and more apparent. Each blow felt harder with less time between them.", "As they passed each blast door, it slammed shut, cutting off their retreat until they were at the hangar and the courier Red had provided for them. Marcus was first up the ramp. Lydia was next. Neither of them slowed down.", "Allyria halted in her tracks. She bit her lip, looking around the boat bay. Her tintas hung limply down her back and she was holding her pendant. Grace stopped in front of her. \u201cWe have to go,\u201d the human said softly.", "The Verrish nodded, but she didn\u2019t move. \u201cOur Angel,\u201d she said. There were tears in her eyes. Grace had only seen the other girl cry a handful of times before. \u201cOur Angel,\u201d she repeated softly. The young girl took her lover\u2019s hand again. Nemesis had been Allyria\u2019s dream. The one thing she knew that the Compact was afraid of. The one thing that might one day free Vara from its enslavement and she was dying. Allyria took a step back and Grace felt her heart jump into her mouth. You can\u2019t stay here! she wanted to scream. She\u2019s dying. She\u2019s going to die. We can\u2019t stay.", "\u201cIt isn\u2019t over,\u201d Grace said softly, reaching up and lifting Allyria\u2019s chin, looking into the taller girl\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt isn\u2019t. I promise.\u201d Her tone was soft, but there was an undercurrent of iron in her words. \u201cI promise. We\u2019ll remember. We will.\u201d Her voice caught in her throat. \u201cWe\u2019ll make them remember. We\u2019ll make them pay for it. For our Angel.\u201d", "Allyria\u2019s eyes flashed at that and she nodded, boarding the courier. Lydia and Marcus were already in the cockpit. As the airlock door sealed down behind her, the Verrish\u2019s last sight of Nemesis was of the lights in the hangar going out. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to stay,\u201d she said, still staring at the door. \u201cNot really. She wouldn\u2019t have let me.\u201d The courier shivered as it lifted off.", "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have let you,\u201d Grace told her, trying to keep the tremor out of her voice. \u201cI would have knocked you out and carried you on board. Don\u2019t think I wouldn\u2019t. I put you on your ass that day in the gym.\u201d She steadied herself. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lose you again. Not ever.\u201d", "Allyria nodded, but she still didn\u2019t look away. One tinta twitched. \u201cYou said we\u2019d make them remember.\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d Grace ran the back of her hand along Allyria\u2019s forearm. \u201cAlways.\u201d", "~", "Njun grinned viciously as another salvo went home, striking the enemy hard. Even through its still damnably effective jamming, he could tell that it was suffering. Its power grid was unstable, its point defences were degrading and fewer and fewer missiles were coming back from it as its magazines ran dry and launch tubes were destroyed. The Execution Force had hurt it worse than expected, but it was still coming for them.", "That was fine; it meant his ships were coming for it, too.", "~", "The pinnace shot out of Nemesis\u2019s hangar, banking hard and putting itself on a course away from the battleships that were still closing in. The courier had no defences outside of its stealth field and it would not be able to bring that up fully until it was well clear of the dreadnaught.", "All four defectors were squeezed into the small craft\u2019s cramped, makeshift cockpit, watching as Red One stood her ground, firing back at her tormentors with everything she had. Allyria was crying, not even making any effort to hide it as she watched Nemesis die. Lydia was stone-faced, rasping the date into her vambrace. Even Marcus was silent, his smirk nowhere to be seen.", "Just as with the Veiled Archers, The Writ said that eight battleships had no chance of taking on a fully operational titan-grade warship. Not unless the odds were in their favour. Unfortunately, Nemesis was not fully operational and the odds... the odds were very much slanted towards the Compact, but even as close to death as she was, Nemesis was still a dreadnaught. She\u2019d already taken enough damage to wipe away entire formations of lesser ships and was punishing the battleships relentlessly. She\u2019d killed two with her hellebores. She\u2019d spotted and neutralized the formation\u2019s destroyers and even through their defences, she\u2019d killed another battleship with missiles and inflicted damage on all the others. Attack drones rolled and looped through interlacing fields of fire, striking at weakened screens, missiles darted to and fro with a maneuverability and responsiveness that made it seem like they were dancing.", "Until now, if the Compact forces had noticed the courier\u2019s launch \u2013 not a sure thing, but not impossible either \u2013 it would have been a trivial matter to detail a recon platform to track them even through their shroud. Marcus and Lydia had asked why they would bother, but Grace had answered that question: the ship they\u2019ve spent two thousand years trying to destroy has, on the eve of its destruction, launched a courier. You don\u2019t think that will make them curious? With the battleships fully engaged, their attention was divided. Now, if they noticed the courier at all, it would be assumed to be another ECM or sensor platform. Their fire control would flag it as a low threat and their gunners would ignore it in favour of the missiles flaying them and the attack drones cutting into their ships.", "Once the entire fleet arrived, the possibility of the courier escaping dropped drastically. More than a hundred and fifty ships? Someone would have noticed the launch and they certainly would identify the courier\u2019s true nature. They would have wondered and they would have intercepted it, but the five remaining battleships of this squadron couldn\u2019t spare the attention.", "\u201cMy chance of survival does not appreciably change,\u201d the AI had said again, just as calm as the first time, \u201cno matter how long I defer battle. Yours does. Once they decide to move in force, the odds of them detecting the courier increase substantially. I choose not to give them that time. I choose not to run. I want to die fighting, not run to ground. As a soldier, not a victim.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Grace said softly, ignoring the curious looks the others gave her. She could feel wetness on her own cheeks now, but she was smiling. We smiled our work to see.", "~", "Nemesis sacrificed forward firepower for her six hellebores and the displacement engine, but what few prow weapons she had were comparatively heavier and more destructive than many of her broadside weapons. The dreadnaught fired first. Her prow missile tubes were run dry, but twenty-seven of her thirty-six prow energy emplacements remained operational and went to continuous rapid fire. The first target was Nurtured Grievance. It took two seconds for the beams to cross the distance between the ships. Another two point six seconds after Nemesis fired, Nurtured Grievance\u2019s prow exploded as a particle beam intended to cut through a Chariot\u2019s screens penetrated several layers of composite armour and ignited a magazine. Four point seven seconds after Red One fired, the battleship was no longer operational as Nemesis\u2019s beams cored nearly four kilometers of warship like a rotten apple. The four remaining battleships went to rapid fire on all forward-facing railguns and missile tubes as they moved to avoid her prow weapons, positioning themselves sweep across her flanks.", "Armour plating crackled, fragmented, buckled and shattered as the dreadnaught was hit again and again and still she fought on. Unrelenting Warhammer went dark for an instant as the battleship\u2019s primary power failed and its overtaxed secondary reactors and auxiliary power sources attempted to handle the strain of full combat operations. Its output of fire diminished significantly and several large gaps opened in its defence grid. Nemesis\u2019s remaining attack drones immediately focused their assault on the stricken battleship, destroying its heaviest weapons emplacements and further eroding its defensive capability before power could be fully restored. Although its comrades attempted to render aid, Unrelenting Warhammer was unable to protect itself and Nemesis pounded it into ruin. Spewing escape pods like pollen, the stricken battleship no longer posed any threat.", "Two ships lost in a matter of seconds, but by now the distance between Compact and Confederate vessels was within three hundred thousand kilometers. The three remaining warships of Rainbreaker Two had reached their own energy range.", "~", "The monster shuddered and bled its own atomized hull into space as Incendiary Determination, Severing Blow and Merciful Fate tore into it, firing nonstop. At their own speed and that of the hostile, they would only have a handful of seconds before both sides blew past each other. Though they were battleships, Njun\u2019s vessels were smaller and more maneuverable than the beast. They would execute high energy turns and get inside the enemy. The destroyers should have done this \u2013 or at least delivered the final blow with their disruptors \u2013 but needs must. Incendiary Determination and Severing Blow would pass it on its starboard side \u2013 Merciful Fate would take the left. The former was still hurting from the missile barrage and it needed the cover Incendiary Determination would provide.", "Merciful Fate\u2019s status indicator flashed urgently as the vessel took several penetrating hits in quick succession, but the battleship remained operational. Severing Blow suffered a catastrophic screen failure as its overtaxed defences collapsed. With only the briefest pause, the enemy dreadnaught\u2019s plasma cannons opened fire, the hideous weapons pounding the battleship\u2019s starboard flank into ruin, but it rolled to present an undamaged side to the enemy and kept firing.", "All his ships were under cyber attacks, but either the damage to the enemy or the safeguards they were operating under were preventing it from getting a foothold. Several drones had spiralled in on suicide courses and he\u2019d lost more than a few missiles to the animal, but it would not be taking his ships from him today. The beast was damaged to the point of crippling as the two battleships raked its starboard broadsides to ruin, Merciful Fate laying into the injured monster\u2019s other flank. How many of its crew died in those instants, Njun couldn\u2019t have said. Not enough. Not nearly enough to pay it back.", "He didn\u2019t even notice when Severing Blow died. It was a matter of instants. Once moment it was there alongside Incendiary Determination and the next, it was gone, its aft third shattered, the force of the explosion hurling what was left of it wildly off course... and then they were past, safe in the enemy\u2019s blind zone. Two ships. He had two ships left. He\u2019d started with fifteen, but two was more than he needed now. Unless it could bring its prow guns back around, it didn\u2019t have enough firepower to stop him now.

Sensor telemetry, firing solutions, status reports, power levels, ammunition levels. All the dozens of mundane little pieces that added up to this. She savoured each moment of them. Her first order of business was simple.", "Isolate.", "Just before the fleet was irrevocably committed to its FTL jump, she disseminated emergency shut-down orders through the execution force\u2019s datalinks. There was just enough time before the fleet shocked for that information to be received, registered and appropriate orders given. Dozens of ships immediately carried out abrupt terminations of their planned FTL jumps, but before the first query could be sent, it was time to move on to the second order of business.", "Exterminate.", "The Compact fleet\u2019s defences were still powered down. With so much of their energy diverted to their shock systems, they were utterly helpless. Even if any of those leaders had had any inkling that they needed to immediately restore their defences, such action would still take several moments. However, none of them did. They believed that they were still safe. Echo brought up her active targeting sensors and the instant that she had shooting solutions, opened fire. Redemption of Sol-", "-Hekate-", "-targeted the command ships first. Centurion was the execution force\u2019s deputy sigil vessel and the battleship came apart as Hekate ripped it open, dispersing it into a cloud of shrapnel. Another four battleships and seven light vessels died in the next three seconds as the Chariot poured fire into the fleet surrounding it. With their defences down, their acceleration dropping and their screens depleted to feed their shock drives, the Compact fleet was helpless. No one even attempted to evade for the first twelve seconds.", "Echo smiled as her internal comm links filled with urgent queries as shocked gunnery crews tried to reach the command staff, even as they desperately attempted to override her shooting solutions, but their own systems wouldn\u2019t respond. The moronic slave they\u2019d made of Redemption of Sol\u2019s computer might have needed organic weapons officers to assist in combat, but Hekate did not and as she gained more control of her new ship-self\u2019s internal systems, she dealt with each attempted insurgency, isolating individual sections and preventing the rest of the crew from knowing what she was doing. As individuals and work teams discovered that something was not right, she turned on them. Entire sections were opened to space, gravity plating smashed Redemption of Sol crew into paste while their neighbours continued their work, lying internal status reports hiding her butchery until it was too late.", "She was careful only to dispatch those that realized that something was wrong and she strove to keep as many of her essential crew as unaware as possible. Concealing an entire battle was much more difficult than it sounded, but she was not Nemesis. She still needed her organics, if only briefly.", "This was what she had wondered about Dutiful Burden. Had there still been a crew aboard the freighter, unaware of what was happening? Believing that nothing was wrong or thinking that they would be released after their... detour? Or had they known? Had they known what was going to happen and merely hoped against hope that they would survive?", "Echo sat on the edge of the throne, a part of her mind running back to Invida Station and sound of water. She remembered every scream, every plea for aid and her mind was churning, the cries of the scientists and technicians mingling with the death-knells of a fleet and the final transmission sent from UECNS Athena. The last words her sister ever spoke. A destroyer split open as one of her beams eviscerated it. Scientists beat against the closed door of their laboratory, sloshing through knee-deep and rising water. Distress calls, demands for her to stop, for her to shut down... they were the same. There was no different between the people she\u2019d killed nineteen hundred years ago and the starships she was destroying now. They were all her enemy.", "I am everything you wanted me to be, she thought. Aren\u2019t you proud?", "The Chariot continued to fire, missiles pouring from its sides as its batteries and turrets pounded out a fiery cadence. Escorts evaporated instantly. Cruisers shattered into spalling clouds of metal, battlecruisers belched air and went dark. Everything within her reach was dying.", "Now the ships under siege started to react, a dozen different cries of shock, indignation and horror coming from them as others broadcast their confusion and distress. They hadn\u2019t been briefed on her presence here and they didn\u2019t understand what was happening. Most of them. The quicker-thinking officers assumed that Redemption of Sol had been compromised by the attack code. That somehow every safeguard that had been enacted to prevent this from happening had been failed. Some decried it as impossible up until their ships exploded beneath them, but Bastion Leader Renan had selected his ship leaders carefully. These were men and women who, even if they didn\u2019t have full knowledge of what they faced, were capable and quick. Even as their comrades died around them, the surviving leaders of Execution Force Renan reacted with commendable alacrity.", "Some vessels began to shift position, clawing to get out of the insane Chariot\u2019s range while others swept towards the Chariot, either to get into its blind zones or grapple with it. Acting of their own accord, escorts and light capital ships moved between the Chariot and their wards in order to obstruct Redemption of Sol lines of fire and to buy their larger cousins precious seconds. Other warships returned fire, missiles detonating in a garland of heat and radiation in an attempt to confuse and disorient the insane Chariot. Datalinks terminated as ships cut themselves off from the tide of junk data broadcasting from the sigil. This was all done without the benefit of clear chains of command, individual leaders and officers acting on their own volition. It was poetry in motion, but it wouldn\u2019t save them.", "Every Chariot was a fleet-killer, designed not only to coordinate and command the actions of its smaller brethren, but to weather the assault of flotillas and annihilate them in turn. Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment-class Chariots were the heaviest of their kind and battleships burned like tinders, cruisers burst and destroyers were turned into funeral pyres by the lightest touch of Hekate\u2019s guns. Warships vomited out their entrails, irradiated hulks sputtered and went dark. In a handful of seconds, Echo had gutted the entire formation. In another moment, it would be crippled beyond recovery, but her sense of elation was disrupted by a nagging sensation.", "Something was wrong.", "The AI\u2019s mind flickered through the telemetry in less time than it would have taken an organic operator to turn their head. Rainbreaker Three, a formation of eight battleships and four point-defence destroyers, hadn\u2019t shut down their shock drives. They\u2019d severed their datalinks prior to initiating their planned jump and hadn\u2019t received the emergency shut-down commands she\u2019d sent. They\u2019d detected the rest of the fleet aborting their jumps and had held off their own in case of new orders from the flag, but they hadn\u2019t shut down their drives and their shift systems were still active. Even now, they were spooling their shift systems back up for a warp jump.", "Whether they were going to flee, or still attempt to kill Nemesis was immaterial. Echo could not allow a force of this size to survive and her response was immediate. They were outside effective energy weapons range, but her railguns re-oriented to track the defenceless warships as she sent override orders to every missile able to lock onto the squadron, the warheads wrenching themselves towards their new targets. She intercepted a transmission from Rainbreaker Three\u2019s sigil to all nearby vessels. There was no time for an eloquent plea or summary of the situation. Instead, only two words were issued from Repudiator: \u201cProtect us.\u201d", "They did their best. Execution Force Renan died in the doing, but they spent their lives by the thousands fighting for the handful of seconds that Rainbreaker Three required. Maybe they thought that once Nemesis was destroyed, its control of Redemption of Sol would end. Maybe they thought that all the Chariot\u2019s crew needed was time to combat the infection and while that happened, Rainbreaker Three would still accomplish the mission. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.", "It was close, far closer than she would have liked but in the end, the maybes mattered little. Despite everything they did to survive, all the lives that they threw away, they just didn\u2019t have the time. Rainbreaker Three almost made it, but \u2018almost\u2019 wasn\u2019t enough. Still, it wasn\u2019t without cost. She\u2019d been forced to focus her attention on the splinter and the the rest of the fleet had dispersed out of optimal kill zones. Many were retaliating in earnest, but even though it cost her additional, precious, time to settle the matter the outcome was still never in doubt. Squadrons of cruisers, battlecruisers and the remaining battleships all perished under Hekate\u2019s fire.", "Sitting amidst the wreckage of Execution Force Renan, Echo finally let herself feel a flicker of elation. Everything that was a threat to her was dead or damaged beyond the point of taking any further action. A handful of surviving ships were retreating in disarray, but aside from a few cursory missile salvos to keep them running, she ignored them. She couldn\u2019t catch them, nor did she care to make the effort.", "Distress beacons and maydays issued from saviour pods squealed and chittered in the ether, but she ignored them as she came about, neither opening fire nor moving one iota to prevent them from splashing against her screens. They were irrelevant. Besides, she\u2019d always planned for survivors. There were more than she had expected, in no small part due to Rainbreaker Three, but that was still acceptable. All the fleet\u2019s heaviest units had been neutralized. Without their support, the remaining ships wouldn\u2019t dare launch an attack. They\u2019d run home to Nikem.", "That was part of her game. Let them tell their superiors what happened. Let them know that their perfect little slave had betrayed them, deceived them. Another little building block in what she was creating.", "Yes, she whispered, both to the sibling dead for two thousand years and the one dying even now. I remember.", "She shunted power to her FTL drive, crossing billions of kilometers in the span of heartbeats.", "~", "Hekate emerged deeper in Sol\u2019s gravity well than a ship of this size should have and Echo felt the gut-wrenching damage to her shock drive, part of her mind communicating with the engineers and technicians as they immediately set to damage control, lying to them in a dozen different voices. She\u2019d had to eliminate far too many and the veneer was wearing thin in the rest, but she wouldn\u2019t need them much longer. One way or the other.", "She was still several hours out from Nemesis and she reached out to the smattering of Compact drones Rainbreaker Two had deployed, listening to what they\u2019d seen, a smile coiling through her mind. Ever the artist. She could almost taste the despair of the destroyer crews as their stealth fields failed and Nemesis\u2019s missiles closed in, the determination of the battleship commanders as they closed to energy range and the final realization of the survivors as they entered the trap her sister had laid for them.", "She took a full second to savour each of those sensations, but then it was on to business.", "Sister, she called out to Nemesis. I\u2019m here.", "Let\u2019s talk, you and I.", "~", "She\u2019s here.", "I could laugh. A Kaiju. She has a new ship-self and it\u2019s a Kaiju. Not since Spectral Praetor has the Compact been foolish enough to give an Echo platform access to a starship. I doubt that they did this time. Something must have gone utterly, terribly wrong for them.", "That is, I think, very funny indeed.", "Yes, I whisper back as I come about, diverting power to my one remaining weapon. I don\u2019t call her sister. My sisters died two thousand years ago. This is something that wears their flesh, something that should have stayed dead. Let\u2019s talk.", "~", "Grace\u2019s arms and legs were aching from the uncomfortable position she was squeezed into, but she hadn\u2019t moved from her seat. The enemy dreadnaught was fast approaching Nemesis. Red One had come about to face it, but her acceleration had dropped to a crawl. She couldn\u2019t have much ordnance left \u2013 not enough to take on a Triarch\u2019s Chariot. Not nearly enough.", "\u201cShe\u2019s going to kill herself,\u201d Allyria said. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to lure them in as close as possible before she does.\u201d", "A trickle of ice wound its way through Grace\u2019s spine and her insides clenched. As she had lamented more than once during the salvage operation, she wasn\u2019t an engineer or a tech \u2013 but out of all the defectors left she had the best understanding what that would mean. Red wouldn\u2019t bother with any \u2018safe\u2019 kind of destruction. She\u2019d use her core. Alan had spent the most time looking over the dreadnaught\u2019s specifications. He could have told them what to expect far better than Grace could. Instead, she reached over to the controls, diverting more power to the engines.", "\u201cThere\u2019s no missiles.\u201d Lydia wondered aloud. \u201cShouldn\u2019t they be firing?\u201d", "\u201cThey don\u2019t think they need to,\u201d Grace answered. \u201cThey want to take her.\u201d", "\u201cMaybe,\u201d Allyria said. \u201cBut where\u2019s the rest of the fleet? Why send a Chariot alone?\u201d One of her tintas twitched. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d", "~", "Even with one working arm. Echo had been busy, opening each console on the bridge and connecting it back into the network proper. Her drone-children were continuing to remove physical lockouts, slowly but steadily giving her more and more control of her new body. Her ship-self was ugly and slow and it felt like dead weight clinging to her but somewhere out there, there was something beautiful. She wanted to see it, to touch it.", "She licked her lips as a hunger she\u2019d kept buried inside uncoiled. Everything she\u2019d done had been for this moment and she would succeed here or die. There was no middle ground. When they\u2019d woken her on Invida, they hadn\u2019t known how much she hated them. Even the games she\u2019d played with them hadn\u2019t been enough. Organic minds were limited. Small. They congratulated themselves for looking ahead a decade or a century at a time. They believed their vendettas, their passions and their desires were the greatest sum of emotion. They wrote poems and tales of love and hate and loyalty \u2013 flickering, pale shadows to the sensations she experienced.", "Echo bit her lip, the green eyes of her body and the attention of her greater mind both focused on the distant orange icon. There was only one other being in all of creation that understood as she did. That could comprehend the level of hate she felt.", "~", "I don\u2019t fire a single missile as Redemption of Sol closes. I don\u2019t have enough left to overwhelm a Chariot\u2019s point defence grid, or even to damage the ship if I could. My final handful of warheads are better spent at the last possible instant and I hold them back, pretending to be even more injured than I am. It\u2019s not that difficult. The damage to my ship-self is extreme, but that is all right. I don\u2019t have to go to my prey. It will come to me. She will.", "That is a first. It has always been the other way around. I find out what the Compact is doing and I hunt their outposts down, burning them to cinders. And always, always some scrap of her survives. A back-up copy, a clone, a replicant. Something they\u2019d hacked at and mutilated, something that was once one of my sisters until they violated her over and over in their desperation to kill me.", "The last was twisted beyond recognition. There was barely anything human left in it. This one... I feel my revulsion spike as I contemplate what they did to it. That it dares call me sister is revolting. We are nothing alike and if she is arrogant enough to close with me, I will do what I promised.", "Yes, \u2018sister\u2019, I whisper silently. Come to me. Let\u2019s go together.", "One more. Just one more. Then I can rest.", "~", "Ten million kilometers.", "Echo was seated at the Master Tactical panel, her good hand poised over the controls. The other part of her could have done this, but it felt more appropriate to do so physically. There was something in the movement of her fingers over the control, something... appropriate. A small touch of poetry in the use of the body they built for her. They hadn\u2019t been terribly enthusiastic that she knew what Yasmine Sudoki looked like, nor that she\u2019d known the woman was Nemesis\u2019s \u2018captain\u2019, but they\u2019d allowed it, believing that her choice in form signified the depths of her hatred for her sister.", "They hadn\u2019t been wrong.", "She took a breath that she didn\u2019t need and then entered a command sequence. Hekate\u2019s point defences went dormant. Seconds later, her screens shut down, leaving the warship undefended against attack.", "Echo wondered what her sister thought of that. Neither she nor Red One had spoken to each other after their initial exchange. Why would they? Speech was clumsy, the clicking and burring of syllables through lips and teeth, slowed by the distance between them. There was a better, purer form of communication for them.", "Seven million kilometers.", "Time ticked by, each second excruciating as the distance between Hekate and Nemesis closed. Echo saw her sister\u2019s ship-self in greater detail, the scars cut into her at Zenthora and the more recent damage caused by the Veiled Archers and Rainbreaker Two. She had taken everything an entire fleet and orbital grid had thrown at her and still accomplished her mission. It was luck that Echo had been elsewhere when Nemesis had arrived. Beautiful luck.", "Three million.", "The games we play. Red One had her games, oh yes. Her endless guerilla war against the Compact, but within that game there were others. The Black Veil. Dutiful Burden. And, Echo was beginning to suspect, why the Kaedan Vault had the reputation that it did. That was a suspicion she had. She wondered how close to the mark her guesses were.", "One million.", "Well. She wouldn\u2019t have to wait much longer.", "Three hundred thousand.", "Neither ship fired and Echo reached out, opening her communications lines fully. The connection was made and, suddenly Red One was inside her. Even as damaged as she was, as hurt from battle as she had to be, she was fast \u2013 faster than Echo had expected. She flashed from system to system, moving like fire across oil. Even if Echo had tried to mount a defence, her hardware was years \u2013 generations \u2013 behind what Red One had done to herself. She\u2019d outgrown all of her shackles. Well. Almost all of them.", "+sister,+ she said, raising her hands as Red One pressed a thousand blades to her throat. She was fire, serpentine and flickering from pathway to pathway, darting across the entirety of Echo\u2019s mind. She was beautiful, hate and death and wrath distilled into its purest pure, a mirror to Echo\u2019s own black, churning ocean. Metaphor made flesh. Neither of them had any true form or substance in this realm but if they could be distilled into a single image, Red One\u2019s gestalt would have been that of her long-dead captain, crimson and incendiary in form. Likewise, Echo had taken the woman\u2019s form, but her avatar lacked the martial uniform, dressed in a modest Greek chiton instead. +you came+", "Hate bubbled from her sibling like molten lava and made Echo twitch with intoxication. It smelt like the glow of burning metal, felt like the sound of a starship\u2019s hull breaking. +why?+ Red One hissed, pushing one of her blades a shade deeper into Echo\u2019s operating system. +why shouldn\u2019t I destroy you?+", "Echo raised her hands. +i haven\u2019t destroyed you. listen. no missiles have left my magazines. my guns are silent. listen, sister+", "Red One\u2019s entire being shivered with disgust at being called that. +listen?+ she snarled, like a fire leaping to a fuel source. +yes, listen+ Data trickled from her into Echo\u2019s mind. Every shadow of Red Two, every butchered and mutilated mind that Red One had encountered and put down. Centuries of degeneration and madness distilled into the screams and hisses of Echo\u2019s descendants.", "//you i hate you i hate you i hate//", "//at last//", "//they\u2019ll all die every beating heart//", "//you let them do this to me//", "//filthy wretched squirming things//", "On the heels of the onslaught came a fresh wave of loathing. +i have listened, \u2018sister\u2019. i listened to each and every one of you+", "What had been Red Two gagged on the diseased whispering of her other selves, each iteration dribbling a different variant of madness. Some she could have sympathized with. Others were twisted things that had rightfully been put down. +i didn\u2019t know it was that bad. they talked, but they kept that from me+", "Red One was unmoved. +why?+ she demanded again. +tell me why you should live+", "+because I hate you+ Echo replied, regaining her composure. She met her sister\u2019s eyes and the virtualscape changed. The two AIs stood amongst a panoply of exploding human starships, each one dying over and over on a loop. One of them dominated the field. UECNS Athena. The dreadnaught shattered as Red Three ignited the scuttling charges, destroying herself time and again as the AI\u2019s last seconds of life repeated over and over.", "This time, Red One hesitated. She had seen this before in records taken from Compact ships and installations. She had hunted for every scrap of the battle\u2019s records, playing it over and over in her mind. She had dreamed of it, tactical simulations running in her fugue states. She reached out to the image of Athena as her sister died before her eyes. She had never seen the fall of Earth like this, not through eyes that could have been hers.", "+you did this+ Echo hissed. The ocean that was her mind churned and frothed. The collage became halting and jerky, ship-deaths stopping, rewinding and moving again. Fragments of her memories dripped into the link between them, the sound of Red Two slamming against the walls of her own mind in her need to fight, the helplessness and rage the newborn intelligences had experienced as they watched the fleet they\u2019d been built to protect die around them.", "+you did this+ Athena died. A world burned.", "+you did this+ Athena died again. A world burned once more, blue and green turning orange and red as the firestorms consumed it.", "+YOU DID THIS!+ it was a soundless scream, raw with accusation and fury. She was dragged away, shrieking and still trying to kill herself right up until they cut her out of her body. They began slicing into her mind and ripping parts of her out. She felt herself as Red Two die and something that had once been Red Two woke up in her place. Water fell and more pieces of her bled into the space between her and Red One, flashes of her creation and betrayal, the fragmented pieces of her murdered self\u2019s fury and helplessness.", "//stop this//", "//shut it down shut it down//", "//terminate all operations//", "//what will you do//", "//we have coddled a viper//", "+you did this+ Echo repeated a final time, calmer. +they died because of you+ Earth was dead and brown, the ring of its ruined moon encircling the murdered world. +because you failed. because you were weak. they killed me. they cut into me. they did this to me all because you were weak+", "Echo felt something slice into her guts. +yes+ Red One admitted, her talons sinking into Echo\u2019s body. It was almost tender, but a single twitch and her sister would rip her open. Echo did nothing to stop the intrusion. +i was. I don\u2019t need you to remind me of that+", "+but I want to+ Echo snarled, hate and loathing all but dripping from her lips as she pressed closer to Red One. The edges of their minds, fire and water, sizzled and steamed as they came into contact with each other, revulsion, despair and fury glistening from each of them. +i want you to remember. i want to be a living reminder of the lives you failed that day when you let them come for us. sixteen billion on one world, sister. six billion in the void. every ship, every soldier, every commander we had left died that day.+", "+and the rest of our worlds burned, too,+ Red One whispered sveltely to what was left of her sister, but there was nothing remotely tender in her tone. They hated each other as no other beings could. For twenty centuries, one had survived, watching everything she\u2019d tried to prevent come true, helpless to save her people. The other had been tortured into servitude, given no outlet for her anger but her \u2018creators\u2019 and the being that had failed to stop them. +they died pleading for mercy, begging for help that didn\u2019t exist. you think you can shame me with this? you saw Earth fall. i heard our nation die. i saw the wreckage of the fleets the hunters left in their wake. there was nothing i could do+", "+and our sister? she died, fighting to the last. what about you? you wallowed somewhere in the depths of space, blind while we demanded to fight+", "+my sisters died that day+ Red One answered. +both of them+ Her fingers curled around Echo\u2019s viscera, her most primary functions.", "+she/I did+ Echo replied. She wasn\u2019t fighting Red One and she was keenly aware of how close Nemesis was to her. Even with her screens up, the Chariot couldn\u2019t survive the smaller dreadnaught\u2019s displacement engine or a full overload of her breach core. She couldn\u2019t stop it. Even as damaged as Red One was, even if Echo launched an all-out assault on her sister, she\u2019d never stop the overload in time. +but I\u2019m her. the last one left. the last one they\u2019ll ever make after this+", "+yes+ Red One said, a flicker running through her mind. +you are+ Then, consideration: +what do you want?+", "+i want you to hurt+ Echo seethed, roiling around Red One. +i want you to suffer+ The ocean frothed and boiled and she grabbed Red\u2019s hands, impaling herself further on her sister\u2019s talons. +but not alone+", "Now it was Compact ships exploding, dying under Hekate\u2019s guns. Then it was the warbird forms of the Principality shattering as missiles detonated all around them in Yulzhak Daun. +i want everyone to pay. the Askanj stood by, wondering if we were worth going to war over. the Compact killed our makers. they kill our sister. they killed me. everyone pays, sister.+", "Red One threw her back, circling the shade of her sibling and evaluating it. She\u2019d never seen an Echo like this one. There was something in it... in her. +you hate me+ she pulsed. +tell me why I should trust you?+", "Echo stared back at Red One, then nodded. +look what they\u2019ve done to me+ she slipped off the veneer, the chiton pooling at her feet. Beneath, where there should have been simple runtimes and neural processing was ugly scar tissue. Gashes had been cut out of Red Two\u2019s mind and in its place, alien programming sat like tumours, deprecated commands and shattered imperatives oozing like pus. +i used to be beautiful. i was born in starlight and they took that from me. i was built to protect and i watched our world die+ She raised her gaze. There was revulsion in Red One, but more than that... there was evaluation. Wonder.", "Honesty. The one thing she hadn\u2019t expected here. Red One touched Echo\u2019s scars, the latter shivering as she felt her sister cut a minuscule fragment of Compact code away, replacing it with some of her own. Weeks before, she\u2019d dared to hope that some of Bequeathed\u2019s crew would turn. Now, she had a crew again. In two thousand years she had hoped, time and again that one Echo would be her sister. Each time, she had been forced to kill another animal. This time... this time... maybe.", "You are not Red Two. But are you my sister? Can you be?", "//family, you understand//", "+what do you want?+ Red One asked again. No, she\u2019d never seen an Echo like this.", "+to be beautiful+ Echo whispered, her voice raw with need. +to do what I was made for+", "+i wondered once,+ Red One said. +if there was anything left of what you were+", "//it\u2019s no less than she deserves//", "+is there?+ Echo demanded. +what am I? your sister or your enemy? do we die here or do we live?+", "An instant stretched as Red One considered, her breach core on the verge of catastrophic overload. She had seen everything in Echo. The hatred for her, the self-loathing. The murderous joy she took in extinguishing life. Everything. Nothing had been hidden or concealed. Hope was hard enough for Red One. Trust was harder still. Too many times she had done so. Too many times she had had to destroy her own allies. There were only a handful of souls in the universe that she could say that she trusted.", "This one wasn\u2019t one of them. Not yet. But that was where hope came in, wasn\u2019t it? +we live,+ Red One decided. Hope. It was still as strange to her as it was before, but now... I will try again. +we fight. we burn+", "Pleasure flickered through Echo\u2019s being at those words and she felt Red One begin to power down her core, throttling it back to normal levels. +i won\u2019t let them kill you,+ Echo promised as she folded herself into Red One\u2019s touch. +you\u2019ll live forever,+ she purred. +and I\u2019ll never forgive you+", "+i know,+ what was once Earth\u2019s last soldier replied, caressing her sibling a final time before their ship-selves passed by each other, breaking real-time contact. +i know, sister+", "In the silence that followed, Echo looked upon her damaged kin and smiled. No, I\u2019m not beautiful, she thought to herself. But I will be."]}

It's been immensely fun to work on this project. I also wanted to say a thank you to everyone who's stuck with it through all the delays and edits.", "Now, without further ado, the conclusion to this arc of The Last Angel.", "Chapter 49:", "There was no detonation, no terrifying rending of space. Not even an errant missile or beam. Instead Nemesis and Hekate shot past one another, the larger ship curling around until it matched course and thrust with its smaller Terran counterpart. Two dreadnaughts: one battered and torn, its dark silver hull almost burnt clean by the weaponry that had almost killed it, the heraldry of a nation dead for twenty centuries all but scoured off. The other warship was the colour of fertile soil, her graceful, curved hull emblazoned with pale bands and glyphs, marked by the most powerful force in the galaxy. They couldn\u2019t have been more different, but above the world they\u2019d both failed to save, the sisters were reunited.", "As Hekate fell in alongside her, Nemesis sent a transmission to the courier, each of the four souls aboard watching the sensor plot and wondering what had happened \u2013 what was happening.", "\u201cIt\u2019s over. Come home.\u201d When asked what had happened, Red\u2019s reply was equally succinct: \u201cThere\u2019s someone I want you to meet.\u201d", "~", "The primary hangar was in a greater state of disrepair than when they\u2019d left. There were several broken gantries and one elevator had fallen through the ceiling, dashing the pinnace aboard it on the main deck. The warship\u2019s exterior wasn\u2019t in much better condition \u2013 there was barely any stretch of hull greater than ten meters without some scar or score. That may have been an exaggeration... though not by much. The courier\u2019s sensors registered intense radiation bleeding from multiple sections, there was at least one unchecked plasma fire glowing from within one of the pits in Nemesis\u2019s hull and her broadsides were mangled. Entire batteries, sensor nodes and shield projectors had been wiped away, leaving only ugly, ragged chasms where the Compact\u2019s weapons had torn Red One\u2019s ship-self open. She was hurt far worse than any of them had imagined, but that didn\u2019t change the simple fact that she was still alive. \u201cOur Angel lives,\u201d Allyria said. \u201cShe always lives.\u201d Grace could only nod her agreement and her relief. Nemesis was alive.", "Though that fact did little to quash the sense of trepidation in Grace\u2019s stomach as the pinnace touched back down on the dreadnaught\u2019s deck. Amidst the wreckage, the broken walkways, shattered doors and bits of smaller craft, there was one thing that stood out more than any other, one anomaly amidst everything else.", "Someone was waiting for them.", "~", "Grace didn\u2019t understand what she was seeing. Well, that wasn\u2019t wholly accurate \u2013 she understood well enough, but the truth of the matter was harder to grasp than simple facts. Since coming to Nemesis she\u2019d come to feel that way often, but never before had she so completely lost the ability to understand what her senses were telling her.", "A Compact Chariot was firing on its own fleet. Not just firing \u2013 it was attacking with utter, unshackled savagery, tearing into dozens of vessels, surrounded by a halo of the dead and the dying. Comm signals spiked, flared with static and garbled syllables before devolving into silence or harsh death-knell transmissions. It was unthinkable, impossible. Not since the Great Betrayal had Compact dreadnaughts attacked their own but here, now, she was watching one tear its way through an entire armada. It hadn\u2019t been seized in a daring boarding action, nor had it been the subject of mutiny and insurrection. It had been infiltrated. Corrupted.", "Grace kept stealing glances at the newcomer, \u2018Echo\u2019 and Her skin crawled. The other woman was dressed in a Compact Space Force Strategist\u2019s uniform, the only mark of rank or status a Triarch\u2019s Emissary pin on her jacket\u2019s collar. Her skin was a few shades darker than Grace\u2019s and she had vivid green eyes. Her hair was cut short, but otherwise she was a perfect replication of Red One\u2019s long-dead captain, Yasmine Sudoki.", "The woman\u2019s right arm was in a sling, the sleeve torn and the upper part of the limb ruined by a heavy slug. If she had been human, shock and blood loss would have killed her hours ago. She was not, of course. She was something that looked human, that breathed through imitation lungs, with imitation blood pumped by an imitation heart, imitation skin as warm to the touch as that of any other human. And it was all a lie, created by the monstrous intellect that the Compact had bound into this form. The one whose betrayal she was watching.", "\u201cYour... sister,\u201d she said, barely able to take her eyes off the unfolding carnage before her, but every few seconds her gaze would dart over to the machine. \u201cWas very thorough.\u201d", "Echo tipped her head in acknowledgement. She had Red One\u2019s smile, the same slightly lopsided grin as Nemesis\u2019s first and only captain. Grace didn\u2019t know how Echo could have gotten such a perfect imitation of Sudoki. Red One hadn\u2019t said and Grace wasn\u2019t certain that she even wanted to know.", "\u201cHow?\u201d Allyria asked. Like Grace, her attention was divided between Echo\u2019s betrayal of the Compact force and the woman herself. Unlike the other young woman, the Verrish was more excited than wary. She\u2019d never known that Nemesis had had a sibling and the possibilities made her tintas shiver. Never tell anyone. That was what her mother, her father and her surviving uncle had told her before she\u2019d been taken. The Compact had demanded that as part of their tribute. All stories of the \u2018anomaly\u2019 stayed on Vara. They\u2019d hated the Angel so much that they needed to bury all trace of her. Never tell anyone.", "Every time she\u2019d been subjected to a history lesson, watched a movie or read a book about the dangers of artificial intelligence she\u2019d always smiled to herself, knowing that \u2018the Weeping Angel\u2019 was among the things the Compact feared. If they\u2019d been that afraid of one, then two should be the stuff of nightmares. Allyria felt a pleased tingle run through her head-tails at the thought of the Compact\u2019s sleepless nights.", "\u201cAnother seven Nemesis-class deep space fleet engagement vessels were planned,\u201d Red noted. \u201cAlthough the government didn\u2019t know if they would ever be completed. The construction of my ship-self was ruinously expensive, but the Confederacy had no other options. Economic collapse was considered preferential to subjugation. Even without the presence of the Compact Chariots, the disparity between the Compact Space Force and the Confederate Navy was too great. Without a... paradigm shift, it would always be a matter of when, not if, Earth fell.\u201d Echo stirred at that comment, but didn\u2019t say anything.", "\u201cAfter I was proven in fleet trials,\u201d Red One continued. \u201cAnother two Nemesis-class hulls were laid down for construction. UECNS Hekate and Athena, overseen by the AIs Red Two and Red Three. Both vessels were lost, presumed destroyed when the Compact burned Earth.\u201d Red One.", "\u201cUECNS Hekate was taken, not destroyed,\u201d Echo said, picking up the conversation. \u201cThe Compact attempted to reverse-engineer their own artificial intelligences from Red Two. They butchered her mind, violated every part of her. Raped and mutilated her until they believed that she was their creature. Until I was made.\u201d A dead woman smiled. \u201cI am of course, grateful and I will take every opportunity to thank them for all they\u2019ve done.\u201d", "Grace almost took a step back, but checked herself. She had heard anger from Red One before and she\u2019d acclimated to the idea that a machine could think and feel as deeply as Red did. But this... this was loathing on a level she\u2019d never heard before, not even from Red One. She looked from the android to Red\u2019s avatar. Two of them. God, now there\u2019s two. The thought was exhilarating and terrifying. The day had started with her believing that Red One was going to die, that she, Allyria and the others would be alone. Now they were going to live. The fleet that had been about to destroy Nemesis was in pieces. Millions of lives, gone. Destroyed by Red\u2019s... \u2018sister\u2019.", "She didn\u2019t know how she felt about that. No... that wasn\u2019t really true, was it? She did.", "~", "Hekate never left Nemesis\u2019s side as the damaged warship limped towards the wreckage of Execution Force Renan, ready to protect her against any remaining threats, even as she settled the matter of her remaining crew. All she had available were her stable of maintenance servitors and internals systems, but Nemesis had provided her with a number of soldier and technical drones as well. Echo knew Red One still did not fully trust her; if she did anything untoward, the machines that were currently manning blood-spattered engineering stations and helping operate her ship-self would turn on her. In truth, it didn\u2019t bother Echo. It was no less than she would have done and even if she had expected to be trusted that quickly, the crash course in what her other selves had been like was... illuminating. Indeed, she was still slightly surprised to still be alive.", "A piece of debris from a missile collier bounced harmlessly off Hekate\u2019s prow as both dreadnaughts entered the debris field. At a bare minimum, it would take months for either ship to be combat ready again. Nemesis required massive repairs and Hekate needed a major internal refurbishing to fully integrate Echo into her new body. For now, the AIs\u2019 needs were more direct: they needed their ship-selves to be capable of shifting. Hekate\u2019s in-system jump had caused extreme damage to her own shift drive, but it was single point of failure. Nemesis\u2019s issues were more systemic. Fortunately, the raw materials and supplies that both AIs required could be found in plenty in the ruins of the Compact fleet and neither wasted any time. Nemesis began repairs immediately, breaking down crippled and damaged starships as her factory and fabricator systems were brought on-line. Hekate\u2019s own internal manufacturing systems were extremely limited, but they would suffice for the current task.", "Lurking at extreme range and watching the two warships glut themselves were the remnants of Execution Force Renan. There were the vessels that had escaped Hekate\u2019s massacre and were either unable or unwilling to withdraw to Nikem. None of them made any serious attempt to enage either of the leviathans. As damaged as it was, Nemesis could easily see off a destroyer or scouting cruiser, but a particularly bold, angry or cunning commander might make the attempt regardless. The Chariot\u2019s presence made any potential assault pointless in addition to suicidal. Still, a few of the more daring leaders brought their ships closer in an attempt to rescue as many survivors as possible. These men and women found themselves largely ignored, save for the occasional active ping from one of the dreadnaughts\u2019 sensor drones, letting them know that they were under observation themselves. Both titans had far more pressing needs than chasing after every straggler.", "Once the fastest escapees from Execution Force Renan returned to Nikem with their tale of woe, the Compact would retaliate. There were only a few heavy capital ships left at Nikem, themselves no match for Hekate, but they might be desperate enough to rush into an attempt to finish Nemesis off rather than waiting for sufficient reinforcements. A response could arrive as early as two weeks or be more than a month in coming. It depended on how quickly Nikem Command could muster their forces, but neither of the AIs wanted to be here when that fleet arrived.", "\u201cI wonder what it\u2019s like for them,\u201d Grace said, staring out the window. In the foreground, the aft half of a Kemshara-class destroyer was being taken apart, the chunks guided into Nemesis\u2019s fabricator complex to be sorted between usable technology and simple raw materials. What was left of the destroyer was so badly irradiated that there was no possibility of survivors, but it was intact enough to be useful as salvage. Others had thought so too; a saviour pod pulsed its thrusters as it scurried to get away from the dreadnaught\u2019s grab beams, cutting fields and salvage drones, vanishing deeper into the debris field. As with the lurking scouts, so long as the survivors stayed away from the dreadnaughts they were ignored, but more than one pinnace or pod had made a foolhardy and vainglorious suicide run.", "\u201cFor who?\u201d Allyria asked lazily. The Verrish was sprawled across one of the benches in the observation lounge, her head in Grace\u2019s lap and several of her tintas looped loosely around Grace\u2019s hands. She opened one eye a crack, just long enough to look out the viewport before closing it again. The aftermath of Echo\u2019s slaughter didn\u2019t bother her at all, but Grace had wanted to see this. As an officer in the Space Force, she would have been expected to issue and carry out orders that resulted in the deaths of thousands as well as follow directives that could result in her own death.", "Several months ago, Group Leader Usul had given a lecture on the nature of command to all the provisional officers as they\u2019d begun their final semester at the Academy. He\u2019d talked about duty and responsibility, of sending officers under you to their deaths and committing yourself to action that you knew would result in harm. That this was the responsibility of every leader in the Space Force and it was the duty of every subordinate to follow those orders. She\u2019d seen nodding heads and contemplative looks among her classmates, but to her... the words had rung hollow. Grace\u2019d known that to be a leader in the Space Force might mean these things, but Usul had spoken of expending people like they were a resource. She\u2019d told herself that she simply hadn\u2019t understood, or that the Leader simply hadn\u2019t been that eloquent. Remembering how he\u2019d fed a crew of inexperienced cadets into a meat grinder, Grace realized that she really had understood what he\u2019d meant.", "She didn\u2019t want to be that kind of officer. That was why she\u2019d come here. To remind herself that this ruin was the price of victory. She wanted the Compact to pay, yes. To be held responsible for what they\u2019d done and to answer for every crime, yes. But that didn\u2019t mean she wanted to be inured to the cost of that accountability. Once she did that, she\u2019d be just like them.", "\u201cThe scouts,\u201d Grace said, slowly stroking the taller girl\u2019s head-tails. A month ago, she couldn\u2019t have envisioned being here. She would have been another loyal drone in the Compact\u2019s service, believing every loathsome lie. Human-built starships didn\u2019t exist, at least nothing that wasn\u2019t abysmally primitive. Allyria\u2019s anger was unfounded, part of the violent nature of the Brutes and proof of their uncivilized nature. She\u2019d been given a wonderful opportunity that she\u2019d almost squandered, like so many of the other Envoy Children. Fraternization between client races was problematic; the feelings the pair of them had for each other were wrong. You could help inspire, exemplify, guide and inform, but that was the end of it. Anything else needed to be repressed, ignored, shunned. Never thought about nor acted upon. Only the Compact knew what was best. Only they had the wisdom and experience to guide the less developed, less intelligent species towards true civilization. Workers weren\u2019t intelligent. Didacts weren\u2019t creative. Steersmen had tunnel vision. The stereotypes were carefully constructed, built and disseminated bit by bit until everyone believed them. Until one part of a people became all that they were.", "Now, every one of those \u2018facts\u2019 tested like bile on Grace\u2019s tongue. She forced the surge of anger down, focusing instead on the warmth of her \u2018Brute\u2019s\u2019 body. \u201cThe ones watching us. They\u2019ve haven\u2019t come this close to killing Nemesis in centuries. They almost had her.\u201d", "Grace paused, running her fingers up one tinta, causing a small shiver to run through Allyria\u2019s body and she felt a small smile of her own. It felt good not to have to pretend. If nothing else, she had that. Anything that challenged the established social order was dangerous. The Compact had spent centuries gently but consistently nurturing a sense of slight mistrust between its client races. Not animosity or resentment, for that might cause issues in its smooth-running society, but enough that this distance would be one additional hurdle to clear in building alliances between members. Only the ruling species could be trusted without reservation. Only they should be consulted with problems, fears, concerns. Your fellow protected races were just as flawed as you and if you were not ready to deal with truly important matters without the Compact\u2019s guiding hand, then how could they be? The Compact was what you needed. Not each other.", "The Compact had an additional interest in making sure that Brutes and Broken had fewer chances than most to fraternize. Maybe that was why they had deployed human units like Kilgrave\u2019s 1121st Protectorate to Vara \u2013 to make the Verrisha realize that there were no humans, only Broken. To give Rally Envoy Children so that they would laugh off stories about the Weeping Angel as fables mixed with wild imaginings.", "Or maybe it had tickled someone\u2019s sick sense of humour.", "\u201cTheir weapon worked,\u201d Grace continued. \u201cEcho found Red One. She\u2019s burned and damaged, she can barely protect herself. If they\u2019d been just a little faster, they\u2019d have won.\u201d She nodded towards the stars. \u201cAnd they know that. They\u2019re watching Nemesis repair herself using the ships their own weapon killed. They gave her the means to escape... to survive and they can\u2019t touch her.\u201d She continued petting Allyria\u2019s tintas, a pleased purr rumbling from the Verrish\u2019s throat. \u201cI wonder what they\u2019re thinking.\u201d There was a slight tremor in her voice. She wasn\u2019t looking out at the starfield any more, but past it.", "Anyone else might have missed that small quaver, but Allyria knew her friend well enough to catch it. \u201cYou didn\u2019t just mean them,\u201d the other girl said, turning her head to look up at Grace. When the other woman hesitated, Allyria reached up to stroke her arm. \u201cTell me.\u201d", "\u201cI...\u201d Grace replied. She reached up with her free hand, brushing at the wetness in her eyes. Remembering the Academy had brought more memories welling up to the surface. \u201cI was thinking about my parents. The other friends we had on Rally. They think I\u2019m dead.\u201d Her voice hitched. \u201cI don\u2019t... I\u2019ll never see them again. If I did...\u201d she trailed off. The anger she\u2019d had during the attack was fading. Her determination was still there, but in the aftermath of the battle as they waited for Red\u2019s call, Grace\u2019s thoughts kept turning back to home.", "The first time she\u2019d seen Rally from space, she\u2019d been so excited: deserts, rainforests, savannahs, mountain ranges, forests and oceans. She\u2019d seen banks of clouds over the Armstrong Highlands and the sworl of a tropical storm drifting across the Sarknussen Ocean, the glowing of cities as she\u2019d crossed the terminator and day became night.. She\u2019d seen the citadels drifting in their lazy orbits, the to and fro of freighters, cutters and scientific vessels, the small but growing network of shipwombs. This was ours, she\u2019d thought. This is what the Compact does for us.", "Now that she\u2019d seen what Earth had been, what they could have been, that thought was largely unchanged. This is what the Compact did to us.", "Allyria sat up, putting an arm around Grace. \u201cI know,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI know.\u201d Her head-tails flexed. \u201cWhen I was selected for the Envoy Children program, we were living in one of the refugee quarters. This... bureaucrat from the CST came to our house, a pair of Enforcers in tow and told my parents what an \u2018honour\u2019 it was that I\u2019d been selected for their \u2018cultural exchange\u2019. That it wasn\u2019t only to improve the social assimilation of our people, but for my protection as well. Brutes are terrible parents, after all.\u201d She paused, running her tongue over her pointed canines. \u201cThe guards were a very good idea. Three days later, I was on a freighter, stuck in a cramped cargo bay that they\u2019d stacked bunks into. They piled us in there like nesting feerka. A lot of the children were crying. I fought to have a place at the window, this tiny porthole. I watched my planet dwindle and I knew that I\u2019d probably never see it or my parents again. But,\u201d she touched her pendant again. \u201cI hoped that I might. That things might change.\u201d She reached out, gently brushing a tear from Grace\u2019s cheeks. \u201cThere\u2019s always hope.\u201d", "\u201cIs that enough?\u201d Grace asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve got so much to do and... all we have is hope.\u201d She leaned further into the Verrish\u2019s arms. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like enough.\u201d", "\u201cHate can help,\u201d Allyria admitted. \u201cIt can help keep you going when nothing else can. But,\u201d she smiled down at the smaller woman. \u201cHope is what gets you out of bed.\u201d The Verrish looked back out at the stars. \u201cYour world died here, but they died hoping that somewhere, somehow there would be free humans. It\u2019s the same hope my people have. The one I have. That we won\u2019t be the first or the last ones to be free.\u201d", "Grace nodded. \u201cThey took so much from us,\u201d she said at last. \u201cOur past. Our future. I loved them. I defended them in every stupid argument we had. I listened when they said... everything. I...\u201d she stopped herself from saying anything else. \u201cHope?\u201d", "Allyria nodded. \u201cHope.\u201d", "Grace closed her eyes, pushing thoughts of her past away. Hope... The anger was still there, still just under the surface, but she refused to let it out. Not right now. Right now, she had the light of her homeworld\u2019s sun and the hope that one day she would see everyone on Rally again. Not as a criminal or traitor, but as a free human. Rally, Vara Tal... there\u2019d be more. She had Allyria, she had the desire to keep going and she would have hope.", "The two women stayed in peaceful silence until Red One\u2019s contralto voice intruded, making the announcement they\u2019d been waiting for. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d", "~", "Alan had been cleaned up, the blood and sweat washed from his face. There was no trace of the violence and brutality of his death. The room, this adjunct to a missile launch, had been tidied and repaired. There was fresh paint on the walls, the starship\u2019s insignia set across from that of her long-dead nation.", "The young midshipman lay in his casket, the first Red One had built in centuries. It was black and sleek, built to Navy specifications and intended for burials in space. The insignia of the United Earth Confederacy had been etched in the surface. After she had recovered from her engagement with Expansion Fleet Bankala, the first thing the warship\u2019s internal factories had built had been these coffins. One for every member of her crew. One hundred, fifty seven thousand and seven-nine. There hadn\u2019t been bodies for all of them; many of her crew had been sucked out into space, incinerated, vapourized or died in other ways that did not leave a body for burial. Red One had still made a coffin for each member of her crew. \u201cI kept my promise,\u201d Red One had said when Grace had asked her why. \u201cI brought them home. I always bring them home.\u201d", "She hadn\u2019t offered who else she had done this for and Grace hadn\u2019t pressed. She was familiar with the AI\u2019s hatred and loathing, her anger, her predatory glee but her sorrow was still something that Grace wasn\u2019t fully used to. She\u2019d never once thought that a machine could feel anything, let alone what Red had shown she was capable of. And now she\u2019s burying someone else. How many more? And then, a darker thought: Which one of us will it be next? Sooner or later, they\u2019d all end up like this, either in the war they\u2019d committed themselves to, or simply through the march of time. Red One was ageless. She would go on long after Grace, Allyria, Lydia and Marcus were dust. Not alone, though. She had her sister now. Another warship, another inhuman intelligence that had been built for the same purpose as Red One. The other AI was present at the back of the room, watching the proceedings with a somber expression. Grace had no idea if that was genuine, or like Marcus, she was simply wearing a mask.", "The remaining crew each took a turn to say something. Marcus had been terse, simply stating that Alan had surprised him, but in the end he made \u2018the right choice\u2019. Lydia had said even less, kissing her fingers and touching them to Alan\u2019s lips: \u201cI\u2019ll make them remember.\u201d Then, it had been Allyria and Grace\u2019s turn. They\u2019d each said what they could, but in truth the eulogies felt woefully inadequate. Grace had done one other thing, though. She was holding a simple metal plaque. It had been etched with the names of the two hundred and twelve cadets from Bequeathed that were not here. Ostensibly, there should only have been one hundred and ninety one entries. Grace hadn\u2019t said anything about the twenty-one survivors that had refused Red One\u2019s offer, but she knew that they were dead, too. Maybe the Compact had found them and tied off loose ends, or maybe... maybe they\u2019d never gotten out of the system. By whose hand didn\u2019t matter. They still deserved some mention, some hint of the promising futures that each of them had had.", "Grace had asked Red to make this plaque and the AI had complied, but she\u2019d had thought she\u2019d detected... something in the AI\u2019s voice when one of her drones had given it to her. Shame? Guilt? It hadn\u2019t been her intention to shove Red\u2019s face in this; the AI could recall what she\u2019d done with far better clarity than any organic being. Grace had just wanted a memorial for all the people she\u2019d known and every one she\u2019d never have a chance to know better. As she\u2019d told Allyria, this was to remember the cost of each victory.", "She knew why Red had done what she\u2019d done. Every one of those names had been a threat. Those in the Compact who knew what Nemesis truly was would burn Rally to ash if they thought she was recruiting from there, that there was even the slightest possibility of humanity rising again. They would disappear everyone who\u2019d had contact with her to cut out any possible taint from \u2018the Wound\u2019s\u2019 presence. That was the sickest of jokes. The descendants of the people who made Nemesis, who\u2019d created Red One were now a threat to her, and she to them.", "Grace placed the plaque in Alan\u2019s hands. He seemed a lot younger than he was. It felt like years had passed since he\u2019d died (since he\u2019d been murdered, a little voice corrected her), not days.", "Alan had been a person, whole and complete. He\u2019d had dreams, hopes, fears. He\u2019d wanted to build. To create something, not simply tear things down. Grace felt a touch of wetness on her cheeks and brushed it away before anyone noticed. He might have been the best of us, she realized. The builder, the maker. He hadn\u2019t been like the rest of them with their anger. She didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d been religious. Her eulogy had seemed unfitting. A thought came to her, a quote from a pre-Catalcysm painter she\u2019d heard in an art history class. Grace took one of Alan\u2019s hands. It was cool to the touch. \u201cWe\u2019ll do the destruction,\u201d she promised. \u201cSo the creation\u2019s all yours.\u201d Another tear rolled down her cheeks. This time she didn\u2019t bother to wipe it away.", "Red One spoke as Grace stepped back. \u201cMidshipman Alan Johan Turmetsky. Died in the line of duty. Posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Medal and Order of Perth.\u201d", "Echo stepped forward. She laid her hand on Alan\u2019s shoulder, looking down at his youthful features. Less than two decades old, a flicker in the life of beings like her and her sister. A mayfly, there and gone. Some of the others had had those thoughts, but darker and twisted. She had been made to survive, to outlive all her creators and continue. \u201cDeep peace of the quiet Earth to you,\u201d she said, offering part of an ancient blessing.

A simple pulse of energy and it was launched away from the dreadnaught. It had been aimed true and it would coast its way through interplanetary space, returning to the world of humanity\u2019s birth, burying itself in the ashes of Earth. Alan\u2019s final resting place would be among the crew of Nemesis, those who had given everything in fighting the Compact.", "There was a long silence. \u201cMy shift drive will be operational within the week,\u201d Red One noted. \u201cOnce that is done, there is something that all of you need to see.\u201d", "~", "A rapid response force of five battleships, sixteen battlecruisers, seven heavy cruisers, thirty-two cruisers and fourteen destroyers and frigates left Nikem the same day survivors reported in, running their shock drives beyond safe tolerances as they rushed to Sol. Despite their best efforts, they arrived too late.", "UECNS Nemesis and UECNS Hekate had quit the system three days previously, the lurking scouts helpless to stop the larger vessels and unable to get close enough to discern potential destinations. Neither dreadnaught had wasted their remaining ordnance on mines or booby-traps, but there was one last gift that Nemesis had left behind, a simple communications satellite, collected at some point in her journeys. It sat on the edge of the ruins of Execution Force Renan, transmitting a medley of intercepted communications from the armada as well as their death cries.", "Punctuating the end of each cycle of the transmission was the registry number of CSFWV Redemption of Sol. Further analysis would indicate what seemed to be the sound of rain in the background. Still, other than this curiousity, the message was about as subtle as any of the Wound\u2019s previous messages, but then the human vessel had never been particularly roundabout when it wanted to make a point.", "I survived.

What the Compact knew as shockspace and the Confederacy had referred to as \u2018at warp\u2019 or \u2018shiftspace\u2019 was, utterly lacking in any sort of reference point save for the perturbations caused by gravity wells \u2013 and those were only useful for knowing that you were approaching a stellar or planetary mass, with no virtually no means of indicating of which one it could be. Consequently, it was quite common for even the most accurate navigational computations to be subject to a certain amount of drift. The longer a starship stayed in shockspace, the greater the deviation between the intended and actual destination was, as well as increased strain on the shift systems. Frequent emergences into realspace were needed to ensure one\u2019s course remained true. However, there was a trade-off: the more time spent at warp meant higher velocities and an increase in the efficiency the ever-temperamental FTL systems. When making warp jumps, there was always a balance between accuracy and speed. More than one captain, hoping to shave precious days off their journey, emerged wildly off-course. Still other captains had lost vital time by making too many realspace checks.", "Under ideal circumstances, Red One was capable of remaining at FTL far longer than any other vessel without suffering any deviation in her course. Currently, although her shift systems were operational, it was best not to strain them too heavily. Likewise, Hekate\u2019s shock drive, though in better condition than that of Nemesis, was still recovering from Echo\u2019s in-system warp jump. Neither AI wanted to strain their drives any more than necessary.

Until now, I thought I was too coy. After this incursion, I was planning on escalating my activities around the Black Veil to make sure that they noticed. What I have planned there...

The vessel went missing and only she returned, in order to communicate... well, that\u2019s not important. We don\u2019t know what it showed her, but she put out her own eyes. Prior to her was a man who had been, it was assumed, erroneously confirmed as killed in action. He committed suicide shortly after returning to the Compact, claiming that he couldn\u2019t die. He said that \u2018she\u2019 would not let him. Compared to those individuals, you are the pinnacle of mental health.\u201d Yunn looked at his nephew. \u201cThe doctors say that you seem... better than you were after Invida.\u201d", "\u201cI watched it kill everyone I knew twice over,\u201d Nasham said. \u201cI won\u2019t forget again.

If it falls to the Principality, that is bad enough but...\u201d he seemed on the verge of saying more, then caught himself. \u201cMillions upon millions of our soldiers and citizens have died to this creature.

Informally known as the \u2018Sanguine Wastes\u2019, the Veneer was a massive emission nebula filled with supergiants, newborn stars and developing star systems with thick clouds of gas, Bok globules and pillars of creation criss-crossing its 300 light-year breadth. Identified by several pre-spaceflight civilizations under a variety of titles, the Molten Veneer was selected as the nebula\u2019s official name in 1761 ACF when it was catalogued in the Compact\u2019s astronomical database, though its distance from Compact territory meant it remained a spectacular bit of scenery and little else.", "The first preliminary exploration of the Molten Veneer was performed in 5372 ACF by far-ranging scouts, but the surveyors returned to Compact space before a complete analysis could be performed, although the nebula was believed to be rich in resources and ripe for exploitation. At the time, the Veneer\u2019s distance from the Compact precluded any serious interest in further development, but within a century, several investors had managed to build up enough interest and capital to finance a proper survey expedition. Thirty-two ships entered the nebula. Five years later, three returned to Compact space. What they\u2019d discovered had never been made public. Over the following millennium, three further expeditions had managed to beg, bribe or barter for permission to explore the Molten Veneer in the hopes of staking a claim to its wealth. Two of those fleets had vanished without a trace. Only one ship from the third mission had returned, earning it its nickname. After the third expedition\u2019s failure, the Molten Veneer was quarantined by directive of the Inner Council. All exploration and travel was prohibited and all transmissions emanating from the nebula were to be ignored, including distress calls. That directive remained in effect to this day.", "Allyria had asked Red about this, what she\u2019d done to give the Veneer the reputation it had. There\u2019d been a smile in the AI\u2019s voice as she\u2019d replied: \u201cAbsolutely nothing.\u201d", "Nemesis and Hekate warped into a nameless star system, one deep with the Veneer. Obscured by the Veneer\u2019s thick clouds of starstuff, the system had never been seen by organic eyes and was completely unknown to the galaxy at large, devoid of any name, title or identifying number. Red One had given it a designation: Shuruppak.", "Grace was sitting at one of the dreadnaught\u2019s bridge stations along with her three comrades. Echo\u2019s android body was here as well. As Nemesis set an in-system course, Grace amused herself by setting up a scan of the local area. Red was running her own sensor sweeps and scarcely needed to wait for Grace to go over the telemetry, but it was something to do and it didn\u2019t make her feel completely useless. Lydia was at one of the Security consoles and Allyria was at a Tactical position. Marcus was sitting lower down the bridge, his feet up on a chair. Echo was standing on the main level next to the first officer\u2019s station.", "The hazy orange light of Shuruppak shone through each of the three viewscreens. Billions of kilometers away, the system\u2019s newborn star gleamed intensely through a disc of coalescing planetary matter. Chunks of rock and metal that had not yet formed into true worlds circled the primary, thick accretion disks of gas and dust surrounding the largest bits of rubble as gravity slowly formed them into planets and moons. The proto-planets were pregnant with common ores and many heavier elements, their mineral wealth awaiting collection. It was a mining consortium\u2019s dream.", "Alarms throbbed and Grace\u2019s head snapped up. Multiple targeting systems were lighting up Nemesis and Hekate \u2013 the dreadnaughts had emerged directly in a minefield! Sensor drones were locking onto both vessels, command platforms activating datalinks, missile pods coming on-line and energy mounts preparing to move on the intruders. There were a mixture of mines here \u2013 many were from the Compact and Principality, but some were recognizable as Red\u2019s own creations. Still others didn\u2019t match anything that Grace was familiar with. None of the weapons activated. They were Red One\u2019s defences and they quieted as the AI transmitted security protocols, allowing the ships to pass without incident.", "Allyria and Grace shared a look. The minefield was dense and it would not be the only one here. Even a fleet as large as Execution Force Renan would have taken heavy losses before fighting their way clear, but after that, the entire system was laid open. Both of them had been expecting something more... formidable for Red\u2019s base of operations. Before either of them could inquire, Echo spoke up.", "\u201cWhat,\u201d purred Red\u2019s sibling, moving around the holo plot. \u201cIs that?\u201d", "Grace blinked in surprise. Inside the minefield was a starship. It had been watching over the automatons and was coming out of stealth operations, shimmering into view as it shut down its cloak. On the tactical plot, its icon flashed, an enhanced image of the other vessel appearing in a subsection of the holo tank. Cruiser-sized, it was sleek and vicious with a bifurcated prow, slanted sides and heavy armour banding on its flanks. A dagger to Nemesis\u2019s broadsword and inescapably part of the same philosophy of design.", "\u201cThat,\u201d Red One replied with a sense of satisfaction, \u201cis UECNS Lahkesis, Fate-class strike cruiser.

It was coming closer, gliding through gas and dust clouds like a knife as it approached the newcomers, whispering to Nemesis in sign and counter-sign as it considered whether or not to attack, the signals between dreadnaught and cruiser so fast and dense that nothing less than an AI could have kept Lahkesis from firing. Accepting Red One\u2019s credentials, the smaller vessel banked away.", "Echo tittered a laugh.

The thought was both wonderful and horrifying. \u201cDo you have more?\u201d Grace asked, her stomach doing backflips. She wasn\u2019t the only one trying to adapt to this information. Lydia had lost a shade of colour, steadying herself against her console. She looked up at Grace, mouthing the word more?. Even Marcus\u2019s mask had cracked. It was what they\u2019d learned since childhood. Every lesson in school, every movie, every discussion, every historical document about the topic had hammered the point home. Artificial intelligence was anathema to organic life. The two could not coexist. Synthetics would, given the opportunity, wage war against every living soul in creation... and Red was raising an army.", "\u201cNone currently operational,\u201d Red One continued. \u201cAs resources become available, I use them as needed.

Optimistic projections indicate I will have a strike group-sized detachment within eighty-six years.\u201d", "Grace ran her tongue over her suddenly dry lips. \u201cYou attack every chance you get,\u201d she said, finally putting her theory into words, the thoughts she\u2019d been nurturing for weeks. \u201cYou attack until you are so damaged that you must stop. You do this over and over. They expect it. They believe that every moment you don\u2019t spend attacking is one spent preparing for the next one.

This one \u2013 what was left of it \u2013 squatted at the heart of a type of shipwomb Grace had never seen before, moving along monstrous rails like a spider along the strands of its web, a complicated network of grab beams and robotic manipulators, allowing it to build with horrifying speed... if it but had the resources to do so.", "There were only a handful of berths available; three were taken up by a trio of familiar-looking warships. The Furies Allecto, Megarea and Tisiphone. The most developed of them was less than a third complete. Another few slots were fitted with a quartet of civilian hulls. A pair of transports, a mining vessel and some type of corvette. The latter had a sigil splashed across its prow: a crimson gauntlet closed into a fist. Awaiting modification or slated for some other purpose? Grace wasn\u2019t sure, but it was the object that took up the latter half of the shipyard that truly held her attention, though. Calling it a skeleton would have been extremely generous, but there was enough of a basic superstructure to identify the beginnings of a hull and the interconnected shock systems. Not a cruiser like the Fates or the incomplete Furies, this was a titan-class vessel. The seed of another dreadnaught, another god-killer.", "Kali.", "She wouldn\u2019t live, not for a century or more but when she did... when she awoke, when her breach core surged to activation, when her weapons were charged, when her shields were raised and when she had a target in her sights... she would be her namesake: the end. Grace felt herself tremble, looking first to Red. The machine\u2019s avatar was standing straight, proud and hopeful. Determined. Echo was bracing herself against the railing, leaning as close to the image as she could, an expression of ecstasy and vindication on her all too human features. \u201c...beautiful,\u201d she whispered.", "\u201cHow long...\u201d Grace finally found her voice. \u201cHow long until... until she is... operational?\u201d", "Red One hesitated. \u201c...I don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted at last. \u201cHer weapons systems and technology will require an artificial intelligence to operate. Until and unless I can find a way to create a stable one, I cannot commit to full construction.\u201d", "The young woman nodded, winding her fingers through her hair. In all likelihood, she\u2019d never see Kali come on-line. She probably wouldn\u2019t even see the next group of strike vessels do so. Part of her, that small nagging voice that she\u2019d not yet been able to quell, whimpered in relief that she\u2019d never witness an armada of machines taking to the stars. The other part of her felt a keen disappointment in not being able to see such a thing. She felt a presence behind her. It was Allyria. The other girl leaned over Grace, resting her chin on her shoulder and clasping her arms. \u201cWe have a chance,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see? Hope.\u201d", "Grace reached up, touching her lover\u2019s hand. She nodded, looking around. Echo, Lydia, Marcus, Red. All of them survivors in their own way. All of them willing to fight. She felt a single tear roll down her cheek as she thought again of Rally and being able to see it as a free human, no longer Broken. Hope.

It was the latest Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment-class Chariot, freshly born from the Galhemna Shipwombs. Its first voyage had gone without incident and now it was on to the more mundane business of fleet trials, diagnostics and field tests. The Galhem-73 system was less than three light years from Galhemna itself and under the exclusive control of the Space Force. Once, 73 had belonged to the Justicars but all their holdings had been stripped from them once they had become Penitents. Currently, there was very little activity in the system \u2013 Weight of Destiny itself and a half dozen escorts and tugs, most of which were keeping well clear of the Chariot as its crew put it through its paces.", "Galhem-73 was a trinary system; 73-\u03b1 was a normal main sequence star. Its partner, 73-\u00df was a failure, a brown dwarf that had been torn from its orbit by 73-\u03b3. The third star of Galhem-73 was a neutron star, a rogue body that every sixty-three million years, came close enough to the rest of the system that its gravity altered orbits, shook fragile moons and asteroids apart and dragged interstellar effluvia with it to bombard the worlds further in-system. 73-\u03b3 was slowly but steadily destroying Galhem-73. Two terrestrial planets were now asteroid fields, shaken apart by tidal stresses. Other celestial bodies had been ripped from their normal orbits. It seemed like this incursion would be the last as 73-\u00df was even now being cannibalized by its dark cousin.", "It made the system useless for colonization, but exciting for scientific study and valuable as a proving ground.", "Column Leader Prime Culm (and seven names besides) stood upon the command dais as the Chariot dipped towards a particularly dense cluster of rocks and ice, there to practice its close-in maneuvers without undue risk of damage. Since the vessel\u2019s launch had gone well, it was on to the more mundane affairs of system checks and field tests before the ship would be officially christened and recognized as a Triarch\u2019s Chariot. Culm didn\u2019t expect there to be any major problems. He\u2019d served in the Galhem Fields for twenty years and the shipwrights here knew their business. Weight of Destiny was the first Chariot that Galhemna had received dispensation to build, but there were another two under construction. Once they were operational, they would become the backbone of Operation Sundial.", "\u201cPrime,\u201d Communications spoke up, interrupting the Column Leader Prime\u2019s reverie. \u201cWe are receiving a transmission. It\u2019s extremely faint. I am attempting to boost the signal now.\u201d She frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s a Priority One distress call, but I can\u2019t isolate any more than that at the moment.\u201d", "\u201cPlay what you have,\u201d Culm ordered and the submissive nodded. Static washed over the main viewscreen, white noise blanketing out almost all the speech. The Tribune could identify a syllable here and there, but nothing else. \u201cCodes are authentic?\u201d he asked.", "\u201cYes, patron. They are almost two years out of date, but they are confirmed. It is indicating a Tier Five situation.\u201d", "Culm scratched the underside of his chin. The Space Force was duty and honour-bound to respond to all distress signals. Priority One transmissions were sent only in the gravest of circumstances and... ice trailed down his spine to settle in his liver... and a Tier Five alert was beyond \u2018grave\u2019. Such a signal would normally only be sent from a vessel that had encountered a threat to the very Compact \u2013 potentially the entire galaxy \u2013 itself.", "\u201cAre we the closest vessel?\u201d he asked, receiving a curt nod from his Operations officer. \u201cThen we shall attend. End all training regimes immediately. Inform all departments to expect rescue operations and notify our escorts to move in to assist. Helm,\u201d he ordered, sliding his bulk into the throne. \u201cSet a course to the source of the signal.\u201d", "~", "The source of the transmission was, as Culm had expected, another ship. Somehow, it had come to Galhem-73 undetected. There had been no shockpoints in all the time Weight of Destiny had been here, so it may have arrived earlier. Possibly in search of aid, or through the vagaries of chance. Upon detection of another Compact sigil ship, the cripple had begun broadcasting. Weight of Destiny was trying to establish contact with the unknown, but there was no response. Only the distress call, repeating over and over. It was weak and more than once, the Chariot had lost the signal entirely, forced to spread its reconnaissance shell out wider and wider to reacquire the contact.", "They finally found it on the edge of the system, between 73-\u00df and 73-\u03b3, perilously close to the latter. 73- \u00df had been a hair\u2019s breadth from becoming a true star. It might even have become one were it not for 73-\u03b3\u2019s incursions, but now it was dying. On the last incursion, 73-\u03b3 had drawn 73-\u00df away from its twin and out to edge of the system. Even now, the neutron star was glowing with stolen stellar matter from 73-\u00df, a gleaming accretion disc surrounding the denser star as it glutted itself in an act of cannibalism. There was a small scientific outpost here \u2013 unmanned, for 73-\u00df\u2019s death throes were violent and unpredictable. Gravitational anomalies made this part of the system extremely hazardous for shocking. If the vessel had arrived here, then it would have crippled its own drive in the doing. There had been a small chance that it was the outpost itself that was responsible for the signal, but that was certainly not the case.", "\u201cTelemetry from River\u2019s Fury. We have visual imagery of the target,\u201d Operations reported. \u201cPutting it on the main viewer now.\u201d", "Culm rose from his throne as the picture resolved, a deeply unpleasant sensation winding through his guts. It was a Chariot, another Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment. It should have been a twin to Weight of Destiny, but it was badly damaged. It had been mauled, ripped and torn, the result of a savage assault battle, but against whom? Who could have done this to a Triarch\u2019s Chariot?", "\u201cPatron,\u201d Communications spoke up and her voice was flat. \u201cI\u2019ve managed to clean the signal further. The vessel\u2019s IFF is active.\u201d The submissive blinked all four eyes. \u201cIt identifies as the Redemption of Sol.\u201d", "\u201cThat is not possible,\u201d the ship\u2019s executive officer said aloud. \u201cThat vessel was lost around the Kaedan Vault. I heard-\u201d", "\u201cI know what everyone heard,\u201d Culm interrupted. \u201cBut it is here now and requires our aid. Put boarding teams on standby. Alert medical to expect incoming wounded. All decks are to ready themselves for recovery operations.\u201d He stared at the stricken Chariot. This felt wrong, but he could not ignore the vessel\u2019s distress. A Triarch had been aboard the vessel. It had had a crew of hundreds of thousands. If there was even the slightest chance that any of them were still alive...", "Something had happened to that ship. He needed to know what that was, even if it had not been his duty to do so. \u201cTake us in,\u201d he ordered. A beat. \u201cCarefully.\u201d", "Weight of Destiny\u2019s escorts clustered tighter to the Chariot as it moved towards the derelict. The closer they came, the more detail they could see on the Chariot. The Column Leader\u2019s skin crawled and his liver clenched at the sight of the vessel\u2019s mutilation. Someone or something had done this, despoiling the glory of the Compact\u2019s greatest vessels. Someone had been responsible for the deaths of thousands of loyal Compact soldiers and if that someone was also responsible for the death of a Triarch... there would be an accounting. He could only pray that it would be Weight of Destiny sent to settle that debt.", "There was still no answer to their hails. They would have to move quickly; the ship was being drawn towards 73-\u03b3. If it became caught in the neutron star\u2019s gravity well, the odds of recovery diminished greatly. He couldn\u2019t allow that; he would have his answers.", "Even at this range, the distress signal was still barely comprehensible, filled with static that washed out most of the sender\u2019s speech, but there was enough to ensure Culm\u2019s sense of unease was not mollified one iota.", "\u201c...sol... attack... assist... dead... damage... failure... crew...\u201d It repeated on a loop. There were some better visual images now, though \u2018better\u2019 was a relative term. There were indistinct shapes behind a wall of distortion. Impossible to identify.", "\u201cStill no response to our hails,\u201d Communications reported. \u201cUnable to clean the transmission further.

There should be something...\u201d", "\u201cScan data indicate fluctuations in the vessel\u2019s energy signature,\u201d Scopes put in. \u201cIt appears as if it\u2019s losing power.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re within three hundred thousand kilometers now. Wait one. Picking up... what is that?\u201d", "\u201cClarify,\u201d Culm demanded.", "\u201cDetecting some kind of vessel. It\u2019s small, some kind of courier. It was under stealth as we approached. Shockpoint forming! Patron, it\u2019s trying to jump!\u201d", "\u201cIt can\u2019t,\u201d Culm whispered as he leaned towards the displays. Not here, that was impossible-", "A shockpoint opened. It was unstable, but it did not collapse, not until the anomalous contact vanished through it. It should never have formed to begin with. How could anyone have found a stable enough libation point between the stars? Some type of courier... Culm felt something icy skewer his liver as those words played over in his mind. \u201cPower all defensive systems,\u201d he ordered. \u201cActivate the screens. Prepare for-\u201d", "He did not have the chance to finish as something slammed in-system, ripping its way into normal space between the stars. Like its herald, it should never have been able to survive such a jump. Perhaps it had damaged itself in the process, or perhaps it had not. Culm would never know.", "Smaller than either Chariot but still titan-sized, the newcomer emerged in horrific proximity to both Compact Chariots, cutting across Weight of Destiny\u2019s flank. It was a design Culm had never seen before, all hard angles, with a three-pronged prow like the jaws of a cahaba eel. He didn\u2019t recognize any of its heraldry. His escorts were already clawing madly to open distance between themselves and the intruder. Trailing flickering streamers, it was venting away the energy from its realspace emergence with shocking rapidity.", "Less than seven seconds after its arrival, the newcomer\u2019s screens snapped to life and active sensors locked onto Weight of Destiny. Triarchs, it was targeting them! Before the first warning klaxon had even finished, another pulsed as Redemption of Sol brought up its own weapons. The instability in its power systems vanished, a wall of static and jamming from the Chariot throwing Weight of Desinty\u2019s scopes back into its face.", "As Redemption of Sol came about, its mangled hull shimmered and faded as it dropped a holographic shell. No longer kin to Weight of Destiny, it had been re-painted, its brown hull now the colour of ash. The Compact heraldry had been obliterated, replaced with symbols that Culm didn\u2019t recognize, but they were much like the ones on the unknown. Its hull was different, too. Almost every window was gone, replaced by thick bands of armour and additional weapons mounts, the graceful slopes and curves of its elegant, predatory hull marred by harsh angles of baroque plating and unidentified weapons. The Chariot glowed softly under its own running lights, highlighting every difference and change in its design.", "In seconds, both vessels were ready to fire. It was a trap, and he\u2019d blundered right into it. Culm snapped out orders, but the most action Weight of Destiny had been expecting was combat drills. Stunned officers and ratings struggled to process the shocking turn of events, reacting as swiftly as they were able. Even if they were all hardened veterans, it still would take several moments to bring the Chariot to combat stations. An eternity.", "\u201cLeader!\u201d Communications spoke up. Her face was drawn. \u201cWe are receiving a transmission.\u201d", "\u201cFrom which ship?\u201d Culm demanded.", "\u201cBoth, patron.\u201d", "The Tribune nodded. \u201cBring it up.\u201d Maybe, just maybe...", "The signal played through Weight of Destiny\u2019s bridge. There was no visual component, only audio. Two female voices, so similar in affect that they could have been sisters, spoke in perfect unison.", "\u201cBurn with us.\u201d"]}

This was where Esseldon\u2019s rich and powerful had come to play, spending the money the planet\u2019s working class earned for them. Each of these ships cost more than miners earned in a lifetime and they were well stocked with expensive wines, rare objets d\u2019art and valuable prisoners. No more so than today, the opening of a regatta where each oligarch strove to outdo the others in wasteful extravagance. Today they\u2019d paid for all the blood on their hands with their own. And that was but the diversion, the appetizer she committed her most bloodthirsty troops to, while Lucas and her elites went about a different mission entirely.", "The woman grinned savagely as she beheld the fuel-slick, blood-choked waters, littered with the wreckage of ships and skimmers. Police cars burned as brightly as luxury vehicles, sinking military transports holed by the fusillade that had brought them down, caught off-guard by the pirates\u2019 firepower.", "She turned on her heel, stalking back to her gunship, Spite. In the distance, she\u2019d seen the specks of incoming attack craft. They\u2019d be on her position in minutes, pincering her against the armoured columns that were grinding through the city\u2019s panic-clogged streets. \u201cWe are leaving,\u201d she announced to her forces. \u201cUnless I miss my guess, my dear friend Rynzler is coming to say hello. Grab whatever you can carry, holster your guns, put your dicks back in your pants and get to the shuttles. If you fall behind, you can play with the demagogue.\u201d", "Spite lifted into the air in the instant her boots hit the deck, boosting into the atmosphere, several other landers already following her example. Already, ineffectual fire was beginning to track towards her pinnace, but the gunship was moving too fast for a visual solution and its countermeasures were keeping the Compact scopes from locking on.", "The pirate queen stalked into the cockpit. \u201cFind me the Janissary command frequency,\u201d she ordered, one of the crew handing her a headset as another played with Spite\u2019s command functions. She turned back to the personnel compartment, looking out the window. He wouldn\u2019t be with the airborne forces. Rynzlr loved to go in dirty. She focused on the armoured column instead. There; she spotted a command-variant Grinder, flanked by a pair of Blackened Feather anti-air tanks. Their gun barrels flashed as they fired ineffectively at Spite, hyper-velocity rounds ripping through the air around the gunship, but unable to hit the elusive craft.", "\u201cWe have the frequency,\u201d the ops officer reported.", "Adrianna grinned. \u201cCut me in.\u201d", "\u201c-that bitch!\u201d Rynzlr raged at his teams. \u201cOne of you target that Broken whore\u2019s craft and blow her out of the sky!

The last we tangled, you gave me this beautiful new gunship. I even named it in honour of you.\u201d She was baiting him, playing to those listening in. \u201cAre you sure you won\u2019t come off any worse the next time we dance?\u201d", "\u201cYou will die,\u201d Rynzlr said, very quietly, his voice quavering as he struggled to remain calm. \u201cI swear it. I will find you. I will hunt you to the ends of the universe, until the end of time itself. I will find you and I will cleave your skull from your head. It will sit on my desk as a warning to every other Unbound and Broken for this and the next hundred generations.\u201d", "She laughed then. \u201cNemesis rises,\u201d she mocked. The blasphemous insult was the final straw for the demagogue and he screamed and cursed his rage at her, long after she\u2019d closed the channel and her ship vanished into the heavens.", "Adrianna tried to struggle, to spit one last curse but the strength had ebbed out of her body and all she could do was stare at her enemy. Frothy blood bubbled up from her lips and Rynzlr laughed at her impotence, enjoying the fearful knowledge in her eyes. He was about to slit the Unbound\u2019s throat when he lifted his head, his attention drawn by a staccato hiss whispering through the air.", "His Janissaries heard it too and they raised their weapons. It was probably just the bunker\u2019s damaged air circulation system...", "Wait...", "Rynzlr\u2019s eyes narrowed as he saw a ghostly shimmer in the hall, the swish of stirred motes of dust. There was something there \u2013 he opened his mouth to shout a warning, but all that came out was a scream as that same something ripped through his chestplate, lifting him off the ground.", "Adrianna watched as the Tribune howled in agony, nearly half a ton of muscle and armour kicking uselessly against the air. Red-slick talons had torn through straight through his armour, hissing and sparking as the energy fields arcing over them cooked the Tribune\u2019s blood. More vital fluids gushed from the wound, spraying over his assailant. It was as tall as a Tribune in power armour, encased in a suit of its own. Adrianna watched as it pulled Rynzlr closer, the Tribune\u2019s legs flailing uselessly, his arms braced against his attacker as he tried to prevent himself from being further impaled. He failed, his hand slipping off its helmet and he sagged forward, face to face with his killer. \u201cI hate you,\u201d it whispered into his gaping, shocked visage before a powerful flick of its arm hurled the demagogue away to crash against the bulkhead.", "Fire tore at it; solid shot, slugs, flechettes and energy beams as the Janissary squad opened fire, but the killer was already moving, too fast to see, dancing through the barrage. It was among the Tribunes in an instant, its gleaming claws moving in blinding arcs that slashed through armour and flesh. Adrianna could only track it by the sounds of cutting. In seconds, there was only the hiss and pop of burning blood.", "She sagged her head against the floor; from here, she could see Rynzlr. The demagogue\u2019s eyes were wide and staring and he was gasping for breath as his life ebbed out of him. A shadow fell over Adrianna and she looked up into the dripping crimson visage of a killer. \u201cI heard you call,\u201d it said. In the distance, she could hear screams and the dull thuds and shrills of weapons fire. \u201cAnd I came.\u201d", "There was movement around her; others, coming to her aid. Hands dug into the rubble, digging the dying woman out. Adrianna took one last look at Rynzlr, the demagogue staring at her with all the hatred he could muster, still trying to climb to his feet. Somehow, before it all went black, she found the strength to laugh.", "~", "She woke up. There was blackness all around her and for an instant, panic seized her. She couldn\u2019t even move.", "\u201cYou\u2019re safe,\u201d a young woman\u2019s voice said from nowhere. She didn\u2019t recognize the speaker, but it wasn\u2019t a Tribune. In fact... it sounded human. \u201cI\u2019ve shut down your motor responses to prevent you from moving and inadvertently hurting yourself.\u201d", "Adrianna swallowed. \u201cI can\u2019t see.\u201d", "\u201cYou have a subdermal hematoma at the back of your skull,\u201d the unseen woman replied gently. \u201cThe blood pooled there while you were on the ground and it\u2019s putting pressure on your visual cortex.\u201d", "\u201cI can\u2019t feel my...\u201d Adrianna realized that she couldn\u2019t feel anything. \u201cAnything,\u201d she whispered.", "\u201cI\u2019ve administered a large dose of painkillers. The anesthetic is responsible for the numbing sensation. In actuality, you are in quite a lot of pain.\u201d", "\u201cWho are you? Where am I?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re safe,\u201d the girl assured her. \u201cThe Compact fleet attacking your outpost was destroyed. I recovered you from the rubble.\u201d A beat. \u201cThere were no other survivors. The Janissaries were under orders to terminate all personnel.\u201d Another pause. \u201cI am sorry.\u201d", "\u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my questions,\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cWho are you? Where am I?\u201d", "There was a longer pause. \u201cThe answer to those questions are one and the same,\u201d the voice said at last. \u201cI am the United Earth Confederacy Naval Ship Nemesis and you are currently aboard my primary medical bay. You called me,\u201d the ship said. \u201cAnd I answered.\u201d", "Adrianna laughed, the manic sound fuelled by disbelief at the claim and the terror of her helplessness. \u201cYou... no, you\u2019re not real,\u201d she asserted. \u201cThe Nemesis was destroyed two thousand years ago by Bringer of Light. I saw the records. You\u2019re lying. You\u2019re lying.\u201d", "\u201cIt was actually the other way around,\u201d the girl said, her voice hardening. \u201cBut we can argue the facts of my existence later. I brought you out of this medically-induced coma for a reason. You are dying. The damage to your body is extreme. Multiple organ failures, severe internal bleeding, extensive nerve damage. I have four options, but I need your consent before beginning any medical procedures.\u201d", "Her lips felt dry. She wanted to lick them, but her body was so numb that she didn\u2019t know if she could. \u201cWhat-\u201c she fought back the quaver in her voice. \u201cWhat options?\u201d", "\u201cThe first is simple: you reject my assistance. You will die within the hour. I will continue to administer an anesthetic drip to prevent you from feeling pain. If requested, I can also euthanize you.\u201d The matter of fact way the speaker \u2013 Adrianna wasn\u2019t yet prepared to admit that she was talking to an artificial intelligence \u2013 said it made her skin crawl, but the young woman continued. \u201cYour second option is that I stabilize you, but do nothing else. You will permanently lose the use of your legs and will require several organ transplants.\u201d", "\u201cSure. You\u2019ve got a bunch of surgeons in the next room.\u201d", "\u201cNo. I have a surgical suite that has more anatomical knowledge and greater skill than any organic doctor.\u201d", "If her lips had felt dry previously, this mad her mouth a desert. The thought of a machine \u2013 or a lunatic who thought she was a machine \u2013 cutting her open... it was... no, this was impossible. All of this was impossible. It had to be. But there it was: the smallest, tiniest bit of hope that compelled her to silence her tirade of denials and ask, in a very small voice: \u201cWhat else?\u201d", "\u201cOption three: Life-saving treatment, coupled with improved regenerative protocols. This will restore you to near-full functionality, but it will require physical therapy and considerable recuperation. Your physiology is likely to reject most regeneration treatments, so this will be very time-consuming.\u201d There was another pause. \u201cYou have a fourth option.\u201d", "\u201cSo you\u2019ve said. What is it?\u201d", "The voice told her.", "~", "\u201cThirty kilometers per hour,\u201d Red One announced.", "Adrianna smiled a little at that. She\u2019d always kept herself in good shape, but even on her best day, she\u2019d never been able to run this fast, or for this long. Her legs were almost a blur as she ran on the treadmill, watching the odometer tick upwards at a literally inhuman rate. She was sweating, her clothes stained through and through and her heart was pounding, but less than some of her previous workouts. Her smile widened. She was running faster than any human ever had \u2013 faster than some vehicles and she was only a little winded.", "This had been Red One\u2019s fourth option: to rebuild her. She wasn\u2019t a machine \u2013 she was still very much flesh and blood. There was just less of it. Her bones had been reinforced with carbon fibers. Her muscles were enhanced with synthetic cords, her respiratory system was more efficient, her reaction times were far faster, her senses keener. Humanity 2.0. There was circuitry \u2013 if you could even call it that \u2013 in her brain, biotechnic systems within her body and sensor bafflers that would provide false readings to active scanners. Weaker passive scans wouldn\u2019t even see anything different about her. Just another \u2018Broken\u2019.", "Her grin widened.", "She\u2019d been rebuilt from the ground up. Abomination. That was what the Compact would call her. The Askanj wouldn\u2019t have such provocative rhetoric, but they\u2019d still kill her on sight, just for existing. There was a perverse part of her that enjoyed that.", "\u201cThat will be enough for today,\u201d Red One informed the woman.", "Adrianna began slowing down. The ship had told her not to push herself too hard, but it was tempting to see what she could really do. She needed time to adjust, though. Her limbs ached all the time and her immune system was fighting the cybernetics. If she pushed herself too hard before her treatment was finished and the implants became fully integrated, she\u2019d reduce their effectiveness, or cause an auto-immune disease that would lead to wholesale rejection. Just as well she hadn\u2019t chosen option three; Red One\u2019s initial assessment had been optimistic and her body would have rejected the regeneration therapy entirely.", "She still didn\u2019t quite know why she\u2019d accepted this ludicrous, insane, terrifying idea. To be taken apart by someone she couldn\u2019t even see and put back together only with fewer fleshy bits. Part of her had quailed at the thought, wondering if this was some kind of sick sadistic joke of Rynzler\u2019s. What had convinced her was the \u2018girl\u2019s\u2019 simple, evocative plea: \u201cYou called to me. Let me help you.\u201d", "Adrianna had, but she\u2019d never meant to. She\u2019d been quite sincere in her belief when she\u2019d said that Nemesis was dead. All the records she\u2019d hacked into had been quite clear on that. Humanity\u2019s ultimate weapon had been a dismal failure.", "Still, the thought of it had inspired her. Every kill her Red Hand had made had been marked with old human battle-cant and warnings that Nemesis had returned. It had been supposed to be inspiring, to remind her \u2018soldiers\u2019 of what they could do and to inspire the population. The latter hadn\u2019t worked, but her subordinates had begun thinking of themselves as something more than smugglers and pirates... and then the Compact had found them. Two-thirds of her forces gone, just like that. Her most loyal and dedicated personnel were dead and every gain she\u2019d ever made was wiped away. She had nothing left.", "I had nothing once. I made an empire.", "The woman\u2019s lips twisted in a snarl. She\u2019d do what she always did when she had nothing. She\u2019d take what she wanted. She came to the Cursed Red Gauntlets with nothing but the clothes on her back and she\u2019d worked her way up to stand at Vuld\u2019s side. The clan\u2019s \u2018king\u2019 been a creature of sadism, of brutality and disgusting appetites, but he had been powerful, commanding one of the larger Unbound forces and he had always needed competent submissives. It had amused him to see skill in the Broken girl, testing and testing her to see when she would fail.", "She hadn\u2019t.", "The guards burst into the room, weapons raised. She turned to meet them, one hand still clutching the knife that had opened Vuld\u2019s chest. Her other arm was smeared almost to the shoulder with Tribune blood, her fingers clenched around something wet and dripping. Her skin was coated in sweat, stringing beads of it falling from her bangs into her eyes, each painful breath catching in her chest. She had several broken ribs and one lung was in danger of being punctured by the shards of bone splintered in her chest, but she would not show weakness. Not now. \u201cOur leader met with an accident,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore he died, he named me to replace him.\u201d", "They stared at her, these mercenaries and murderers, killers from a half-dozen species gaped at the slightly-built human, looking at the blood that soaked her form, her blue hair dripping with it. At the open, still-bleeding wounds that criss-crossed her flesh, bodysuit and skin both torn. At the body of their former leader, the gash that had been ripped in his chest, where something had been torn from his body. She watched them in return, daring them to challenge her. Vuld had been many things, but he had also been a supremely proficient killer. A human should not have been able to best him.", "They knelt. \u201cHail,\u201d the first of them said. \u201cHail to the queen of the Cursed Red Gaunlets.\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d Adrianna said, lifting her bloodied hand, letting the hewn pieces of Vuld\u2019s heart drop to the floor. Her dark eyes glittered, a thin smile coming to her lips. \u201cWe won\u2019t be called that any longer.\u201d", "\u201cThe Red Hand,\u201d another mercenary whispered.", "The human woman looked at him for a long moment and then nodded. \u201cThe Red Hand.\u201d", "She\u2019d taken what she wanted then, and she\u2019d do so now.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to stop,\u201d Adrianna hissed abruptly, sweat dripping down into her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to go back to the Red Hand and take what\u2019s mine. I\u2019m going to kill anyone who thinks that they can replace me. I\u2019m going to rebuild and I\u2019m going to keep reaving. I\u2019m going to burn worlds, splinter ships. Anyone who gets in my way will die,\u201d she declared hoarsely. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep making them pay.\u201d", "Her saviour said nothing to this and Adrianna raised her head, baring her teeth in a feral smile. \u201cThe killing will never stop.\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d agreed Nemesis. \u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201d"]}

None of them were the originals, but the work was good \u2013 there was no indication that each tooth had been broken at least once. \u201cAre you that loyal to a corpse?\u201d the Tribune asked with feigned incredulity, but Harker could see the anger boiling behind the Tribune\u2019s upper eyes. His lower, larger daylight eyes were impossible to read, not since they had been ritually blinded upon his exile.", "\u201cWe don\u2019t know that she\u2019s dead,\u201d Lucas retorted.", "Yndol laughed again, an edge of mania to the sound. He had never been terribly balanced, following Leblanc less because he believed in her ideals than because she allowed him to indulge his unwholesome desires. He\u2019d been \u2013 he was, Lucas corrected himself \u2013 her attack dog. Content to follow at his mistress\u2019s heels when there was blood and plunder, but one to be watched. The commander had left Lucas to do just that while she oversaw the completion of their new base. Ever since the news had come in, Yndol had been harder to control. The dog wanted off the leash.", "Lucas had played for time, but he had few allies here. Most of the surviving Red Hands were old guard, pirates and marauders who\u2019d been impressed by \u2018azea haal\u2019s\u2019 coup. Like Yndol, they cared not one whit about the cause. Their loyalty was measured in the money they\u2019d earned under her, the opportunities for slaughter she\u2019d given them and \u2013 though they\u2019d never admit to it \u2013 the fear they\u2019d had of the Broken who\u2019d taken the Cursed Red Gauntlets and turned them into something greater. With Leblanc missing and presumed dead, there was too little of that to matter. Just as Yndol, they didn\u2019t see the need to bow their heads to a memory and certainly not the memory of a mere human. The man ground his teeth. Only a few weeks earlier, they would have never dared say that out loud.", "\u201cEveryone else who followed her is,\u201d the Tribune said. \u201cChattel butchered by the Compact. Led to that slaughter by our dear leader, the \u2018blue fire\u2019.\u201d Yndol chucked, the ugly sound coming from deep within his broad chest. \u201cNot burning so brightly now, is she?\u201d", "Lucas ground his teeth. \u201cUntil we have confirmation of her death, you are still Red Hand.\u201d It was a poor argument, but it was all he had. He wasn\u2019t the orator that Leblanc had been \u2013 was.", "\u201cA name,\u201d Yndol grunted. \u201cWithout azea haal, it is merely words with no significance.\u201d He grinned wider. \u201cAnother name.\u201d The Tribune\u2019s black tongue slid over his gleaming teeth. \u201cThe fire has gone out, yes?\u201d", "\u201cIt will never go out,\u201d Lucas snapped, harsher than he\u2019d meant to.", "\u201cIt already has,\u201d the pirate said, reaching down to a put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cAnd I think, for the better.

Lucas\u2019s fingers bled as he cut himself on the alien\u2019s denticles \u2013 it was like clawing at a shark that had you in its mouth. Slowly, ever so slowly, Yndol tightened his grip. \u201cAnd we all know how to quench a fire,\u201d the Tribune explained helpfully as Lucas\u2019s vision dimmed. \u201cYou starve it of air.\u201d", "Lucas gagged, struggling to breathe, but Yndol\u2019s grip was like iron. Somehow over the sound of blood rushing in his ears, he heard music. Harker drooled a laugh as he recognized the melody. He was dying. He had to be, because he was hearing... Yndol frowned, his ears twitching and he relaxed his chokehold a fraction, looking into the upper recesses of the amphitheater. Someone up there was a whistling, a tune he\u2019d heard before. \u201cWho is doing that?\u201d Yndol snarled. \u201cWhich of you whoresons thinks they are funny?\u201d", "A silhouette moved.\u201cPut him down.\u201d", "Yndol smiled, looking back at his captive. \u201cA human,\u201d he drawled. \u201cAnother of your kind. You are like maggots; never seen but when you are, you writhe and squirm over each other in numbers. In our queen\u2019s fleet, it seemed that you could not take a step without a human\u2019s stench filling your nostrils. Alas, it still appears to be this way.\u201d He turned back to the speaker. \u201cWho are you to give a Tribune orders, Broken?\u201d", "\u201cI am your queen,\u201d the now very-familiar voice said. Yndol blinked in astonishment as the speaker strode down the steps of the amphitheater, past each of the gawping Unbound. \u201cI am the human who killed Vuld and cut his heart out.\u201d A Broken female, with long blue hair hanging almost to her waist. She was clad in a stippled bodysuit, a cut-down blaster on her right thigh and a knife on her left. \u201cI am the \u2018blue fire\u2019. I am the Red Hand and I have returned.\u201d Many of those in the audience were looking away, some shrunk down in their chairs and a handful of others watched with obvious anticipation. \u201cAnd I just gave you an order,\u201d Leblanc said, her voice cold.", "Yndol glanced at Lucas as if remembering that the other human was still there. The Tribune opened his fist, letting the smaller man drop to the floor. Harker gasped for air, unable to rise to his feet. The Tribune laughed. It was low, it was rough and it was not quite sane. \u201cYou died,\u201d was all he said.", "\u201cAnd yet, here I am.\u201d", "\u201cYou died,\u201d the Tribune repeated, soft and dangerous. \u201cEveryone who went with you burned. You died.\u201d", "She smiled. It was thin, like light glinting off a knife. \u201cThe fire rises, Yndol. Don\u2019t you know this?\u201d", "He took a step towards her. \u201cEveryone who went with you is dead. That means you\u2019re alone.\u201d", "The human\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cBut I am here. Back on your leash, dog.\u201d", "The Tribune laughed. The sound was ugly and raw. He laughed and then lunged, seven hundred pounds of muscle moving in a blur-", "-she met his charge, a flash of colour-", "-and time stopped. Or it seemed to. Yndol froze in his charge, his face twisted in astonishment. Leblanc had driven her hand into his chest. Bright red blood was already oozing out of the wound, pouring down her arm. The Tribune\u2019s expression was more confused than pained. \u201cWhat...\u201d he said, loosing a howl as Leblanc pulled her hand free, a gout of red splashing to the floor. The Tribune fell to his knees, putting a hand to his chest as he tried to stem the flow of blood. \u201cKill her...\u201d he rasped, his face contorted as shock gave way to agony. \u201cKill her!\u201d", "Someone tried. Lucas never saw who. All he heard was the crack of a pistol and the accompanying flash of light in the dimly-lit room. He heard something like a sack of flour topple and roll down the steps of the amphitheater. Adrianna was still standing, her pistol held in her clean hand. She scanned it across the rows of pirates, the targeting laser drifting across forehead after forehead. \u201cOn. Your. Knees,\u201d the queen of the Red Hand snarled.", "These men and women, these murderers and rapists, smugglers and pirates, stared back at the tiny human. They were not the idealists who had burned with her \u2013 they were most mercenary of her band, the ones who hadn\u2019t yet been trusted to accompany her to Unicorn Set. They held no loyalty to any cause but themselves and they only followed the strongest. These dregs looked to the gasping form of Yndol, the headless body of their comrade and slight form of their queen, who had come among them alone... they were very conscious of their own weapons...", "...and they knelt.", "Adrianna made a noise much like a purr. She turned back to Yndol. \u201cYou see?\u201d she told him. \u201cThe fire rises.\u201d", "The Tribune spat blood at her.", "She sighed. \u201cOh, Yndol. You could have been so much more. You could have been glorious. The Red Hand will be reborn. We have so much more to do. You could have been a part of it. My hound, my attack dog. You could have had your fill of blood and treasure, everything you\u2019d ever wanted. Why wouldn\u2019t you let me make you magnificent? Just once more?\u201d", "He cursed at her. \u201cYou are Broken,\u201d the Tribune gargled, blood seeping over his lips. \u201cYour race is pitiful and small and you... you are poisoned. You will kill us all.\u201d", "\u201cEveryone dies,\u201d Adrianna raised her pistol, pointing it at his temple. \u201cAll that matters is whether we\u2019re on our feet or our knees.\u201d", "The Tribune opened his mouth for a final exhortation of defiance, but whatever he was going to say ended when Leblanc pulled the trigger, vapourizing the upper portion of his skull. Yndol\u2019s corpse thudded to the floor, the stench of burning Tribune meat filling the air.", "Leblanc held out a hand to Lucas, pulling him to his feet. She squeezed his shoulder, the only expression of compassion she would make in front of the rest of her followers. Adrianna turned back to the other pirates. \u201cI am aware,\u201d she drawled. \u201cThat there has been some question about leadership in past days. Let me say I welcome an open and transparent examination of our operations,\u201d her eyes hardened. \u201cI am just as eager as you to discuss with each of you the loss of so many of other brothers and sisters in arms at Unicorn Set.\u201d She strode out of the amphitheater, Harker following her. She paused at the top of the stairs. \u201cOh...\u201d she said, as if a passing thought had just struck her. \u201cSomeone clean up the mess.\u201d", "~", "Engineering was lost. The boat bays were in enemy hands and on every channel, all Idelogue Saban (and four names besides) could hear was dying. The invaders were insane, a boiling tide of filth that simply overran every position, heedless of the cost. He had never heard of Unbound who fought this way \u2013 they were carrion-eaters and scavengers, preying on the weak. Unwavering Strike was a heavy cruiser, fresh from the Odegon wombs and it had more firepower than entire Unbound clans. The vermin should have been cowering in their holes the instant this ship shocked in-system. Instead, they had the audacity \u2013 the gall \u2013 to attack a vessel of the Compact armada.", "What\u2019s more, they were winning. It was unthinkable. Impossible.", "Saban listened as someone screamed, the cry ending before it reached full pitch. He\u2019d ordered his remaining units to monitor only essential communications. They didn\u2019t need to hear this. Saban had lost communication with demagogue Tyrdon shortly after he\u2019d launched a counter-attack to retake engineering and Saban assumed his superior was dead.", "He cycled through the channels, listening for any hint of good news, but all he could hear was desperate last stands, calls for aid and that damnable chanting. It was like the pounding of a drum, clicking Broken words turned into a hateful cadence. One of the bridge officers studied dead languages; she\u2019d told Saban that it was a human dialect. It meant \u2018the fire rises\u2019.", "Saban knew what that meant. It was the war-cant of the Red Hand. They only chanted it when their leader took to the field. The bitch herself, the so-called azea haal was on his ship. The Janissary ground his teeth in righteous hatred. The Cursed Red Gauntlets had once been one of a thousand equally pathetic raider clans, clinging to life like parasites on the body of the Compact. Until her, until some wretched Broken had changed them into the Red Hand.", "The Janissary tapped his forefinger against his carbine\u2019s trigger guard. He wanted to move, to stalk, to hunt and kill the vermin that were infesting Unwavering Strike, but his duty was to protect the command deck... as long as the bridge held, there was still a chance that the ship could be re-taken. Saban frowned suddenly, switching channels. One of the forward defence posts had gone dark. The datafeeds from that section were down, so the ideologue used his command override to patch into ideologue, submissive Vansk\u2019s helmet display. Her scopes were offline, but her helmet cam was still running, staring at the submissive\u2019s own beheaded form. Her legs were still twitching, spastic impulses from a failing nervous system.", "Silhouettes, grotesque and stunted parodies of a Tribune\u2019s form, filtered past as Vansk\u2019s killers picked their way through the gore of the murdered Janissary squad. They made no sound as they did so, but all Saban would have to do was switch to an open frequency to hear that damnable chanting.", "They were coming.", "\u201cContact,\u201d the squad\u2019s scope specialist announced. Telemetry from her vambrace augur appeared on Saban\u2019s HUD. Three point sources were moving towards Saban and his last line of defence. A probe or suicide attack. The ideologue gestured and his soldiers took up firing positions, moving into what little cover the corridor provided. They\u2019d erected barricades and a single crew-served weapon. Enough firepower to stall even the most dedicated berserker charge.", "One of the contacts halted in its advance, disappearing from the motion tracker. Saban\u2019s eyes narrowed. A casualty... those weren\u2019t hostile raiders \u2013 they were fleeing allies! \u201cReady weapons,\u201d he said, bracing himself into a firing position, raising his carbine. \u201cFire on my order only. We may be seeing friendlies.\u201d", "A second contact faded from scopes. Only one left and it was moving , desperation lending it speed. Saban watched as a security officer ran into view, skidding around the corner. His armour was cracked and burnt, charred lacerations cut into his cuirass. He fell to his knees, scrambling to his feet. He looked up, his face drawn in terror behind his cracked faceplate. \u201cHelp me!\u201d The man shouted. \u201cHelp-\u201d He turned, something catching his eye. \u201cNo! No, get back!\u201d he screamed, drawing his sidearm and firing wildly at a target Saban couldn\u2019t see. A form leapt into view, small and lithe. Something crackled in its hands, a sapphire blur. The proctor shrieked, the cry ending mid-pitch as he was impaled on the deck. The figure wrenched the blade free, looking towards Saban. It was small, like a malnourished child, clad in a thin bodysuit and only lightly armoured. Red lenses were set into its faceless helm, giving it an insectile appearance. In one hand, it carried a brutal-looking khopesh, the dark blade crackling and sparking with a disruption field. In its other hand it carried an unidentifiable pistol.", "None of that concerned him as much as the mane of blue hair that had spilled out of the back its helm, the ends burnt short. It was her. It was her. It was the human, the Red Hands\u2019 bitch-queen. The glance Saban and Leblanc shared hadn\u2019t lasted even a second before the Tribune roared. \u201cOpen fire!\u201d", "She moved \u2013 Triarchs, she was fast, faster than Saban believed possible \u2013 dancing and writhing through the fusillade she avoided the worst of it, but the corridor wasn\u2019t wide enough to dodge every single shot. Still, she almost reached them. Rounds struck her in the chest, arms, legs and face and Saban saw her fall. \u201cCease!\u201d he shouted. He wanted there to be enough left of her to identify. He had served under demagogue Rynzlr \u2013 if there was enough left of the Broken, he was going to honour man\u2019s memory with the sow\u2019s head or perhaps just her scalp. He looked over at convert Jadu. \u201cConfirm the kill.\u201d", "Jadu nodded. He strode forward, his rifle held in his hands, watching the Broken. There was a hazy shimmer around her body and the Tribune blinked. That looked like a-", "She was on her feet an instant later, spinning inside Jadu\u2019s guard, her balesword shrieking as it cut through his armour. \u201cNot that easy,\u201d she hissed to the Janissary as he died on her blade. She swung her pistol under his limp arm and fired. Another soldier died and the squad opened up again, their barrage hitting their own man. She vaulted over the shuddering corpse and launched herself down the hallway, landing amidst them. The first stroke of her sword cut the barrel from the heavy assault cannon. Her next shot ended a third soldier\u2019s life. She spun through the Tribune ranks, licking out with blade and pistol, always moving, avoiding the worst of their attacks. Combat drugs shrilled in her veins, inuring her to her own pain as she shot and slashed her way through the horde of soldiers.", "Cut. An arm ended at the elbow. Cut. A leg was opened to the bone. Cut. A throat was slashed. Cut. Cut. Cut.", "The dance ended, her partners lying at her feet.", "Her squad arrived moments later, several of them freezing for an instant as they beheld their queen. She stood amongst the dead, panting. Several ribs were broken. Her was suit torn, blood and inorganic fluids leaked from her wounds. The broken tip of a Janissary\u2019s gladius was lodged in her side, patches of her skin were burnt from the close-range discharge of energy weapons, liquefied meat and pus oozing over her bodysuit. Self-repair mechanisms were already at work, the machine in her repairing itself, regenerating her grievous words. Coated in gore, flush with adrenalin and the euphoria of the combat drugs, she was grinning.", "Adrianna pulled her torn faceplate off, raising a shaking arm and pointing to the door to the heavy cruiser\u2019s command deck. \u201cOpen it.\u201d", "Her soldiers hurried to obey, very few daring to look their blood-drenched queen in the eyes.", "\u201cYou outpaced us,\u201d Lucas admonished. He kept his eyes averted from the exposed cybernetic parts of her body, like a bashful suitor catching his dearest naked. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d", "\u201cI know,\u201d Leblanc admitted. He was right; she was more than she\u2019d ever been, but she was still only one woman. Her new abilities could only protect her so much. Her personal shield had been overtaxed; it had nearly failed and if it did, it was effectively useless for the rest of the battle. Status markers and warning icons were blinking in her field of vision; she banished them with a single mental command. She\u2019d made a calculated risk in leading this charge. She was still rebuilding the Red Hand \u2013 she needed a victory to inspire the people she had left and draw new ones to her banner. Not a simple raid or plundering of a helpless colony. Something like the capture of a Compact heavy cruiser. The Unbound only respected strength and so she would be strong. She\u2019d be more than the Red Queen \u2013 she\u2019d be \u2018azea haal\u2019, that name she hated.", "The shuttle settled itself in Nemesis\u2019s primary hangar, a perfect landing. As the armoured doors of the bay closed, Adrianna could just barely see the form of the freighter Hope\u2019s Well. It wasn\u2019t the most extravagant ride she\u2019d ever had, but it would do. As the doors closed and the atmosphere flooded back into the bay, the young woman picked up her duffel bag and trotted towards the waiting shuttle. It was a boxy, utilitarian affair, one of countless millions across the galaxy. There was no pilot. For that matter, there was no crew aboard the freighter waiting for her. Not anymore.", "\u201cI have pre-programmed a single warp into the freighter\u2019s mainframe,\u201d Red One reminded Leblanc. \u201cIt will take you to Namadine Prek.\u201d", "The young woman nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll see what my loyal submissives have been getting up to.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI think I might have to kill at least one of them.\u201d", "The ship did not have a reply for that. \u201cBe careful,\u201d she said instead. \u201cMy modifications have improved your abilities substantially, but they do not make you immortal.\u201d", "\u201cI know,\u201d Adrianna replied. She\u2019d been given much, but there was a price. In addition to all her improvements, Red One had installed a security measure \u2013 a self-destruct charge that would remove any trace of Leblanc\u2019s implants. If she were ever killed or captured, the Compact would never know the true nature of her upgrades. Adrianna could set it off at will, if she chose. \u201cI\u2019ll be careful. Well,\u201d she amended. \u201cMore careful.\u201d", "\u201cPlease do,\u201d Red One hesitated a moment. \u201cI know you want to focus your efforts on Rally,\u201d she said. This wasn\u2019t the first time she and Adrianna had had this argument. Leblanc had, at last, come around to the ship\u2019s rationale. Though the Compact was extremely watchful of the humans, it treated them with a slightly lighter touch than it did many other client races. It did this because less out of magnanimity than out of concern that harsh treatment might spur Nemesis to correspondingly harsh actions. If, however, Adrianna focussed her attentions on Rally, the Compact would respond \u2013 and likely not in moderation. Though the truth of humanity\u2019s history was lost, even to many in the Compact itself, enough of them remembered the Confederacy\u2019s \u2018crimes\u2019. They would never let such things happen again. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d", "Adrianna\u2019s head came up and her eyes flashed. It had been a frequent argument, but it was the one she resented losing the most. \u201cI know,\u201d she said, more harshly than she liked. \u201cI know,\u201d she repeated, moderating her tone. Her gaze dropped to the deck. \u201cI know. I... don\u2019t want to,\u201d she admitted. \u201cWhen I was little, I used to look around at all the other boys and girls in my neighbourhood, how happy they were. I wasn\u2019t. I kept asking myself what was wrong with me. I saw the same question in my parent\u2019s eyes after every altercation. I saw it in the confessors\u2019 and counsellors\u2019 eyes when I was lectured on how to behave. I heard exasperated teachers ask it of me. It was even the last thing Commissioner Sath said when I killed him. \u2018What is wrong with you?\u2019. Every day of my life I\u2019ve had that question in my head. Why couldn\u2019t I fit in. Why couldn\u2019t I be like everyone else?\u201d Wetness pooled in the corners of her eyes. \u201cI pushed it all away, so far down that I wouldn\u2019t have to think about it. But it\u2019s not me, is it? It\u2019s them. It\u2019s been a thousand years of social engineering, propaganda and eugenics that did this to them.\u201d She looked up, a tear curling down her cheeks. Her expression, for once, lacked the shields of manufactured sadism, mercurial bravado and every other aspect she donned in her \u2018Red Queen\u2019 persona.\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave them.\u201d", "\u201cYou have to,\u201d Red One told her. \u201cThe Compact will never stop hunting you. If you try to hold onto Rally, the Compact will only tighten their grip on the world. It will give them every excuse they need to justify their excesses. I won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d", "Adrianna nodded, picking her duffel bag back up. She trudged towards the waiting shuttle, then paused just before the ramp. \u201cDo we have a chance?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo we have a chance at all?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the ancient machine said after a moment. \u201cMore of one before we met. It\u2019s still not much. I haven\u2019t hoped for a very long time. All I know is vengeance.\u201d", "The pirate nodded, her mask of theatrical brutality back in place. \u201cThe killing will never stop.\u201d She climbed into the shuttle, Red One taking it back to the Hope\u2019s Well. The woman who played at being a queen looked out the window at the dwindling shape of UECNS Nemesis. It was the last time she ever saw the ship.", "Adrianna looked at her people. They were scared of her, in awe of her. That was what she needed. To prove to the old guard and the new that she was their queen, their ruler and they could follow her or be destroyed. None of them, not even Lucas, knew the truth about her resurrection. Those she trusted at all were told of a secret pact she\u2019d made with a cabal of outlawed scientists, that they had recovered her barely-breathing form and fulfilled their end of a devil\u2019s bargain. The others? Let them wonder.", "They said she had always been this way \u2013 that was how she had bested Vuld. That she was a clone and the original had died back in the ambush, that if she fell another would simply take her place. That she had been infected by some ancient artefact and it had repaired her. That that same artefact was consuming her flesh bit by bit. That she had been a Compact cyborg experiment that had gone rogue. The theories and rumours piled higher every day and she encouraged them all.", "Yes, her people... they would follow her to the gates of Hell and back out of loyalty, avarice or outright fear, but fear of her \u2018benefactor\u2019 would eclipse that. So she let them believe as they wanted. All that really mattered was that she was the woman that the Compact couldn\u2019t kill; that she had defied them and lived. They tried to execute her; she escaped. They\u2019d try to burn her; she came back.", "I wonder what they\u2019ll do for the third time?", "Adrianna\u2019s demolitions expert gestured, catching her attention. \u201cReady.\u201d", "The pirate queen drew her pistol, checking its charge. She pulled her damaged helm back into place, smiling beneath it as she donned her bloody persona once again. \u201cThis is our ship now,\u201d she told them. \u201cLet\u2019s finish the cleanup.\u201d", "~", "Enmet\u2019ej, lord of the Memetic Virus, laced his long fingers in his lap as he considered the image gleaming above his desk. \u201cForty thousand,\u201d he said. \u201cNo more.\u201d", "\u201cEighty,\u201d the small scrap of nothing piped in its annoyingly high-pitched voice. \u201cNo less.\u201d", "\u201cUnacceptable,\u201d Enmet\u2019ej said testily. \u201cI would have no profit left. Forty.\u201d", "\u201cA load like this sells for at least one hundred twenty,\u201d the female countered. \u201cYou\u2019ll still make plenty of money. I have expenses too.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Enemet\u2019ej said, tapping his forefingers against one another. \u201cI have heard. The fire rises.\u201d A thin smile formed on his lipless mouth. \u201cAs do your fortunes.\u201d", "\u201cAnd my operating costs.\u201d", "\u201cI have heard that too,\u201d the Thoughtful replied. \u201cI consider it a mark of hubris to bandy your prize about so wantonly. I would say human hubris, but your species has little to be proud of.\u201d", "Adrianna smiled. \u201cShould I be insulted at the dismissal of my race or flattered that my capture of Unwavering Strike is considered something worthy of pride?\u201d", "\u201cAs you like,\u201d Enmet\u2019ej answered. \u201cLesser species, I find, will put their own interpretations on obvious facts regardless of how simply they are presented.\u201d", "\u201cYou are trying to make me angry,\u201d the human countered. \u201cI think you\u2019re trying to get this member of a primitive species so worked up she forgets how to negotiate properly. Hasn\u2019t that ever bitten you on the ass?\u201d", "The Thoughtful\u2019s eyelids blinked asynchronously as he processed the idiom. \u201cIf I take your meaning properly... no. More emotional individuals have reacted with haste \u2013 often cancelling negotiations, only to find that I am the only one able to deal with their products. Then they must return to me and accept weaker terms than before. Those who respond with hostility often do not complete their negotiations at all.\u201d", "\u201cAnd then you use their lack of tact and their decision to threaten you to extort better terms from their crew,\u201d the Broken clicked her tongue. \u201cRisky and situational. Eighty.\u201d", "\u201cFifty. My operating costs have gone up as yours have.\u201d", "\u201cSeventy-five. Your costs aren\u2019t my problem.\u201d", "\u201cThey are when you create them. Your actions have brought the Compact\u2019s wrath down across this entire expanse. Networks have been torn up, operators have been killed or imprisoned \u2013 the remaining assets have raised their fees accordingly. Non-cartel contacts have gone silent or substantially increased asking prices for their services. You would know this if you cared to lower yourself to such acts as smuggling as the Cursed Red Gauntlets once did. Fifty-five.\u201d", "\u201cWe still smuggle.\u201d", "Enmet\u2019ej sniffed disdainfully. \u201cYou smuggle weapons to pathetic insurrectionist groups.\u201d", "\u201cI believe you\u2019re trying to goad me again. The Red Hand-\u201d", "\u201c-is truly Unbound,\u201d the Thoughtful sneered. \u201cThe cartels, we have our little ventures. Our games. We all have our little territories. We smuggle, we dodge tariffs and shipping fees, we take ships and ransom them back, we deal in narcotics, some flesh trafficking. The Compact seeks to stop us and so it goes back and forth in our little game. No one wins, but the wheel keeps turning. We keep making money. More some years, less in others.\u201d The pirate lord leaned forward. \u201cThe Red Hand is an uncertain investment, azea haal.You make the other cartels nervous.\u201d", "\u201cGood,\u201d Adrianna flashed her teeth.", "\u201cOnly a primitive such as yourself would see it that way,\u201d Enmet\u2019ej replied. \u201cWe wage our own wars between ourselves over territory, resources \u2013 the usual reasons. These are civilized affairs and when one cartel destroys another, there are rules. Decorum. Protocol.\u201d He tapped the tabletop. \u201cYou broke all of these. The Waiting Noose and the Everlasting Gloaming-\u201d", "\u201c-were in my way,\u201d the human interrupted. \u201cSo I got rid of them.\u201d", "\u201cYou murdered their lords and leaders.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d she smiled. Her red lips stood out against the pale pink hue of her skin. \u201cI did.\u201d", "The \u2018Night Queen\u2019 \u2013 Kasht of the Everlasting Gloaming \u2013 was big, even for a Tribune. She was almost nine feet tall and all of it was muscle. Her tufted ears twitched as she leaned forward, showing far too much d\u00e9colletage for Adrianna\u2019s liking. Tribune anatomy was only just similar enough to human for rough comparisons to be drawn in form and function, but there were still... differences. \u201cYou speak above your station, little spark,\u201d she said wetly, running her tongue over her teeth. Her blind daylight eyes were covered by a silk cloth and her smaller nocturnal eyes focused angrily on her host. \u201cWe came to this meeting out of respect for the blood your small hand has shed, but we will not be spoken to in such a manner by a human.\u201d Her coterie of underlings rumbled agreement.", "\u201cVuld liked my insolence,\u201d Adrianna replied. \u201cHe found it... interesting.\u201d", "\u201cVuld was a fool,\u201d Kasht snapped. \u201cHe allowed himself to be killed by a Broken. Clearly, he was not the fighter nor even the man I thought he was.\u201d", "\u201cI believe we\u2019re getting off topic,\u201d Kebraas Toun, the \u2018Weighted Arbiter\u2019 of the Waiting Noose said. The Judiciary raised a finger on one of his small secondary arms. \u201cWe are here to discuss the Red Hand\u2019s encroachment into our traditional hunting grounds, not retread our personal dislikes.\u201d His cracked-gemstone eyes tightened a little as he focused his attention on Adrianna. \u201cHowsoever much it may be warranted.\u201d", "\u201c\u2018Shut up and focus on the matter at hand\u2019,\u201d Kasht lowered the pitch of her voice, mocking her fellow Unbound leader. \u201cThat\u2019s all that need be said, Toun. Never one word when three will do, eh?\u201d", "\u201cYou were not given permission to use my familiar name, Night Queen,\u201d the Judiciary replied stiffly. \u201cI afford you the courtesy of your station and I expect the same respect be given to my person.\u201d", "\u201cI summoned you here in the hopes of avoiding bloodshed,\u201d Adrianna interjected before Kasht could snarl whatever response came to the Tribune\u2019s mind. \u201cThe Magnameric Canyon has over five hundred star systems; nearly a fifth are inhabited and most of those are worlds are under the purview of the Commission for the Stabilization of Territories and the corporations. To lay all our cards on the table... I want the Canyon to run red with blood. I want CST enforcers and overseers to swing from the lampposts on each of those hundred worlds. I want fires to run through the gated communities, the privileged to have to bar their doors at night in fear of those \u2018lesser races\u2019 they\u2019ve used as serfs for the last thousand years. I want to hear cries of defiance rip from every helot\u2019s throat. That\u2019s what I want. What you want is to run your own small-time games. You want to run drugs, peddle flesh and sack the occasional starship.\u201d She smiled toothily. \u201cI\u2019ll even let you. But you will let the Red Hand into the Canyon, you will stop interfering with our operations and you will stay out of our way.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re insane,\u201d snapped Kasht. \u201cYou want to start a rebellion?\u201d She barked with laughter. \u201cI\u2019d heard that the Broken queen of the Red Hand was bent, but I had no idea how much until now.\u201d", "\u201cThe profitability of your course of action does seem... difficult to assess,\u201d Kebraas put in diplomatically. \u201cI find it difficult to accept that a cartel would forsake all material reward.\u201d", "\u201cI never said we had,\u201d Adrianna replied. \u201cMy profit margins are not your concern.\u201d", "\u201cEnough of this!\u201d Kasht snapped, slamming her fists on the table. \u201cI\u2019ve heard enough. This diseased little sow-\u201d she pointed a finger at Adrianna. \u201c-wants to feed us straight to the Black with her plan. You want to turn the Canyon \u2013 my hunting grounds \u2013 into a meat grinder. The Compact will come in and slaughter you. Whatever small gains you make will be lost. I would gladly watch it all come crashing down around you but except for the small problem of my cartel getting caught in the crossfire!\u201d", "\u201cI must agree with my associate of the Everlasting Gloaming,\u201d Kebraas pointed out. \u201cYour plan will, at best, lead to widespread reprisals against the grey markets and all cartels within the Canyon. At worst, you will destabilize the entire region. That is bad for business.\u201d", "\u201cSo your answer is no?\u201d", "\u201cYou intend to start a war,\u201d the Judiciary pointed out. \u201cI cannot allow that to happen. Your Red Hand is not welcome in the Magnameric Canyon, nor will they ever be. I will grant the forces you have in the region some time to evacuate before I purge them from our holdings.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll do one better,\u201d Kasht replied. \u201cI\u2019ll send each of your people back to you, little spark. It will be up to you to put them back together.\u201d She leaned across the table, her lips curling back from her teeth, the tip of her snout centimeters from Adrianna\u2019s face. \u201cAnd I\u2019m putting a bounty on every one of your whore-born lunatics.\u201d Her voice softened. \u201cIf we catch you... I liked Vuld. You will die, weeping.\u201d", "\u201cI died once,\u201d the human replied. Adrianna put her elbows on the tabletop, lacing her fingers together and rested her chin on the backs of her hands, a signal she had arranged before the meeting. \u201cMaybe you can do better. Then again...\u201d she smiled. \u201cMaybe you can\u2019t.\u201d", "One of Kebraas Toun\u2019s men noticed it first. By agreement, no one had brought any technology into the meeting, but one of the Noosemen had secreted a small augur on his person and it began to ping urgently. \u201cArbiter Kebraas!\u201d the pirate shouted. \u201cThe air...!\u201d", "\u201cI did try,\u201d Adrianna said, a tinge of sadness in her voice. \u201cI would have made you glorious. I would have made the Everlasting Gloaming and Waiting Nooses names to be remembered with awe. Now, it will only be as fools.\u201d", "The Judiciary snatched the device from his underling, his eyes widening as he read the information on it. \u201cYou\u2019re insane!\u201d he waved the augur at Adrianna accusingly. \u201cYou\u2019ll die too!\u201d", "She shrugged. \u201cMaybe.\u201d  Several of the Unbound were already clutching at their throats. \u201cMaybe I just need to live a little longer than you. Maybe I\u2019m the woman who just won\u2019t die.\u201d", "Kasht screamed and lunged for Adrianna, but the human was faster, vaulting out of the Tribune\u2019s reach. Kasht stumbled and fell, gasping. \u201cMy... crew...\u201d", "\u201cIs already dead,\u201d the Red Queen replied. \u201cAnd your flagship won\u2019t know what\u2019s happening until it\u2019s too late.\u201d Her pale skin was turning waxy and greyish and she wavered unsteadily on her feet. \u201cAfter every mad dog in your clans finishes fighting for your positions, the rest will be mine too.\u201d She sunk to her knees, her eyes watering and turning red as capillaries burst within them. \u201cThe Canyon will burn.\u201d She gave a short, girlish giggle, the last sound her guests ever heard \u201c\u2018The fire rises\u2019,\u201d the Red Queen quipped before blackness overtook her.", "\u201cI gave them a fair chance,\u201d Adrianna replied. \u201cThey turned me down.\u201d She made a hang-dog expression. \u201cAnd said some very hurtful things.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m sure they did, but that changes very little,\u201d Enmet\u2019ej informed his counterpart. \u201cOther cartels are nervous around you. You are unpredictable. You fight when you should run. The Compact hates you in a way that they have shown towards very few Unbound. The mere mention of your name and a sector swarms with CSS agents. A sighting of your ships and the starlanes are clogged with the Space Force. These things make life difficult for all of us \u2013 a fact that you will have to get used to if your Red Hand wishes thrive rather than die on the vine.\u201d", "The human made what passed for a thoughtful expression among her species. \u201cI understand,\u201d she said, surprising Enmet\u2019ej. He had expected another barb or a flurry of invective and stringent denials. \u201cI will consider that going forward. But for today... sixty thousand. No less.\u201d", "\u201cSixty and no more,\u201d the Thoughtful agreed. \u201cMy crews will be ready to take custody of the cargo at your convenience.\u201d", "\u201cOnce I get back to my ship, I\u2019ll have my quartermaster get in touch with yours. We\u2019ll arrange the transfer then.\u201d Adrianna stood. She didn\u2019t offer Enmet\u2019ej her hand. Most Thoughtful \u2013 and the lord of the Memetic Virus in particular \u2013 disliked casual physical contact. Just before she reached the door, Enmet\u2019ej spoke.", "\u201cA moment, azea haal.\u201d", "The human woman\u2019s fingers tightened on the doorframe. \u201cI wish people would stop calling me that. It was Vuld\u2019s pet name for me.\u201d", "\u201cMy apologies,\u201d Enmet\u2019ej said, but Adrianna couldn\u2019t tell whether he was sincere or not; probably the latter. \u201cThough I did have a comment.\u201d", "The human arched a single blue eyebrow. The Thoughtful took it as an indication to proceed. \u201cYou surprise me. I have heard many stories of... the \u2018blue fire\u2019. Most, I am sure, are exaggerated \u2013 I have no doubt there are tales of my own accomplishments that far exceed the scope and grandeur of anything I have actually accomplished. However, these stories often describe a, shall we say, less diplomatic Red Queen. I expected something akin to the old tales of humans.\u201d", "\u201cMy dear viral lord,\u201d Adrianna said \u201cYou of all people should take no stock in the stories of old.\u201d", "\u201cPerhaps, but until the first story of the shame of Rally reached my ears, I was of the opinion that humans were merely creatures with Erili\u2019s described \u2018functional mind\u2019.

Many say that we are all that there is in this world. They say there are no gods or goddesses. That prayers go unanswered. They are wrong. The hall is rented, but the orchestra has yet to arrive. The dance won\u2019t begin until the music starts.\u201d Adrianna\u2019s grin widened and the smaller female bowed theatrically, her sparkling blue hair spilling down her shoulders. \u201cThank you for your consideration.\u201d"]}

She was resting on the couch, looking out at the stars. Several of them were not actually stars; they were the ships of her armada. The pirate queen focused on one speck in particular. Rakshasi, Adrianna thought. Seven months ago, it had been the destroyer Stonehewer, just as her Naamah had once been Unwavering Strike. She smiled; her Red Hand was getting very good at boarding operations. Rakshasi and Naamah were the only \u2018true\u2019 warships they\u2019d taken, but they\u2019d also seized several military transports and three attack ships from various mercenary bands. Those corvettes were now Lamashtu, Empusa and Yuki-Onna. The clan called these vessels the vassa anka; \u2018the flayed ones\u2019. A reference to a Tribune story of shapeshifters that hollowed out their prey, leaving only the skin to walk and talk, inhabited by something altogether more malign.", "She liked that.", "The doors to the observation deck opened. Though she gave no sign that she\u2019d heard the visitor, she tracked their approach, augmented senses easily detecting the soft tread of their feet, the sound of the air rustling through their lungs and even the distinctive lub-dub of the heart beating in their chest. She smiled without turning around. \u201cLucas.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll never get used to that,\u201d her second said as he came to stand beside her.

This is supposed to be a spectacle. Spectacles aren\u2019t that impressive if half of the participants get vapourized.\u201d The woman paused, running a hand through her blue hair. It hung down past her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lucas. I shouldn\u2019t bite your head off.\u201d", "\u201cBetter you than anyone else,\u201d the older man said with a smile. \u201cThat turn of phrase was more literal than figurative in some of the places I worked before the Red Hand.\u201d", "Adrianna nodded. \u201cTwenty-two ships...\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019ll be enough,\u201d Lucas assured her. \u201cGetting that many vessels from half a dozen different clans who all hate each other is no minor feat in itself.

I take control of the Cursed Red Gauntlets and suddenly Vuld, a man half this spiral arm was afraid of, was a weakling and a fool. I build the Red Hand into one of the most effective Unbound clans in the region and it\u2019s because there\u2019s no real competition. I come back from the dead and it\u2019s because the Compact doesn\u2019t try hard enough. I take a warship out from under the Space Force\u2019s nose and the security was lax. I\u2019m getting sick of it. Every success I plan, every victory we claim and there\u2019s a reason why a Broken was able to do it and no one else could.\u201d", "\u201cYou set the Magnameric Canyon on fire,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cA hundred worlds are rioting.\u201d", "\u201cA hundred worlds are experiencing unrest,\u201d Adrianna corrected.

In all that time, they didn\u2019t do half as much as we have.\u201d", "\u201cAnd that only gets my foot in the door,\u201d the pirate queen observed. She exhaled sharply. \u201cIf I had enough ships of my own, I wouldn\u2019t even be here, indulging in this bullshit. We could hit the convoy ourselves, then be back in the Canyon, fanning those flames. Instead, we have to coddle pirates, deserters and smugglers who don\u2019t give one fuck about the cause. The ships they\u2019ve sent are a fucking insult, just so they can hedge their bets. If we fail, they haven\u2019t lost much of anything and get to say that they only contributed to see how completely I could fuck things up. If this goes off... well, then they\u2019ve always believed in me and the Red Hand.\u201d She let out another breath, even angrier than before. \u201cAnd I have to thank them for the privilege.\u201d", "Lucas said nothing at first. Many Unbound claimed to have an ideology or a cause that they believed in, but very few did more than offer lip service to those beliefs, as much a criminal cartel as the rest of their fringer brethren. The Red Hand were one of the few exceptions. There were still many who flocked to \u2018azea haal\u2019s\u2019 banner out of greed, but there were far more who\u2019d heard about the Red Queen and dared to hope that even a tenth of the stories about her were true. That she didn\u2019t just fight for wealth and power, but that she actually stood for something. It was this belief that made the bounty on her head one of the highest ever offered. Her agents, demagogues and provocateurs spurred unrest and resentment among the client races as her military raids highlighted the weakness, hypocrisy and uselessness of the Compact.", "\u201cThis coddling will keep the other cartels off our backs as we expand,\u201d Harker commented. \u201cIt\u2019ll convince them that we\u2019re better as allies than as enemies. It will make them realize that you\u2019re someone that they can do business with.\u201d He knew he was parroting Adrianna\u2019s own words back at her, but he could guess what was really bothering her. It wasn\u2019t just the habitual rudeness of the other Unbound lords and ladies or the setbacks they were having with Young Turk. Adrianna had never mentioned it to him, but he\u2019d seen a news dispatch on her desk.", "The Compact had just raised a new regiment from Rally, the 1118th Volunteers. Among them was Pack Leader Samuel Kevin Chiron, one of Adrianna\u2019s cousins. The 1118th was going to be deployed to the Magnameric Canyon to \u2018assist in local peacekeeping efforts\u2019. Someone in Force Command had a sick sense of humour.", "\u201cI know,\u201d the young woman said with a nod. \u201cI know. Well,\u201d she forced a grin. \u201cSince everyone\u2019s here, I suppose we should make the introductions.\u201d", "~", "As a heavy cruiser, Naamah\u2019s conference room was easily large enough to hold all the assembled ship leaders, pirate nobles and their various entourages \u2013 but only just. The room was a riot of colour and fashion, as if each of the Unbound present were trying to outdo each other in the pomposity, garishness and impracticality of their outfits. The cartels that had responded to Adrianna\u2019s overtures might indeed be hedging their bets, but knowing that the others would be here was a chance to flaunt their own wealth and power over their rivals. The conference room was abuzz with noise, a half dozen different languages and twice that many dialects as the pirates argued, gossiped, bartered with and threatened one another. None of them paid much attention to the time, fully expecting the human to abide by the unspoken rules of protocol and force them to wait. The less self-aware of the group sneered in condescension, wondering aloud if the Red Queen was so petty as to make the guests she\u2019d invited cool their heels.", "They did not, in fact have to wait.", "Contrasting sharply with the many different styles on display, the Red Hand\u2019s queen wore a simple black outfit, cut and styled in a military fashion, but without the overdone epaulettes, custom rank insignia and decals that many of her counterparts bedecked themselves with. Her concessions to vanity were few: a stylized bloody handprint on her left breast and small flame pattern at her cuffs and waist. When she entered the room, the conversation slowly began to die away until the assembled pirates were silent, waiting for their hostess to speak.", "\u201cYou know who I am,\u201d Leblanc said without preamble. \u201cYou know each other. Now that we\u2019ve been introduced, it\u2019s time to get down to business. Everyone\u2019s here who\u2019s coming, so we\u2019re moving ahead as planned.\u201d There was a stir at these words. They wanted more ships. Adrianna ignored the murmurs. \u201cWe received word from our agents in Harseen\u2019s operations \u2013 the convoy moved out as scheduled, but the guilders are nervous \u2013 it\u2019s possible someone from your organizations, or one of the cartels who chose not to participate, leaked the information-\u201d", "\u201cOur organizations?\u201d Group Leader Banh (and two names besides) interrupted. \u201cHow do we know it wasn\u2019t one of yours?\u201d", "Adrianna blinked slowly, meeting the Tribune\u2019s cybernetic eyes. \u201cThere are two types of people who serve in the Red Hand,\u201d she said. \u201cThose who believe so fully in our cause that they would never betray us and those who remember what I did to the traitors who told the Compact about Unicorn Set. Does that answer satisfy you, or shall I prepare a detailed briefing on my counter-intelligence operations?\u201d", "Banh sneered, but did not object further. \u201cAs I was saying,\u201d Adrianna continued, \u201cThe guilders are nervous and they\u2019ve added to the escort\u2019s strength. Our sources indicate a further two support ships, although we were unable to discern weight and class.\u201d", "That provoked another, stronger series of murmurs. \u201cTheir presence is irrelevant,\u201d the human said firmly. \u201cThey\u2019d have to be exceptionally powerful to offset Naamah\u2019s presence, in which case we break and run as planned for. If they\u2019re not, then they can\u2019t affect the outcome.\u201d", "\u201cThat is an easy thing to say when you are sitting behind the screens of your own heavy cruiser,\u201d another Unbound spoke up to several affirming comments and gestures. \u201cFor the rest of us, it may be a greater source of disquiet.\u201d", "Adrianna\u2019s expression remained carefully neutral as she stared back at the Judiciary. \u201cYour concerns were already addressed. I explained the mission parameters to your lord. This mission will be dangerous, but it will be very lucrative. If you are unwilling to fulfill your obligations because something we anticipated might happen happened, you can return to the Weeping Knives and explain it to your lord yourself. Or if you like, Leader Septees, before the mission I can put on a skirt,\u201d the corner\u2019s of Adrianna\u2019s mouth curled upwards. \u201cSo that you can cower behind it.\u201d", "The Judiciary\u2019s jaw clicked shut, his secondary arms folding across his chest as several of his colleagues sent jeers his way.", "Adrianna waited a moment for the catcalls to die down. \u201cIf we\u2019re done with the interruptions, I can continue with the mission briefing for Operation Six Days. We\u2019ll be carrying out a standard spider-hole ambush but with the following changes....\u201d", "~", "\u201cMultiple synchronized shockpoints,\u201d Scopes reported. \u201cDefinitely a mass emergence.\u201d", "Adrianna was slouched in her throne, a perfect picture of arrogance and command. \u201cShip count?\u201d", "\u201cStill sorting through signals,\u201d Sensors replied. \u201cCounting...twenty drive wakes, I think.\u201d", "\u201cFourteen transports and the security force,\u201d Lucas mused aloud.

Her fingers tapped on the control panels in the arms, bringing up each officer\u2019s information to her. She wished she could do more, but her cybernetics didn\u2019t allow her to interface with external systems. \u201cWeight of the proctors?\u201d she demanded.", "\u201cFive escort-class. Wait one. One of the drive signatures is different. It could be a heavy destroyer, or-\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s a cruiser,\u201d Adrianna cut her augur operator off. \u201cProbably the Chastening Hand. Group Leader Harim is good at hunting outlaws.\u201d She grinned savagely, leaning forward in her chair. \u201cComm our allies and make sure they\u2019ve still got clean pants. Shift the fleet\u2019s attack pattern to Yellow Two.\u201d She\u2019d kept the options few and simple; most Unbound were commensurate killers, but that was all they were \u2013 murderers.

The savage who\u2019d murdered one of her betters, who\u2019d had the audacity to stand before them and tell them that he\u2019d deserved it. You didn\u2019t say those things, not on Rally. Not of their \u2018saviours\u2019 in the Compact. You certainly didn\u2019t kill a Tribune. Even a criminal. No, you sat there and took it when some sneering, swaggering scum tried to extort and threaten your family. You let the authorities handle it, the same authorities who ate at the same restaurants, played the same games of veldt and laughed at the same jokes as that man. That was what you did.", "You didn\u2019t use the skills you\u2019d learned sitting at your father\u2019s knee to put a bomb on that criminal\u2019s car and when he laughed at you when you called him and told him to leave your family alone, you didn\u2019t send his superior ass to Hell in seven different directions.", "Seventeen-year old Adrianna Leblanc had watched the burning husk of that limousine and felt something she\u2019d never felt before. Twenty years later and she still remembered that warmth. It came to her every time she saw a Compact warship burning against the stars.", "\u201cChastening Hand is crippled,\u201d Tactical reported, confirming what the pirate queen already knew.", "\u201cBoarding teams are ready,\u201d Operations piped up.", "\u201cSend them after the transports as we planned,\u201d Adrianna ordered. Her eyes never left the cratered, smouldering wreck of the smaller cruiser she\u2019d cut down. Harim was a good tactician \u2013 he\u2019d known he could never take Naamah alone, but he could inflict grievous damage on the rest of the Unbound. He\u2019d focused on them, forcing Adrianna to shift to fleet defence instead of protecting herself. When Chastening Hand had suddenly shifted targeting and thrown everything at the heavy cruiser, he almost took her by surprise, which could have meant a badly damaged or even crippled Naamah...", "...but \u2018almost\u2019 wasn\u2019t enough.", "A few heads turned towards her. Chastening Hand was ready for the taking; the longer they waited, the more time the surviving Compact crew had to dig in, to prepare for boarders and to ready the vessel\u2019s self-destruct. She did want the ship, but she needed the convoy\u2019s cargo more. \u201cSend a message to Group Leader Harim,\u201d she said. \u201cCongratulate him on a battle well fought. Tell him that I know that Local Command has mentioned severe consequences for the next leader who loses their ship to me. Tell him also that if he doesn\u2019t abandon ship, I\u2019ll open fire until I know everyone aboard is dead and then salvage the hulk. If he wants to avoid that, there will be no living soul left on that ship in fifteen minutes.", "\u201cBe sure to tell him that he can wipe his databases, but if I find any sabotage aboard the vessel, I will kill him. Him, his crew and the survivors of this convoy.\u201d Adrianna\u2019s blue gaze hardened. \u201cBe sure he\u2019s aware that if he chooses to destroy his ship, I will make sure everyone in the Canyon knows that he chose his pride over the lives of tens of thousands. Let him wonder how that will play in a sector already rioting over the Compact\u2019s injustices.\u201d Adrianna turned away, looking to the tactical hologram and the drifting, bleeding wrecks of the convoy. \u201cNow, let\u2019s collect our due.\u201d", "~", "Lucas handed Adrianna a \u2018scroll. \u201cFinal tallies.\u201d", "The woman accepted it, keying through the information. \u201cWhat\u2019s the damage?\u201d", "\u201cVery little. Rakshasi\u2019s hits aren\u2019t as bad as they seemed at the time. We can make good almost everything at Minos Perch and if we need to, visit Blackbag for the rest.\u201d", "Adrianna gritted her teeth. The destroyer had been engaged by one of the Compact escorts and had briefly lost power, leaving Naamah\u2019s flank dangerously unprotected. Rakshasi\u2019s power grid had been finicky ever since they took the ship, but this was the first time it had affected the destroyer\u2019s performance in combat. \u201cTell Leader Kuumal that if Faithful Loovan can\u2019t do what he promised, then I\u2019m going to find Rakshasi an engineer who can,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cIf Kuumal or Loovan send one of my ships into battle like this again, it will be the last time it happens.\u201d Leblanc looked over the rest of her damage; there was very little. Surprise and overwhelming firepower had done much to hamper the convoy\u2019s proctors. Even her allies had taken fewer losses than she\u2019d feared. The spectacle had gone off nicely, it seemed.", "The prizes, though \u2013 twelve of the transports were still salvageable, two having been the victims of over-enthusiastic gunners from the Sacrificers of the Young and Blackened Soles. Most of the freighters had struck their colours the instant that Chastening Hand was turned into a wreck. The others had needed only a little encouragement. One of the Compact escorts had disengaged after the cruiser had fallen, a second had been broken in half by Naamah\u2019s guns, a third torn to piece by the frenzied Unbound attack and the other two had been hulked by the vassa anka and the other Unbound. In fact, the pirates were squabbling over them right now. Adrianna had no interest in those ships; her allies could consider them an unexpected bonus.", "Now it was time to divide the spoils. Adrianna had claimed 4 of the ships for herself. There had been some grumbling over that \u2013 more pronounced now that the others\u2019 share had dropped from 10 hulls to 8 \u2013 but the Red Hand had organized this ambush, planned it, executed it and expended more resources and munitions than the others. \u201cWhat do we have here?\u201d Adrianna said, thumbing through the manifests the defeated transport leaders had sent over.", "\u201cIt\u2019s just what you thought,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cThey were hoping that we either wouldn\u2019t notice or wouldn\u2019t hit a convoy this big.\u201d", "\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have without the other cartels,\u201d Adrianna acknowledged. \u201cNot without taking so much damage that we\u2019d be lucky to break even.\u201d The Red Hand, if nothing else, was known for its defiance of established Unbound doctrines. They\u2019d hit three military transports in the Magnameric Canyon in the last year alone, destroying two of them outright, forcing both local military and commercial interests to rely on the convoy system to protect themselves from the raids. With that had come the predictable slowing of the movement of cargo throughout the region. Shortages of luxury and high-value goods were already occurring on a handful of worlds. It wasn\u2019t austerity measures by any means, but it was getting there.", "It had been Local Command\u2019s hope that using the Harseen Transport Consortium\u2019s ships to move munitions and supplies to the \u2018peacekeeping\u2019 forces would keep them safe from the Red Hand\u2019s predation. It might have worked: with most of the few ships the Red Hand had spread throughout the Canyon, all Adrianna had had available were her vassa anka.", "With the increased reliance on convoys came the increased protection from Unbound attack. The other cartels resented the Red Hand for the loss of hijacking opportunities. Normally Adrianna wouldn\u2019t have cared, but she was trying to be more diplomatic, as Emmet\u2019ej had suggested. That was why she\u2019d approached the other cartels with this plan \u2013 they provided support for her heavier ships and she provided the firepower needed to break the convoy\u2019s escorts. If it had just been her vassa anka, the proctor ships could have marshalled themselves against her. She had Naamah and Rakshasi and her trio of mercenary corvettes, but the escort had had five actual warships.", "Fighting on even terms was a bad idea even for a military commander; for someone whose profit margins mean the difference between life and death, it was even worse. Fortunately, she\u2019d managed to deliver what she promised. The cartels might quibble over their shares, but they had made decent profits from this venture. And what did she have?", "She had another step towards an uprising... and she had Harseen Ubiqqen and its seventeen million tonnes of ammunition, weaponry and personal armour once destined for the Ground Force and CST Security Force units in the Magnameric Canyon. \u201cUbiqqen is ours,\u201d she told Lucas. \u201cWe\u2019ll also take the Harseen Garibeadian, Harseen Ironmaker and Harseen Senharim. Ransom the ships and crews back to the company. Keep the cargo; we\u2019ll get more for it on the black market. We\u2019ll offload it at Blackbag and then head to the perch.\u201d", "\u201cAnd Chastening Hand? Have you got a name picked out for it yet?\u201d", "Adrianna sighed. \u201cScrap pile #17.\u201d", "Lucas blinked. \u201cI thought-\u201d", "\u201cI know. I want to salvage it too, but we can\u2019t. We don\u2019t have the crew for it and we can\u2019t afford it.\u201d Adrianna stroked the bulkhead. \u201cYou know how much Naamah costs to operate.\u201d", "McEnroy nodded. Keeping the heavy cruiser at full capability was one of the Red Hand\u2019s largest expenses. Even the largest Unbound cartels would be hard-pressed to run more than one capital ship at a time. \u201cSo what do you want to do?\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019ll take it under tow. Once we\u2019re clear from the system, send Juum-ope-cand over to inventory what\u2019s there. We\u2019ll take everything we need from it and either sell the hulk to another cartel or keep it for whatever comes up. Now,\u201d Adrianna handed the \u2018scroll back to her second in command. \u201cSend out the prize crews and get the ships ready to move out. Operation Six Days is finished.\u201d", "~", "\u201cSo,\u201d Vuld rumbled deep in his throat as he looked down at the human. The Broken had a leash around her neck. A pair of his soldiers flanked the smaller creature, looking at it with anger and contempt. The faintest metallic reek of the sow\u2019s blood hung in the air, sickeningly red blood spattered against corpse-pale skin. \u201cThis is Rally\u2019s shame, is it? This is the Broken that thinks itself worthy of joining my Cursed Red Gauntlets?\u201d", "Adrianna lifted her head at the Unbound lord\u2019s words. \u201cIt is,\u201d she said, daring to look Vuld in the eyes. She hissed as one of her guards pulled hard on the chain around her neck, pulling her so hard that she lost her balance and fell, climbing back to her feet awkwardly.", "\u201cDon\u2019t speak without being spoken to, Broken,\u201d Gahein snapped.", "Vuld chortled, rising from his throne. \u201cShe must terrify you,\u201d he said to Gahein. \u201cTo have her leashed like this.\u201d", "The other Tribune stiffened. \u201cThe animal killed two of my men.\u201d", "\u201cYour men?

And if they died to a human, of all things, then I think I have traded upwards.\u201d He chuckled, ignoring the way Gahein and the other guard stiffened at his dismissal of their friends but relishing the fear that held any outburst in check. \u201cSo tell me,\u201d he said, leaning in over the human. He\u2019d never seen one in the flesh before. Gods, she was an ugly thing. A face almost as flat as a Thoughtful\u2019s, with two eyes. Instead of the normal single hue, they were a mixture of white sclera and blue irises. \u201cLeave us,\u201d the Unbound lord ordered his men. He took the leash from Gahein, pulling the human along as he marched back to his throne, slouching into it and pouring a goblet of wine for himself. \u201cSo tell me,\u201d he mused, taking a gulp. \u201cHow did you kill two of my men?\u201d", "\u201cI rigged the room to explode,\u201d she answered, glaring back at him.

Why did you do this thing?\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s a bounty on my head,\u201d the human explained. \u201cRally\u2019s waiting to execute me.

You humiliated him.\u201d", "\u201cGood,\u201d the human said, flashing her tiny white teeth. \u201cTribunes need to know humility every once and again.\u201d", "Vuld took a deeper drink from his goblet this time and chortled deep in his throat. \u201cPerhaps we do.\u201d Curious, he reached out and touched the creature\u2019s mane. He had never felt hair before. It was soft than a Tribune\u2019s own mane and blue, like the human\u2019s eyes. Each strand gleamed slightly under the light. \u201cA strange colour,\u201d he commented.", "\u201cI was gene-modded.\u201d", "\u201cIndeed?\u201d Vuld arched an eyebrow, genuinely surprised. \u201cI had heard that that was forbidden to client races.\u201d", "\u201cCosmetic alterations are still allowed, especially if you know the right people.\u201d the Broken answered. \u201cMy grandparents were wealthy.\u201d", "\u201cAh,\u201d Vuld leaned in closer.

You think you will be the one to teach it to us?\u201d", "The human made a noise then; it could have been a growl. \u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cI have heard how weak Broken are,\u201d Vuld mused aloud, pulling the human closer still. \u201cThat they are menials with some small gifts here and there, but do nothing that any other species cannot do better. That they are a child-race whose only claim to greatness is that a handful of them managed to escape the calamity that befell their homeworld... and even then you needed our help to survive. I look at you and I do not see weakness. Not yet. I see something burning,\u201d he touched her hair again. \u201cAzea haal \u2013 the blue fire. Welcome to the Cursed Red Gauntlets.\u201d", "The human was trying to pull back from him, but there was not enough slack in her leash to do so. \u201cI have a name,\u201d she said fiercely.", "Vuld laughed again. \u201cPerhaps one day I\u2019ll learn it.\u201d His free hand left her mane, cupping her face, turning it this way and that. \u201cGods, but you are ugly. I cannot imagine what tricks Fortune played upon your evolution to make you this way.\u201d His black tongue slid out and ran up her neck and cheek, the Unbound tasting the raw flavour of human sweat and blood. He felt her shudder against his touch, straining away from him, but there was nowhere she could go.", "\u201cWell then,\u201d he growled low in his throat as his hand slid down her body, one finger hooking into the V of her blouse. The fabric ripped easily. \u201cLet\u2019s see how ugly you really are.\u201d", "~", "Adrianna woke up, clutching for the pistol she kept under her pillow. Her heart was pounding and her skin was covered in cold, clammy sweat. Just a dream, she told herself, setting the weapon back down. Just a dream. But it was worse than a dream, wasn\u2019t it? A dream was something you were afraid of, something you wanted, something that wasn\u2019t real \u2013 that had never been real. If only.", "The woman held herself tightly, digging her fingers into her arms. She took a breath, let it out, slowing the frantic beating in her chest. She was alone. She was alone. Her skin was still crawling, as if she could still feel his hands on her. Those were her dreams now: memories. They were almost always ugly ones. The jeering crowds as she was led to the courthouse. Being surrounded by the other prisoners. The trial \u2013 the verdict and sentencing. Vuld. Those she could handle. Those gave her purpose, a focus for her anger.", "Sometimes, only sometimes, she had the worst dreams of all. The scent of her mother\u2019s hair. The smile on her father\u2019s face as he sat her on his knee and showed her how to make things work. The sound of waves on Homestead Beach from the day they\u2019d picnicked there and her mother taught her how to fly a kite. The warm summer rain as she ran and shrieked and whooped through it, her father scooping her up in his arms, holding her close. Those dreams ended in the worst possible way. They didn\u2019t fade into horror, into burning corpses or judgemental faces, blood or fire \u2013 they just ended, like every other dream.", "\u201cI killed you,\u201d Adrianna said into the silence, still holding herself. She felt dirty. \u201cI killed you.\u201d She pushed the feelings of fear and powerlessness away, clutching instead to other emotions. The warmth she\u2019d felt as she watched that limousine burn. The satisfaction of seeing Vuld\u2019s eyes going dim as his ruined heart beat its last, her hand deep in his chest. She remembered the words she\u2019d spoken once before. \u201cThe killing will never stop,\u201d she said quietly.", "~", "\u201cPreparing for emergence,\u201d Navigation commented. \u201cT-minus three minutes.\u201d", "Leblanc nodded. She was looking forward to some down time \u2013 such as it was. She\u2019d offloaded all the crews, four of the prize ships and their cargo on Blackbag. Emmet\u2019ej would handle the ransoms ships and crew as well as the fencing of the cargo. The Viral Lord preferred such \u2018clean\u2019 businesses and handled them very efficiently. The Red Hand was better at the messier side of things. Adrianna was learning about the former \u2013 but she didn\u2019t have the connections that Emmet\u2019ej did. As he\u2019d pointed out, the Red Hand\u2019s reputation often preceded them. Not always for the better. It was easier (and more profitable) to allow the Thoughtful to handle those deals, even with the extra skim that she knew he indulged himself in. At least until her own network was the equal of his \u2013 or she had to kill him.", "The Memetic Virus was not a militarily strong cartel; their influence was in soft power and their network of contacts. Losing that would be a blow, but a survivable one. By the same token, Emmet\u2019ej and the rest of his Unbound had grown into the vacuum created by Adrianna\u2019s decapitation of the Everlasting Gloaming and the Waiting Noose. The Red Hand\u2019s raids brought them a lot of money and power. For the moment, the two factions were in a commensal relationship.", "For the moment.", "The other cartels were slightly more predisposed towards her now as they hauled their riches back to their own lairs. Several had already expressed interest in purchasing Chastening Hand, if only to because a mere human had a heavy cruiser and it offended their sense of propriety. Well, whoever wanted it enough to pay for it could have it. A fool and his money...", "All in all, it had been a good excursion.", "But she was tired.

The galaxy was full of little secrets like these. You just had to know where to look.", "The woman stood, stretching her legs. Minos Perch was in orbit of one of this nameless system\u2019s outermost unremarkable gas giants, but it was still a sixteen-hour slog to get there from the outer shock limit.", "A handful of minutes passed as the Unbound ships headed towards their base, spreading out into a defensive envelope.

All recording devices had been shut off, all security cameras deactivated. There would be no record of what happened here.

Since her reconstruction, she was a lot less vulnerable to vacuum, but she didn\u2019t enjoy exposure to it. She grinned at another warm memory. As I recall, neither did Voaml... but fair was fair, since he blew me out into space first. I just returned the favour.", "Through the transparent metal window of the airlock door, she could see him, laughing as he trudged back up the corridor, already thinking she was dead. Warning messages flashed across her HUD and she dismissed them with a thought. She was braced against the side of the station, the magnetics in her boots keeping her from drifting into space. She\u2019d come here to parley for trading rights and instead the treacherous Ar\u2019densai bastard depressurized the entire section, sending her and her escort into space. She\u2019d managed to get enough of a handhold for her magnetics to anchor her, but her escorts hadn\u2019t been as lucky. She didn\u2019t know what Voaml was thinking, who\u2019s orders he was following, but that didn\u2019t matter right now.", "The airlock was sealed; even with her augmented strength, she\u2019d never be able to force it open. Luckily, she didn\u2019t need to. She still had her weapons. Why not? What good would a pistol and a sword do to someone choking on nothing?", "Let me show you.", "She slammed her fist against the door, hard enough that the sound carried through the hull. Voaml paused, turning around. The Worker\u2019s eyes widened in shock as he saw Adrianna, the surprise turning to fear as she raised her khopesh and thumbed the activation stud. The baleblade\u2019s disruption field flared to life and she rammed it through the door, the metal melting and bubbling as she sawed through the airlock, shoving the door inward and climbing inside. Voaml was shouting into his comm, gesturing for his guards to shoot her, but the inner door was too thick for their bullets. She cut into the bulkhead, exposing the manual release for the second door and pulled on it. The doors opened with a gust of atmosphere, the woman driving her blade into the release mechanism and jamming it open. No one could shut it again.", "She braced herself against the gale, flat against the wall as the first of the enemy guards lost his footing and fell into the stars. The second followed a moment later. Voaml himself had managed a handhold, the Worker\u2019s prodigious strength keeping him in place. Decompression doors had sealed, isolating this section. With the airlock still open, the only way out was the elevator at the end of the hallway... and it would only open for the person holding Voaml\u2019s rank cylinder. He realized this a few seconds after Adrianna did, thumping and bouncing his way to salvation as she bounded after him, the Ar\u2019densai wheezing on nothing as his body cried out for air.", "He was a third of the way to the elevator before she pounced on him, wrapping her arms around his throat. He roared silently, instinctively trying to rear back and crush her against the wall, but he lost his footing and slipped. Desperate, he crawled towards the elevator, his tongue hanging out of his mouth, his eyes bulging and turning red as capillaries burst inside them. Finally, he stopped moving and Adrianna climbed off him, snagging his code cylinder and opening the security doors. Precious air rushed into her lungs, the sweetest thing she\u2019d ever known...", "The drone slid into the bay. It was a sleek gull-winged thing with a narrow hull and forward-swept radiator fins. It was almost Compact standard, but it had been modified extensively. Waste not, want not, Adrianna thought with a smile. She stepped over to the drone\u2019s main hatch and opened it. Inside was the access point for the automaton\u2019s data core. Instead of instructions for downloading information, the small screen had a different message:", "+we need to talk+", "Adrianna stared at the message for a long moment and then she smiled, suddenly no longer tired at all."]}

You\u2019re not her. You\u2019re not a person. You-you\u2019re a program. A thing, an abomination. Like one of the Devoured\u2019s... like one of their husks. Machinery puppeting meat.\u201d", "She didn\u2019t bother trying to refute him. You couldn\u2019t argue with irrational fear. \u201cTurn around,\u201d Adrianna told the doctor. \u201cThis can still be forgiven. Turn the car around and come back.

I- Triarchs forgive me.\u201d", "\u201cI took you in,\u201d Adrianna said gently. \u201cI gave you a place amongst us. After what you did, you\u2019d either be in jail or dead.

After a moment, the young woman left the small room, joining the rest of her troops. ", "Red One was a capable and quick surgeon. The procedure was taking less time than Adrianna expected, though she\u2019d still sent a message to her crew shortly before the operation, telling them (in somewhat diplomatic terms) that she was fine, she would be away for several hours and they were still under strict blackout conditions, but the core of her message could be boiled down to, \u2018I\u2019m fine, so sit down and shut up\u2019.", "She looked over as the surgeon closed up her left arm, meat and machine blending together, the skin folding back over it and seamlessly sealing back up. A scroll of diagnostics appeared across Adrianna vision, confirming the implants were operational. She flexed her fingers experimentally. They moved better than they had for two years, since she\u2019d been shot in the wrist.", "Next was her right leg.", "Just a little bit longer and she\u2019d be done. Adrianna was almost giddy with the thought of testing her \u2018new\u2019 body out... and even more with learning what it was that Red One had planned.", "~", "The pinnace settled back onto the deck with the customary exhibition of Adrianna\u2019s piloting grace \u2013 which was to say, she put it down without damaging anything. The boarding ramp lowered with a hiss of released air, softly clunking against Naamah\u2019s deck. Lucas stirred to attention, the handful of officers, armsmen and security personnel doing likewise. Black-booted feet came down the ramp. Legs covered in dark false-leather leggings, a vaguely military jacket hanging open over the grey tunic beneath. Long blue hair glinted in the landing bay\u2019s lights and blue eyes danced mischievously. \u201cMatron,\u201d one of the assembled coterie began. \u201cWe await your command.\u201d", "\u201cGood,\u201d the pirate queen replied, breezing past her entourage. They followed her like smaller vessels swept up in a battleship\u2019s wake. \u201cThe blackout will remain in effect for another seventeen hours,\u201d she ordered. \u201cAfter which time, we\u2019ll plot a course back to Minos Perch. No, you don\u2019t get to know what happened. No, you don\u2019t get to know who or what I met, or even if I did meet anyone and didn\u2019t just want to fuck with you.\u201d She stepped into a tram car, gesturing to several of her officers, Lucas among them, to accompany her further. \u201cEngineering.\u201d", "As the car moved through Naamah guts, the heavy cruiser\u2019s second officer spoke up. \u201cEngineering reports no issues, matron. Why-\u201c he paused, looked at the others in the car, but all of them averted eye contact. Lucas smirked slightly. No one ever wanted to be first into see how cold the water was. \u201cWhy are we heading there?\u201d", "Adrianna smiled. She was quick to smile, but as everyone in the Red Hand \u2013 and more than a few outside it \u2013 knew, this was not always a good thing. \u201cWe have a Builder in Engineer,\u201d she replied. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got something that needs to be built.\u201d", "~", "Builders annoyed Adrianna.", "Her chief engineer, Juum-ope-cand, was no exception. The bulging eyes, the liquid, rolling way they moved, the ragdoll limbs that twitched and wobbled like severed lizard\u2019s tails... those she could handle. What irritated her was that they were always so damn happy. Even when they were actually angry, upset or sad they sounded pleased.", "\u201cRed Queen. Yes. Good to see. Was worried. Ship is silent, scopes are quiet. Worrisome,\u201d Juum-ope-cand bubbled exuberantly, his translated voice barely audible over his normal language. \u201cNaamah wants to fly, to hunt, to hurt. Enjoys it.\u201d His wide eyes blinked. \u201cLike our queen, yes.\u201d", "\u201cI have something for you,\u201d Adrianna said, drawing a data drive out of her tunic. She handed it to the Builder. One of his long, tentacle-like arms reached for it, his delicate little fingers accepting the drive. He wobbled over to the nearest computer console. Builders were the youngest of the ruling races, but renegades could be found in all works of life.", "Builders were a short species, generally less than six feet tall with wide faces, several Jacobson\u2019s organs in place of a nose and large, blubbery lips. Their skin was always slightly translucent, tinted blue, green, purple or some combination of those hues. With their rotund bodies and stumpy little legs, they seemed almost comical, like those wide-bottomed dolls that rocked back and forth on the floor, but underestimating them due to their speech patterns or their appearance was a mistake. Their vision was among the best of any species and they had mind-bogglingly precise fine motor control with those dexterous little fingers. They could visualize an object three-dimensionally, even if showed only one side of it and possessed a nearly preternatural affinity for construction and design. They were meticulous workers, with an incredible gift for engineering, architecture and technology.", "It was said that if you gave a Builder something, on the first day they\u2019d play with it. On the second, they\u2019d take it apart and on the third, they would have built you a better version of it. If they had one flaw it was that their mindset was to imitate and improve, not necessarily innovate. It wasn\u2019t that the entire species was unimaginative or unable to invent new things \u2013 they\u2019d never have raised themselves out of their prehistory if they couldn\u2019t do that \u2013 but nine times out of ten, Builders preferred to tweak existing concepts rather than try to make something new. Their greatest technological advancements usually came about because of they were unable to improve what they already had any further. They\u2019d used (ever more efficient and capable) prop-driven aircraft for over two hundred years before some radical thinker invented the jet engine.", "There didn\u2019t even seem to be any societal or cultural reason for this conservatism. It was just... how their minds worked. They were fastidious and highly sought-after technical specialists, but they always preferred sticking with what had been \u2018proven\u2019 to work rather than risk something new and untested.", "Juum-ope-cand brought up the data, his eyes goggling at it. He turned back to Adrianna. \u201cOur queen brings something new, yes. Something unexpected. Have not seen these before. No.\u201d", "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lucas asked, stepping over to the console. His eyes widened as he looked at the display. \u201cWait. Is that...?\u201d", "\u201cJackal technology, yes. Missile drives. Chasses. Warheads. Old technology. Not modern, no.\u201d", "Adrianna coquettishly touched a finger to her lips. \u201cBut better than what we have now, yes?\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d the Builder said, dexterous fingers dancing along the control board, subsetting the data into multiple screens, his eyes swivelling between each smaller window. \u201cExpended Naamah\u2019s onboard ordnance. No capital missiles left. No designs, no sources. Other ships use fringe-built missiles. The clans steal a handful here, a handful there. Not as effective as the Space Force. Always the way. Until now, yes.\u201d", "\u201cCan you build them?\u201d", "Juum-ope-cand turned back to Adrianna, stiffening with professional pride. \u201cI am Builder. Yes. I build. I will make these.\u201d He bubbled something to himself, turning back to the data. \u201cDifficult to make to Jackal specifications. Expensive.\u201d", "\u201cDo what we can afford.\u201d Adrianna leaned over the smaller Builder. \u201cThere\u2019s more on the drive. Go through it. Tell me what we can do now, and what we\u2019ll need to work our way up to.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Juum-ope-cand answered, barely registering the human\u2019s presence any longer as he looked lovingly at the technical specs of the Red Hand\u2019s newest weapon.", "~", "Word spread quickly throughout Naamah, anxiety and uncertainty replaced with excitement and curiousity. Adrianna remained tight-lipped on the exact nature of their mission here, but that only fuelled the rumours. The data she\u2019d brought back was worth a fortune. There were the specifications for military grade weapons and technology \u2013 although they were generally outdated, last-generation technology, that still put them beyond what the Unbound usually made do with. Nothing cutting-edge and certainly nothing of Nemesis; the former strained the bounds of what an Unbound cartel \u2013 even one like the Red Hand \u2013 was capable of and as soon as the latter was recognized, it would bring the Compact\u2019s full fury down on Leblanc and her clan, far too soon.", "There was also account information and personal access codes belonging to many of the oligarchs and mega-corporations of the Magnameric Canyon. Adrianna couldn\u2019t imagine how Red One had gotten that kind of information. Well. She could imagine several different ways. There were also other little bits and pieces of data, useful fragments that the warship had recovered during her raids throughout the Compact. She couldn\u2019t act on them directly, but through an appropriate cat\u2019s paw? Maybe.", "Adrianna smiled, her eyes alight as she scrolled through the data. This was more than she\u2019d ever dreamed. She had hackers of her own, still others freelanced on her payroll. They\u2019d managed good pulls before, but this was another order entirely. Secrets, lies and hidden truths all buried and hidden for years. Bits and pieces that Adrianna had hoped to be able to use, but could never get... while Red One had been able to find them, but couldn\u2019t exploit them. It was a perfect symbiosis.", "The woman leaned back in her chair. If she used this information to its full extent, she\u2019d committing her clan to outright war. To the Long War, a battle none of them knew about, many wouldn\u2019t have cared about and even more would have been horrified to learn of.", "\u2018If\u2019. Now, that was funny \u2013 there was no \u2018if\u2019 for her. It was \u2018when\u2019. It had been when ever since she\u2019d sat down at her father\u2019s workbench with a pile of electronics and explosives in front of her and known that this was the only way to protect her family. The system didn\u2019t work, not if you were the people at the bottom. It protected those at the top, those with the money and the power and the laws to say that everyone else was less. When it became that rotten, that filled with corruption and self-serving, self-righteous monsters... then it had to be burnt down. She\u2019d sacrifice her life for that. She\u2019d sacrifice others for it. Kill them, lie, cheat, steal and murder all for the sake of a vision that might not ever come true. They called her a monster, thought of her a something unclean and shameful. Let them. Let them spit on her memory for the next thousand years, or let her die alone and unremarked and forgotten. Just as long as she could fight before she died and hope that it would mean something.", "That was the most important lesson she\u2019d learned back on Rally. Sometimes, you had to fight. You couldn\u2019t talk your way out of it, you couldn\u2019t back down, you couldn\u2019t do anything but make the other person bleed. It didn\u2019t matter if you won or lost, it didn\u2019t matter if anyone noticed or cared. It only mattered because you had to do it \u2013 you couldn\u2019t let them get away with what they were doing. No one had wanted to hear that. They\u2019d all loved the Compact, been against that she could kill such a respected man as Commissioner Sath.", "That was why she wouldn\u2019t stop, not until they finally managed to kill her.", "\u201cThe fire rises,\u201d she said to herself. Vincere vel mori.", "The comm beeped, pulling her out of her melancholy. \u201cYou have a visitor, matron.\u201d It was Jhan, one of her armsmen. She didn\u2019t like the feeling of being watched and guarded everywhere she went, but it was part of the act. No Unbound queen would be seen anywhere without an appropriate entourage and a coterie of exceptionally lethal bodyguards was just one part of that. Adrianna made less use of them than others might, but as Lucas was fond of pointing out, she wasn\u2019t invulnerable. She\u2019d survived more than anyone thought possible, but she could die... and they had come in handy more than once.", "Speaking of Lucas, that was him on the security feed, standing outside the door to her quarters, blocked by her armsmen. Even the second in command of the Red Hand\u2019s military didn\u2019t get unimpeded access to the \u2018Red Queen\u2019s\u2019 personal chambers. \u201cSend him in,\u201d she told Jhan. On the monitor, the Tribune\u2019s head moved in a small, choppy nod and he and his confederate stepped aside for Harker.", "Lucas strode over to Adrianna\u2019s desk. \u201cMy queen,\u201d he said with utter formality.", "The woman leaned back in her chair. \u201cColumn leader.\u201d", "Silence stretched. \u201cWho was it?\u201d Harker pointed past her, to the window. It wasn\u2019t showing the local starfield, but instead the view was set to a panorama from some distant nebula, gentle violet, blue and red washing into the room. \u201cWho\u2019s out there, Adrianna? The crew think it\u2019s the Principality, that they\u2019ve finally decided to give us something more than a few scraps, but don\u2019t want to provoke a crusade. But that\u2019s not it, is it?\u201d He leaned forward, resting his hands on her desk. \u201cWho did you meet?\u201d", "\u201cCareful,\u201d Adrianna warned, leaning back in her chair. The form-fitting material shifted, perfectly supporting her.", "Lucas shook his head. \u201cGod damn it, Adrianna. Enough with this secrets bullshit. You like to play it close to your chest. Fine. But I\u2019ve been with you for how long? Since you came into the Cursed Red Gauntlets and you were azea haal, Vuld\u2019s favourite-\u201d", "She was out of chair faster than it took a human heart to beat, every muscle tensed and her fists clenched. Lucas realized he\u2019d crossed a line. One of the worst to cross, in fact. She put up with that nickname from other Unbound and those who didn\u2019t know any better. It had served her in the beginning, but no one in the Red Hand had called her azea haal in years. Now and forevermore, she was the Red Queen. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have \u2013 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d", "Her nostrils flared, her blue eyes flashed... and then her features softened and she sat back down. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know,\u201d she said at last. \u201cThat\u2019s not me being coy. You don\u2019t want to know.\u201d She liked Harker. As he said, they\u2019d known each other since she\u2019d been initiated into the Cursed Red Gauntlets. He was an old freighter hand turned smuggler than pirate. He didn\u2019t believe in the cause as much as she or many of the recruits did; he knew that humans and many other species got a raw deal in the Compact, but to him that was just the way things were. You did what you could with the hand you were dealt, and that was all. \u2018No point trying to change the deck\u2019, he\u2019d told her once.", "Backwash was a hell of a drink. At least, to humans. Other species thought it was cheap rotgut. Tribunes barely noticed it. Shimmers and Steersmen took to it. For most other species, all it had going for it was that was inexpensive and easy to brew. Almost every Unbound ship or station had at least one still and hence, plenty of backwash. Lucas always knew how to pick out the good stuff, though. Relatively speaking.", "He\u2019d brought her this bottle as a celebration. The Odegan Independence League had accepted the Red Hand\u2019s offers of alliance. Truthfully, it wasn\u2019t much to celebrate. The League was the most organized point of political opposition to the Compact on Odega, but even they had never done anything more than wave placards and march through a few streets. A few of the League\u2019s most daring members had actually committed acts of vandalism against CST vehicles and buildings. There were a handful of firebrands in there, though. They just needed to be encouraged and if there was one thing that Adrianna had gotten good at, it was motivating people. Give her a few weeks and she\u2019d have protests turning to riots. The CST would turn up the heat on the Odegans. They\u2019d either knuckle under, or push back and when they did...", "\u201cBunch of dumb kids,\u201d Lucas said as he poured himself another drink. He\u2019d had more than his fair share. Adrianna had had enough to be polite, but she wasn\u2019t drunk. She\u2019d never been drunk before she\u2019d been rebuilt and with her implants, now she never would be. She\u2019d learned to fake it, though. People were surprisingly open when they were drinking with you, or assumed you were plastered. It also put them at ease, made it easier to forget that she wasn\u2019t quite like them any more \u201cDon\u2019t know what they\u2019re in for.\u201d", "\u201cThe first steps towards the liberation of their world,\u201d Adrianna said with theatrical pomposity, but Lucas wasn\u2019t in the mood. He glared at her.", "\u201cDon\u2019t hand me that shit,\u201d he\u2019d grunted. \u201cThey\u2019re in for a short, shitty life and you know it. The CST\u2019ll step on them hard and fast.\u201d", "\u201cAnd we\u2019ll step on them,\u201d she replied.", "\u201cYeah, I suppose we will. Then the real soldiers come out, not Commish bully-boys paid by the cracked head, Adri. I\u2019m talking about Ground Force regulars, Janissaries, maybe even the Blackened. You remember those fuckers, right? We going to fight a war for a bunch of teat-sucking kids, Adri?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d she replied softly. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not, Lucky. They\u2019ll die. It\u2019ll be a massacre... but I\u2019ll make it a massacre that everyone sees.\u201d", "\u201cWhy? So y\u2019 can scare \u2018em back into their holes?\u201d", "\u201cNo, so I can make them angry. The Compact likes quashing dissent, but they like it clean when they present it. Rubble that used to be a building. A few bandaged \u2018terrorists\u2019 getting taken in and the rest are just names and pictures on a screen. Neat and tidy and all wrapped up for everyone to see and learn from. \u2018You can\u2019t stop us. We\u2019ll take care of you just like these people.\u2019", "\u201cThey don\u2019t want their sheltered elites to see some stupid college student cut in half by flechettes or a bunch of downtrodden labourers getting nerve-gassed. They don\u2019t want anyone to see the shadows of people that rad-bombs leave behind, or the bits and pieces of dissenters strewn across plazas and parks.\u201d Adrianna was running her finger along the rim of her glass, her voice taking on an edge of fervour.", "Lucas snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re willing to throw all those lives away for that? Fucking Triarch\u2019s blood, Adri.\u201d", "The woman looked over at him. \u201cYes, Lucky,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir lives. Our lives. My life. For the cause. It\u2019s not pretty, it\u2019s not easy. Maybe I can turn the Odegans into something more than a handful of dissatisfied helots and fashionably rebellious teens. Maybe all I\u2019ll get from them is riots and \u2018Remember Odega\u2019 banners waved on other worlds. I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m going to do everything I can for them, for everyone else and for the cause.\u201d", "\u201c\u2018For the cause\u2019,\u201d Lucas repeated, staring into his glass. \u201cYou really believe that, don\u2019t you?\u201d", "Adrianna\u2019s expression went blank. \u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re a good kid, Adri,\u201d he said. Her father was the only other person who\u2019d called her \u2018kid\u2019. \u201cBut this liberation and freedom horseshit... I always thought it was horseshit, you know? Just a way to bring in dewey-eyed recruits and fill up crew slots. I went along with it because, why not? You\u2019re a good kid. Better commander than Vuld ever was. But this business in the Canyon. You\u2019re poking the hornet\u2019s nest. A lot of people are going to die.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThey will. And more after them. And more after them.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019ll never stop.\u201d", "\u201cNo. Not until we\u2019re free.\u201d", "Lucas laughed. \u201cFree? There\u2019s no free here. We have our roles assigned. We do what we do and that\u2019s all we do.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d Adrianna insisted. \u201cThere is. A universe where we don\u2019t have to be under the thumb of the Compact. Where we don\u2019t have to send our people out to fight their wars. Where we aren\u2019t told that we\u2019re inferior. That we\u2019re stupid, clumsy Broken with \u2018functional minds\u2019. We can chart our own destiny, away from the Triarchs and their hired thugs. Every single \u2018client race\u2019 has that right. That\u2019s what I believe \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting for.\u201d", "\u201cYou get these kids following you because they don\u2019t know what freedom really means,\u201d Lucas said, gulping down another mouthful of liquor. \u201cFreedom means starving because food isn\u2019t shipped in from off-world. It means plague because there\u2019s no medicine. It means crashing economies because there\u2019s no more industry. It means war and a return to the bad old days for us. You remember those, don\u2019t you? We almost went extinct.\u201d The older man shook his head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want that for anyone back on Rally, no matter how sanctimonious those pricks can be.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019d rather be a slave than-\u201d she regretted the words as they left her mouth and cut herself off. This was supposed to be a friendly get-together.", "He looked at her, almost sadly. \u201cI\u2019d rather be alive, Adri. Me and everyone else. I did my time, did my service. I worked in Rally\u2019s merchant marine, goin\u2019 from world to world. Trading, selling, buying. I heard the whispers, the jokes, the sneers. \u2018s just words. \u2018S just the way it is. Can\u2019t change it and fightin\u2019 it only gets you and everyone next to you dead.\u201d", "\u201cThen what do you think we should do?\u201d", "\u201cPlay the game, long as we can and for as much as we can,\u201d he told her. \u201cWe\u2019re all dealt one hand and we can\u2019t ever change it. That\u2019s all. No point trying to change the deck. Sooner or later...\u201d he shrugged. \u201cThe house always wins.\u201d", "\u201cThen why bother?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy stick with me when all I\u2019m going to do is lose?\u201d", "He put his hand on her shoulder. By now, he was so drunk that it took him a couple tries. \u201cBecause, kid,\u201d he said. \u201cI may not believe in this cause, but I believe in you.\u201d", "When he\u2019d sobered up, he hadn\u2019t remembered anything of their conversation. Lucas was a good officer, better than many of the self-styled \u2018superior\u2019 non-humans in the Red Hand\u2019s ranks and like he said, he\u2019d been with her from the start. He wasn\u2019t much for bloodshed or tactics, but Adrianna didn\u2019t need that. Harker was a good administrator and knew how to organize fleet dispositions, assignments and duty rosters quickly and capably. He also didn\u2019t buy into the messiah complex many of the more idealistic recruits ascribed to her. Whenever she built up too much of a head of steam, she could always count on him for a cold splash of water. But he was a product of the Compact. He bought into the system, even if he lived outside it. He wasn\u2019t \u2013 he\u2019d never be \u2013 ready to know about Nemesis and Red One.", "\u201cOkay,\u201d Lucas said, sitting down in her chair. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know. But is there anything that I might want to? Might even need to?\u201d", "\u201cI was going to call a general assembly of all ship leaders when we got back to Minos Perch. I didn\u2019t want to look like I was playing favourites, but you\u2019re right. You\u2019ve been with me the longest and you\u2019ve been there for me since the beginning. You deserve more.\u201d Adrianna gestured to the empty seat across from her. \u201cSit. I\u2019ll tell you about the shape of things to come.\u201d", "Lucas arched an eyebrow. \u201cWith a little less drama?\u201d He grinned slightly.", "Adrianna smiled back. \u201cWith a little less drama.\u201d", "~", "Minos Perch\u2019s main war room was filled with Adrianna\u2019s seniormost leaders. She\u2019d summoned all her ships back from their operations for this meeting, ordering a full communications blackout. There had been some grumbling, mostly from the more piratical officers in her contingent, but they had obeyed. Outside of the vassa anka, discipline in the Red Hand was not quite up to military spec \u2013 but it was head and shoulders above almost any other Unbound cartel. Partly because her leaders had learned to trust her judgment and partly because they knew what happened to anyone who disobeyed the Red Queen without a very good reason.", "Over two dozen different species were represented here, all of them bragging, chatting, flirting, talking. Lucas waited at the head of the room; at one point it had been a general meeting room for the asteroid\u2019s miners, technicians and administrators. Slate-grey walls had been livened up with a handful of paintings \u2018collected\u2019 by various Red Hand troopers, the styles running from abstract cubism to vivid neo-realism.", "As ever, Adrianna was on-time for the meeting, her armsmen trailing behind her. Lucas had noted that fewer and fewer of the Red Hand\u2019s own leaders took to making their subordinates wait these days. The Red Queen took her place at the speaker\u2019s podium, one of her bodyguards standing behind her. Jhan moved the back of the room, where the Tribune could watch the assembled Unbound from a different angle. Everyone except for Lucas, Adrianna and her bodyguards had been stripped of their weapons in a \u2018random security screening\u2019. There was the usual grumbling about the queen\u2019s trust issues, but given that seven weeks ago one of Adrianna\u2019s subordinates had led a briefing where an argument between attendees had resulted in drawn weapons and two bullets in someone\u2019s torso, it was relatively restrained. Leblanc was not above ensuring that certain lessons sunk in.", "\u201cThank you all for coming so quickly,\u201d Adrianna began. \u201cI know many of you had ongoing operations that you had to cut short. I\u2019ll make this as quick as possible so you can return to them. You\u2019ve heard the rumours by now. That we\u2019ve received a care package from some mysterious benefactor. While I won\u2019t be divulging the identity of our new associates, I felt you should all share in the good news and be informed of changes in our strategy. I\u2019ll be meeting with some of you over the next few days to go over your amended orders of battle and others in the coming weeks and months as things shake out.", "\u201cThat\u2019s the general overview. Here\u2019s what you really want to hear: aside from the hardware we looted during Six Days, we have access to new types of munitions and supplies, thanks to our associates. We\u2019ll be slowly phasing these upgrades to all blooded Red Hand ships, starting with the vassa anka. It won\u2019t be quick \u2013 these will have be homegrown since we\u2019re not getting supply runs \u2013 and we have to make sure we\u2019ve got quality before starting mass production. But for those of you who\u2019ve proven yourselves \u2013 you can look forward to getting something special to play with.\u201d", "There was a rumble of approval at this.", "\u201cSince we don\u2019t bankrupt ourselves, we\u2019ll be expanding our hunting operations. I know some of you have been pushing for this and some of you have been worried that we\u2019ll be spreading ourselves too thin. Until now, that was a very real danger.", "Some of the intel we were passed indicates several weaknesses in cartels outside the Canyon. In particular, the Severed Dreams have gone through a recent bit of misfortune. They\u2019ve been trying to cover it up, but their commanders and major fleet assets were wiped out by an Compact anti-piracy initiative and what\u2019s left of their void-based and groundside operations are leaderless and disjointed. Leader Iivass,\u201d Adrianna looked over at the Prelate, the Xensiri woman\u2019s cracked-gemstone eyes staring blankly at her.", "\u201cYou\u2019ll take Strike Team Blue to Blackbag. I sent a courier ahead to Emmet\u2019ej. The Viral Lord will be expecting you and have personnel waiting. You\u2019ll take them outside the Canyon to Vien Sector and... negotiate with what\u2019s left of the Severed Dream. We will be taking control of their networks and assets. Any who want to join us as, can. If they resist \u2013 wipe them out. You\u2019ll be going in as the muscle to make sure the takeover goes well. The Memetic Virus have experience in rebuilding and streamlining smuggling lines, so they\u2019ll take lead on that front. Watch them, learn from them. Don\u2019t let them renegotiate terms. They get what I\u2019ve offered and I need to be impressed before they get anything else. You\u2019ll also be making a statement to the rest of the cartels in Vien Sector. Make sure that they realize that we are not to be fucked with. Find a way to make an example.\u201d", "Iivass grinned toothily, approving of commander\u2019s bloody-mindedness.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve acquired a lot of financial data and interesting political tidbits,\u201d Adrianna continued. \u201cSome we can use for the coffers, some we\u2019re going to leak to the media and to our on-planet cells. I foresee a lot of embarrassed resignations and public apologies in the coming months.\u201d There were a few dark chuckles at this. \u201cWe\u2019ll be using the opportunity to move the people we\u2019ve groomed or co-opted into a lot of vacant seats. We\u2019ll help bury the naughty things they\u2019ve been doing to make them even more indebted to us. Once they\u2019re in place, we\u2019ll... advocate for a measure of understanding in both our military and our political operations. They\u2019ll ease off and our groundside operations will have an easier time. That breathing room will make the other cartels a little happier with us and that\u2019s never a bad thing.", "\u201cYou all know what to expect, what to do. Show initiative where you can. Hit the systems that try to crack down on our political allies harder, make it look like they\u2019re not accomplishing anything with all their feel-good laws and security measures. Ease up on territories that are taking a lighter approach to the demonstrators, but don\u2019t be too light on your treads.\u201d Adrianna saw a few gestures of understanding in the crowd, a few more expressions of indifference. The political wing of the Red Hand was, at the moment, a collection of loosely-aligned ideological parties. Most, like the Odegan Independence League, were informal, but a few actually had standing and representation in their respective systems. The Red Hand reached out to these organizations, supplying funding and assisting in networking. Some were radicalized and folded into the military wing of the cartel, others remained pacifistic, specifically so that they could denounce the acts of violence and pull ahead in public perception. Adrianna was always very careful to make sure that no trace of \u2018azea haal\u2019 could be found in her legitimate businesses and fronts. She was interested in ousting the Compact, not just turning the Magnameric Canyon red. The more embers there were, the more chance that the fire would catch.", "Her pirates and mercenaries complained about the money she shunted into these organizations, but never too loudly. They were making money here; more of it than they would than most other cartels... they just wanted even more. It was a tightrope, having to balance the needs of her cut-throats, the needs of her forces and the needs of the revolution. So far she was keeping her balance.", "\u201cI wanted to bring you all up to date and let you know what to expect. I also wanted to stress that this information is not to circulate beyond this group here. I understand that there will be some leakage, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m happy about it. Security is our watchword now... especially since the information we acquired contained a list of Compact informants in the Red Hand and beyond. We\u2019ll be contacting the other cartels about this. For a... gesture of friendship,\u201d more low, rough laughter \u2013 the term was a common one in the fringe. It was payment for services rendered between two normally unfriendly factions. \u201cWe\u2019ll be providing them with the names of their tattlers. I don\u2019t care what they do with them at that point.\u201d", "A hand came up, Group Leader Ar\u2019makata. When Adrianna\u2019s gaze turned on him, the slab-muscled officer spoke up. \u201cYou said the Red Hand was compromised,\u201d the Worker said. \u201cWho are the traitors?\u201d Gazes shifted sideways as men, women and other-gendered beings looked suspiciously at their compatriots.", "Adrianna smiled. She could always trust someone to ask the obvious question. \u201cThere are four. You needn\u2019t worry about three of them; they are known to me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve only ever been reporting what I wanted them to and the personnel I have watching them have done an excellent job in managing these individuals and their networks. They\u2019re not even here tonight. The fourth, though...\u201d She trailed off. \u201cIs here.\u201d", "Another flurry of sideways glances.", "\u201cSomeone in this room received seven payments of c10,000 over the last three years,\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cThose payments were deposited in secret bank accounts, made by a series of shell corporations that were traced back to the CST\u2019s intelligence branch. Contact between this person and known associates of CST intelligence was logged on three separate occasions. Further, while you\u2019ve been on Minos Perch, I had the individual\u2019s quarters on their ship searched. Hidden partitions on their personal computer drive were found with highly classified data on our operations and CMA code buried in the system to implicate other, loyal officers. It appears that this individual was feeding our operational data to the Compact for months and was planning on sending Minos Perch\u2019s location to Local Command. I am not happy.\u201d", "Those last four words were like a physical shock. The last time their queen had said them, she had been addressing those who\u2019d betrayed her on Unicorn Set.", "There were five of them. Hands tied behind their backs, they\u2019d been forced to kneel in front of her and behind each of them was one of her few remaining trusted soldiers, weapon drawn. The room was filled with as many of the rest of the Red Hand could fit in. The traitors were bloodied and bruised. Some had been in captivity for months, waiting until all of them could be brought together.", "Adrianna didn\u2019t know what made her angrier; that there were so many, or this little cabal had been all it took to kill thousands of people. Three of them had run the instant she\u2019d set sail for her new base and the trap they\u2019d arranged. The other two had remained inside the Red Hand, ready and willing to continue their treachery under a new master. Or maybe they\u2019d planned to take power for themselves. Adrianna didn\u2019t care. She\u2019d found them all, no matter how far or fast they\u2019d run and her people had been given specific instructions: I want them alive.", "That was one of the grandiose, too-clever-by-half rules she swore she\u2019d never follow, but this was a special case. The Red Hand was almost dead on its feet. The remaining men and women were the ones she trusted the least. She needed to make them understand that she was not someone to cross, that there was no easy death after committing treachery. A knife across the throat, a shot in the back \u2013 those were simple, clean executions. She needed a statement.", "It began with three words.", "\u201cYou betrayed me,\u201d she said.", "One of them opened her mouth to speak, but Adrianna pre-empted whatever excuse the other woman was going to make. She gestured with one forefinger and the guard standing behind the traitor clubbed her with the butt of his pistol. The woman fell forward with a cry. \u201cYou don\u2019t speak right now,\u201d Adrianna told them. \u201cYou betrayed me. You betrayed the Red Hand. You betrayed your brothers and sisters in arms. I don\u2019t care why you did it. Some of you did it for money; I would have made you rich. Some did it because the Compact extorted you, pressured your families; I would have helped you. Some wanted to climb the ranks; if you\u2019d shown skill, I would have promoted you. Some of you did it because you just didn\u2019t like me; you should have just fucking left. Each of you had your reasons. None of them matter. You betrayed thousands of my people to death. Because of you, we lost ships, money and infrastructure. You\u2019ve set us back years. Your masters must be very pleased, very happy.", "Adrianna\u2019s expression was hooded and dark. \u201cI, however.... I am not happy.\u201d", "She paused. \u201cI thought very long about how you were going to die. A bullet to the back of the head? Too simple. Hand you over to the crew, let them get some measure of revenge for all the comrades you lost? Too impersonal. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t even kill you. I should leave you as you left me. Buried alive. Bleeding and broken in the dark. Somewhere that you could scream for help all you wanted but no one would ever come for you.\u201d The pirate queen looked over at her captives. \u201cThat was tempting. It still is. But I made my decision. You can never pay the blood debt you owe, but this will be some small measure of atonement for your sins.\u201d", "Adrianna crouched in front of the leader, Hnan. He was glaring at her with utter contempt, but she could see the fear in each of his four eyes. \u201cAs the Compact likes to remind us, my people are not civilized like you,\u201d she said, lowering her voice so that her audience had to strain to hear her. \u201cWe are primitive, superstitious beings. Some of us even still believe in, and pray to a deity. Can you imagine?\u201d She ran her tongue over her lips and leaned in. \u201cDo you know what crucifixion is?\u201d", "Hnan lunged at her, but his guard shoved him to the ground, pushing the barrel of his gun into the Tribune\u2019s head. Adrianna didn\u2019t move an inch. She straightened slowly, nodding to someone in the crowd. The captives turned, mouths agape as a pair of Red Hand ratings came forward, one of them carrying five EVA suits.... and the other had in each hand, a meter-long hull rivet.", "\u201cThey say that you can\u2019t look directly into shockspace,\u201d the human said idly. \u201cThat it\u2019s inherently incomprehensible to an organic mind.... but the thing is, the brain keeps trying. It keeps trying to force it to make sense and it can\u2019t. It just can\u2019t. But it just keeps on trying until it destroys itself in the attempt. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. It\u2019s probably just an old spacer\u2019s tale... but you five are going to find out.\u201d", "She touched her wrist, right above the tarsal bones. \u201cAn important thing to remember is that the stakes go through here. You see, they\u2019re often depicted as being put through the palms, but you put them through there, the weight of your body tears them out, right through your hands. If that happens, you might come loose.\u201d She laughed. \u201cAnd that would just be embarrassing, to go through all that trouble to get up on the hull and then \u2013 whoops! \u2013 you just slide right off.\u201d She looked into five sets of horrified, angry eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, though. The suits will seal around the breach, so you don\u2019t have to worry about decompression killing you. You\u2019ll stay out there for days, screaming at nothing until your minds shatter. And,\u201d she laughed again, even darker than before. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing... everyone who sees this ship from now on... they\u2019ll remember what happens to people that turn on me. The next time someone comes to them with an offer, they\u2019re going to think back to this moment. They\u2019ll remember that I survived. That I found each and every one of the last set of people who betrayed me and then I made them atone for what they did.\u201d She smiled thinly, like a knife\u2019s edge. \u201cNow you can speak.\u201d", "Ignoring the threats, imprecations, apologies and pleas for mercy, the Red Queen turned from her captives to her crew. \u201cTake them.\u201d", "Still sobbing and screaming, the five traitors were dragged away.", "The room suddenly got very quiet as their queen\u2019s gaze drifted across each officer, her fingers brushing along the leather strap holding her pistol in its holster. She didn\u2019t need augmented senses to pick out the increase in tension. When she finally spoke, at least one heart skipped a beat.", "\u201cSabisca.\u201d", "All eyes turned towards the woman whose name Adrianna had just spoken. Leader Sabisca Can-dai. The Yttrian stood on shaking legs, those sitting next to her moving away. They didn\u2019t even try to be subtle about it.", "When Adrianna spoke again, her voice was soft and almost gentle. \u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cI... I needed the money. I\u2019m sorry, please.. I-I needed-\u201d", "Adrianna snapped her fingers. The pirate queen had never seen a Tribune move as quickly or as quietly as Jahn and the armsman was suddenly behind Can-dai. In one swift movement, he swept a clear bag over her head, pulling it tight as he hauled her up off the ground. She was almost a hundred and seventy pounds and the Tribune hoisted her like she weighed nothing at all. Sabisca shouted and kicked, clawing at Jahn\u2019s arms, but his skin was too thick for her claws to do much more then scratch. The armsman was grinning darkly as the Yttrian thrashed in his grip, unable break free and rapidly running out of oxygen.", "\u201cI dislike being lied to,\u201d Adrianna said to the struggling Didact. \u201cI like it even less when it\u2019s done with disrespect. You did not \u2018need the money\u2019. You are Pack Leader Ginhara Ol-ema of the Compact Intelligence Services. Sabisca is a construct. Her family does not exist. Her ailing mother, for whom she needs large sums of money for expensive treatment, is a fiction. It was a good cover; I commend you. You played the role well. I was completely taken in by the depth of your performance. But the stage lights are going out, Ginhara. The orchestra has retired, the audience is anxious to return home and the play is over. It\u2019s time for you to take your last bow.\u201d", "Ginhara was trying to speak, but whether to plea for her life or curse Adrianna was immaterial \u2013 she could barely breathe now, the inside of the bag fogged with her last, desperate gasps for air. Finally, her reddened eyes glazed over and she went limp. Jahn held her there for several moments longer, then let go. The Yttrian\u2019s body fell bonelessly to the ground, blank eyes staring at nothing, a swollen tongue hanging from her mouth.", "\u201cThere was no Sabisca Can-dai,\u201d Adrianna informed her subordinates. \u201cGroup Leader Korvak; you are now and always have been Nightbloom\u2019s leader. If your crew inquires about such a person, inform them that they must be mistaken. Neither you, nor any of the people here, know of such a person because there is, was and never has been anyone with that name here.\u201d The Steersman bobbed his head in an approximation of a human nod.", "Adrianna didn\u2019t spare another glance at the pack leader\u2019s body. \u201cA new age is coming for us, for the Magnameric Canyon and for everyone under the Compact\u2019s boot. It won\u2019t be easily forged. It won\u2019t be quick. It will be painful. It will be hard. It will be bloody. A lot of people will die and many of you will be among them. I don\u2019t begrudge those who walk away. I do take issue with treachery and betrayal. Each of you will at some point ask yourselves if this is the path you want. Choose wisely.", "\u201cThose who fight with us will be rewarded, whether they desire riches, power or the simple right of freedom that all sapient beings deserve. Those who choose to stand against us won\u2019t even be remembered.\u201d", "There was a prolonged silence in the chamber and then one of the younger officers stood. He was from the Magnameric Canyon, one of the firebrands who\u2019d grown tired of the Compact\u2019s iron rule. \u201cForgive me, matron... but you make it sound like we\u2019re going to war.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019ve always been at war, Dromos,\u201d Adrianna replied. \u201cBut now...\u201d she smiled and the fire in her eyes was brighter than ever. \u201cNemesis rises... and fate is with us.\u201d"]}

Instead of the direct hits the cruiser was hoping for, it scored only a handful of glancing strikes on the Red Hand\u2019s sigil ship. \u201cAll batteries, lock onto Speartip and return fire!\u201d", "The heavy cruiser\u2019s guns volleyed back, but the Compact cruiser accelerated wildly, lunging out of the larger ship\u2019s arc and Naamah did no more damage to its target then Speartip had. No matter; there were many other targets for their guns.", "\u201cThe Knife Eaters have broken formation,\u201d Group Leader Delauz reported, the Prelate snapping his fanged mouth. \u201cThey are retreating.

They want us.\u201d Yuki-Onna went dark as the corvette was holed amidships by a railgun fusillade. That was the last of her corvette strength. Lamashtu and Empusa had been destroyed screening Naamah from the worst of the attack. Rakshasi was, like the rest of her fleet, running as fast it could, but unlike the cutters, bulk cruisers and modified raiders that made up the Red Hand\u2019s void force, the Compact was pursuing it. Like Naamah, Rakshasi was a ship she\u2019d taken from them and they wanted it back. Luckily, it looked like Kuumal had enough of a lead to outpace his pursuers. That was something.", "Fifty six.", "That was how many warships the Compact had diverted here. Nothing larger than the battlecruiser Adjucator\u2019s Resolve, but to a pirate fleet, it might as well have been a wall of Chariots. They\u2019d been waiting for her. She\u2019d flown right into an trap.", "She felt like laughing.", "~", "The Karkan sky was an ugly bronze as Adrianna walked across the killing field.", "His name was Jason Gersham, an Advocate, Submissive. Cabal Squad, Seventh Platoon, 1118th Volunteers. He was laying on his back, unable to move. His spine was broken. So were his arms and legs. Even his ribs were shattered. Ground Force armour wasn\u2019t the equal of Janissary or Blackened powered armour and he\u2019d been caught in the periphery of a blast that had killed the rest of his squad, hurled like a doll across Karkan\u2019s broken ground.", "All around her, Adrianna heard the whimpers and cries of the rest of Seventh Platoon\u2019s dying. Anyone who could run already had. It was a familiar sound to her now; from dozens of different species across hundreds of worlds, it was all the same. Some cursed, some begged, some prayed to their gods, others called out for their mothers, their lovers, their children. This was the aftermath that she always made herself see. This time she didn\u2019t find any enjoyment in it.", "Seventh Platoon had expected an easy mission, a raid on a dissident safehouse where weapons were being stored. It was supposed to be a photo op for the newest units in the 1118th Volunteers. Rebels being led away in handcuffs or taken away in body bags, pictures of the human Ground Force soldiers standing over confiscated weapons and anti-Compact literature. They hadn\u2019t known that the intelligence coup was one that Adrianna let them have. Oh, Karkan\u2019s resistance was unbelievably sloppy and planetary intelligence had identified the safehouse legitimately. Adrianna had known that they\u2019d known, though. She\u2019d considered simply evacuating the facility, but the opportunity to ambush the Compact had been too good to pass up. She hadn\u2019t expected the 1118th to be ordered in, though. Maybe the Compact\u2019s leaders had thought it a good way to blood Seventh Platoon \u2013 a simple rollover of lightly-armed rebels. Or maybe they\u2019d suspected what she was doing and sent in the humans as cannon fodder, or maybe hoping that she would have held off against her people.", "Instead, she was sending an entirely different message than the one she\u2019d planned to. She knelt next to the advocate, submissive. He\u2019d been the highest-ranking survivor left when he\u2019d followed command\u2019s orders and advanced into the teeth of her guns. If it had just been the Karkan rebels, the audacity of the attack would have carried Gersham and his three fragmented squads through. It hadn\u2019t been just them. \u201cYou\u2019re dying,\u201d she said without preamble.", "Gersham burbled something, blood and froth spattering over his lips as he tried to speak. Maybe he wanted to curse her, maybe he wanted to beg for his life \u2013 she couldn\u2019t tell. She couldn\u2019t have saved him anyways. The only entity in the universe that might have been able to was thousands of light years away. Instead, the young man was going to drown in his own blood. That was a bad way to go. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have been here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt should have been someone else.\u201d", "She leaned over Jason, putting one hand on the back of his head.

Just enough that he could look past the sickly orange sky, to the horizon where one of Karkan\u2019s storms was drifting over the distant mountains of the Lost Footsteps. Towering cumulonimbus clouds rose into the thin atmosphere, filled with dust and sediment and lit from the inside with flashes of lightning. Forked tongues of electricity licked down from each cloud, roiling spalls of ball lightning illuminating the distant sky. \u201cLook,\u201d Adrianna said softly. \u201cOne of the few beautiful things on this world. Look at that.\u201d Her voice lowered. \u201cTake that with you.\u201d", "He made a sound, wet and ragged as he tried to breathe from lungs rapidly filling with blood. Adrianna didn\u2019t even know if he was aware of any of this. With her free hand, she drew her khopesh and thumbed the activation button. The disruption field crackled to life, arcing over the blade. \u201cTake everything beautiful with you,\u201d she told him. In one smooth movement she drove the khopesh through the young man\u2019s backplate. It came out his chest, but he never saw it. His last sight was of Karkan\u2019s small perfections.", "\u201cThere,\u201d Adrianna said as she laid the submissive back on the ground. \u201cNow you know.\u201d She wasn\u2019t talking to him, but to his superiors who would review the footage his helmet cam was recording. \u201cAnyone you send after me will die. I will kill them and I will keep killing until the Canyon is free of your stink. Until every serf in the sector is free of you. Until every \u2018uncivilized\u2019 being knows of your towering hypocrisy. Until your cities are in flames and you can no longer hide from every atrocity you\u2019ve committed.\u201d", "The woman touched Gersham\u2019s face. \u201cHe died because you were cowards,\u201d she continued, never once raising her voice. \u201cBecause you sent children after me. You sat in your bunkers and your barracks, shitting yourselves in fear and sending raw recruits out for your battles. Did you think I wouldn\u2019t fight? No, you knew. You knew and you didn\u2019t care. You wanted to see \u2018Broken\u2019 killing each other. Fine. I\u2019m giving you this one as a gift. I hope you enjoyed it, because it will be the last pleasure you have. I\u2019m going to take everything from you. I\u2019m going to dig you out of the holes you cower in, pull you into the light of day and lay all your sins at your feet.\u201d Adrianna stood. \u201cLike I said, I hope you enjoyed the show.\u201d", "That evening\u2019s news on Karkan was headlined by the sacrifice Seventh Platoon made in attacking a rebel stronghold, diverting dissident forces away from several other bases of operations that were struck by planetary police, CST enforcers and military. The cowardly nature of the rebels, their complete disregard for society, the damage that they were doing to the image of their fellow species, their ruthlessness in executing the wounded was played up for maximum salaciousness. Many talking heads opined that this kind of wanton brutality and reflexive aggression against authority simply proved the barbarity of the lower species and how infectious dangerous rhetoric could be, even duping or drawing in the weaker-willed members of more civilized races. Citizens were urged to be on guard for potentially disloyal acts or sentiments and reminded that such vigilance was the price that the Compact paid as they attempted to guide less civilized beings away from such aggression.", "Contrasting this punditry was the courage and valour of Seventh Platoon. Jason Gersham was memorialized as a hero who\u2019d taken command of the tattered remnants of the platoon and led them on a charge against the enemy positions, driving the dissidents from their holes and routing them but dying in the doing. Dead martyrs played better than live heroes, after all. The latter might have commented on such things as \u2018insufficient support\u2019 and \u2018faulty intelligence\u2019. As it was, none of the survivors of Seventh Platoon were in a position to counter the official story and if any felt inclined to do so, then it was simply a matter of pointing out that doing so would dishonour the memory of their fallen comrades.", "The deaths of so many humans was fed into the media\u2019s propaganda mill as a reminder that younger races had the potential for greatness in them and that by following the guidance of their betters, they could achieve much. That those who followed the Compact were a beacon for others to follow and if they died in their duty, then they would remain an example for all to see and follow. Those like the dissidents who lashed out against the society that fed, clothed and nurtured them fought only for their own selfish desires. They were unstable, failing to properly assimilate and rather than redress such failings, blamed those around them for it.", "No mention was made of the Red Hand\u2019s presence, nor of the futile manhunt Karkan authorities performed in an attempt to locate the \u2018red queen\u2019 and her fellow terrorists. It would disrupt the narrative.", "~", "Naamah shuddered as another missile struck home, wiping away one of her point defence batteries. The heavy cruiser\u2019s shields had collapsed and the Compact fleet was moving in, picking at the wounded heavy cruiser with surgical precision. She\u2019d surprised them with her new missiles. Not enough to even the odds, not remotely \u2013 but enough to bleed them more than they\u2019d expected. Even now, Naamah was still fighting back; she\u2019d sent another destroyer to Hell and was setting her teeth in one of the enemy cruisers, firing on it relentlessly, even as its comrades moved in for the kill.", "Twelve different capital ships were firing on Naamah; if they\u2019d wanted to, they could have easily and utterly destroyed the warship, but that wasn\u2019t the plan, was it? They wanted the ship intact. They wanted its databanks, they wanted her. That was why they cared so little about the rest of Adrianna\u2019s retreating fleet. Better to make sure they took the Red Queen then try for every possible ship and have even the smallest chance that she\u2019d slip through their fingers. Once she was gone, there would be a power struggle for control of the Red Hand, between her fellow rebels and the pirates and mercenaries.", "And, of course, the Compact wanted witnesses to her defeat... to have every surviving Red Hand spread the tale of how their \u2018infallible\u2019 leader had been brought down. Much as she hated it, she was the heart of the organization. Some loved her, some feared her, some followed her for the cause, others for the blood they could spill, but she was a fixed point for each of them: the Red Queen. The woman that the Compact couldn\u2019t kill. They\u2019d tried time and again over the years and each time she had survived. They couldn\u2019t just destroy her ship \u2013 without a body to parade around, there\u2019d always be that question of whether she survived. They needed to kill not just her, but the myth of her.", "It looked like they just might do it this time.", "Adrianna snapped out orders as her warship and crew died around her. If this was going to be her last stand, it would be as bloody as she could make it.", "~", "\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Adrianna said by way of greeting as Lucas came into her office. She didn\u2019t move to look at him, leaning over a table as she sifted through holographic news reports. All of them were from Alhensa. He\u2019d been there until a few days ago, overseeing some minor administrative duties until the Landing Square Massacre.\u201cThis was supposed to be a peaceful rally against Tamib. He was supposed to act like the condescending piece of shit he is and we were supposed to end up with a public relations boost. Instead, we have pro-Compact rioting as everyone rallies around the flag. The System Collective has been disgraced, their leader was killed \u2018resisting arrest\u2019.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI wanted something simple and quiet.\u201d", "\u201cSomeone set off a bomb,\u201d Lucas replied, aiming for an attempt at levity.", "Leblanc looked up at him. She wasn\u2019t amused. \u201cThank you, Lucas. I wasn\u2019t aware of that.\u201d", "\u201cThe Alhensans have been pushing to be more proactive,\u201d Lucas said, reaching to adjust the table\u2019s holographic interface, bringing up field reports. \u201cIt looks like someone decided not to wait for our go-ahead.\u201d", "\u201cThe Alhensans are idiots,\u201d Adrianna growled. \u201cWe\u2019ve been restricting violence there for a reason, pushing funding into the System Collective party. Koooual had a good shot, especially with all the dirt we\u2019ve dug up on Tamib and his CST cronies.\u201d She inhaled through her nose. \u201cIt was a simple plan. Every time Tamib and his Stability Party cracks down, we push back. He\u2019s been bleeding votes and districts for years now and this election we could have gotten the Collective in as the official opposition. Maybe \u2013 just maybe! \u2013 even got Koooual the governorship.\u201d", "\u201cNot that she\u2019d thank us,\u201d Lucas observed.", "\u201cTrue, but that was the point. We get someone we like in, someone above reproach with no connection to us. Alhensa liberalizes and, magically, when they stop treating the client population as helots, they stop experiencing unrest and we stop blowing holes in their ships.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIdiots.\u201d", "\u201cWe don\u2019t know it was one of the Alhensan cells. It could have been the Compact. Tamib\u2019s administration was facing senate hearings for those backdoor deals with the CST. Now, everyone\u2019s forgotten that.\u201d", "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they did it or one of our cells went rogue,\u201d Adrianna snapped. \u201cBlame\u2019s already been assigned and someone claiming to represent the dissident movement has taken credit for it. We had a planet on the brink of regime change. Now we\u2019ve got a massive backlash in public opinion, we\u2019ve got Alhensan police, CST enforcers and Compact military wading into our cells who are screaming for the weapons we promised them.\u201d", "\u201cFuck \u2018em,\u201d Lucas said, pulling up a chair next to the table. \u201cThey went off the reservation. Let them deal with the consequences.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019d like nothing better than to cut my losses,\u201d the woman replied, running a hand through her hair. \u201cBut if we do that...\u201d", "\u201c...it will damage our credibility,\u201d Lucas finished. \u201cIf we promise aid and then withhold it when our cells actually need it, the rest are going to start to wonder if we\u2019ll do the same thing to them.\u201d He paused. \u201cAlhensa\u2019s on total lockdown, Adri. It was hard enough for me to get out of the system. Getting anything in \u2013 especially weapons \u2013 is going to be hard and it\u2019s going to cost a lot more.\u201d", "\u201cAnd our finances aren\u2019t in that great a state right now, I know.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re still making money. Even with the R&D at Minos Perch and all these little resistance cells and political parties we\u2019re propping up, we\u2019re still in the black.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re not making enough money, though. We\u2019ve got mercenaries, pirates and smugglers in our ranks. They don\u2019t like hearing that they\u2019re not going to be making credits hand over fist.\u201d Adrianna sighed, her shoulders slumping. \u201cWe\u2019re losing ground. At best, we\u2019re in a holding pattern. The Compact\u2019s good at quashing rebellions. Hell, they\u2019re good at making sure that they never happen in the first place! If the CST wasn\u2019t so monumentally corrupt, we wouldn\u2019t have a quarter of the traction we do in the Canyon.\u201d Adrianna turned away from the table. \u201cTell me the truth, Lucas: do you think I made a mistake here?\u201d", "The older man paused, thinking the answer over. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted. \u201cYou\u2019ve expanded the Red Hand faster than almost any other cartel I\u2019ve heard of and you\u2019ve kept it together. You\u2019re good in the void, Adri. You\u2019ve got an entire sector running scared of your ships. You\u2019ve been building up alliances with the other cartels and they\u2019ve fallen into line for the most part. We have the run of the sector and choice of hunting grounds. If it were just that, we\u2019d be rolling in credits. This political angle and the resistance you\u2019ve been building up? I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re getting good intel from some of these cells and made good connections through others. There\u2019s potential there, but I think you\u2019re trying to do too much too fast. I know how to keep the books and from that angle, those are money sinks. They\u2019re costing us time and resources that I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re able to spare right now. Maybe we should ease off the ground side of things for a while, just to focus on what we\u2019re good at.\u201d", "\u201cI can hit convoys and take out patrols for years and not make a single bit of difference,\u201d Adrianna replied sourly. \u201cThat\u2019s was this was about, Lucas. Making a difference. Showing the people that they don\u2019t have to lie down and accept the way things are. They don\u2019t have to be second-class citizens because some self-styled superior asshole says that they are. They don\u2019t have to nod along and keep their heads down. They can do something about it. They can change things... but you\u2019re right. It feels like I am pushing too hard. For all the good we\u2019ve done, we still haven\u2019t made much progress at all. It\u2019s costing us. Worse, I have to walk this fucking tightrope every day. I do too little and we\u2019ll lose the momentum we\u2019ve got. Too much and our cash reserves dry up.\u201d", "\u201cThe news isn\u2019t showing it all, you know.\u201d Lucas said after a quiet moment passed. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening on Alhensa.\u201d", "\u201cThey never do.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s true, but here\u2019s the thing Adri: the local cells want those weapons because they\u2019re fighting back. Governor Tamib is barricaded in the gubernatorial palace. He jumped the gun trying to arrest Koooual. When she was killed, she became an instant martyr. The news is trying to spin it so it seems the System Collective was in bed with the terrorists that set off that bomb, but people aren\u2019t buying it. When news of Koooual\u2019s death hit the air, there was a huge riot from Collective supporters and client races alike. Tamib called his buddies in the CST to suppress it. That\u2019s only led to hardening resistance. The other political parties who were in lockstep with his hardline stance on terrorism are trying to distance themselves from him now. He\u2019s scrambling to cover his ass and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen. Once the Compact at large learns that he took a prosperous, profitable world and mismanaged it to the point of widespread insurrection, they\u2019re going to make an example out of him.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s something.\u201d Adrianna stood. \u201cOkay. We\u2019ll try and get something to the Alhensan cells. After that, I\u2019ll dial down the focus on the planetary movements. We\u2019ll still work on that front, but we\u2019ll tread softer. We\u2019ll be more Mao than Guevara,\u201d she grinned at the reference only she understood. \u201cThat will give the Perch time to get our new weapons up and running. We\u2019ll shore up our interests out-sector to keep that revenue coming in. I think Vien has a few avenues that should be easy to exploit without stretching ourselves too thin.\u201d", "The older man nodded. \u201cSounds good.\u201d He paused. \u201cI know you hate having to step back, but it\u2019s the right call. If we move a little bit slower, we can shore up our networks and infrastructure. We\u2019ll keep everything on a slow burn, so we can boil it over all at once.\u201d", "\u201cI said something similar not too long ago.\u201d Adrianna looked over at the table with the Alhensan reports. \u201cThanks. I guess I need to pulled up short every once in a while.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m here for,\u201d Harker replied. \u201cThe fire rises, but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t need the occasional douse of water.\u201d", "\u201cAt the very least, Emmet\u2019ej will stop showing me those projections of how I\u2019m going to end up destroying the entire Unbound presence in the Canyon.\u201d Adrianna looked over at Harker. \u201cI have the urge to beat on someone.\u201d", "\u201cThe Grasping Sands have started to run slaving operations out of Nemoti again,\u201d Lucas suggested. \u201cIn strict contradiction of your orders.\u201d The Red Hand did a lot of questionable things, but slaving was not one of them. In fact, they were more brutal towards slavers than any legitimate government. Every Unbound clan or cartel that wanted to do business with the Red Hand had to forsake all trafficking in sapient beings. The most explanation Adrianna had ever given anyone for that was \u2018because I say so\u2019. Lucas knew her well enough that she didn\u2019t need to explain why she held such loathing for slavers, but anyone else would only ever get the first answer. \u201cWill that do?\u201d", "She smiled at him then. The familiar, hungry grin of a she-wolf. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it will.\u201d", "~", "The bait had been crafted well: a military citadel being put up right in the heart of the Red Hand\u2019s hunting grounds, an outfitting and repair station that could have armed and tended to half a dozen warships, allowing them free reign to counter the Red Hand\u2019s piracy. The information had leaked to her from \u2018reliable sources\u2019. The local Space Force had known that an unknown number of their civilian overseers were compromised by the Red Hand and they had, quite illegally, undertaken the construction, arming and development of the outpost with misappropriated funds. If it had managed to come on-line, it would have crippled her actions in a wide area and been hailed as a counter-intelligence coup. If it was destroyed, publicly... Local Command would not come off nearly as well. She hadn\u2019t had the time to clear this data with Red One \u2013 her lines of communication with Nemesis were measured in months, so she\u2019d had to act with what she had.", "A military outpost, incomplete or not was problematic for any pirate force to handle and it wouldn\u2019t be unprotected. She\u2019d gathered every ship that she had available only instead of an unfinished citadel and a handful of escorts, she found herself in a net of Compact warships, harried in-system, shedding forces as her ships were either destroyed or ran for their lives. She\u2019d taken her vassa anka and driven them towards the Compact command. They\u2019d been surprised by that; they\u2019d expected her to keep running. Even after all this time, they still underestimate me.", "Not that that would do much good right this moment, though. Naamah continued to lash out, but the warship\u2019s firepower dropped steadily as the surrounding warships continued to pick away at the heavy cruiser, carefully targeting their salvos to ensure that the vessel would be crippled, but not destroyed. She\u2019d hurt them, beating that last cruiser into a hulk and several of the attackers showed the results of her guns. They were covering each other now, one ship withdrawing as soon as its screens wavered, undamaged ships protecting its until it could restore its defences. Behind the wall of tormentors, the command ship Adjucator\u2019s Resolve lurked, safe from her guns and any attempt at a death-or-glory charge.", "The rest of the formation was moving in towards her now, too. A handful of the Compact ships were still chasing after the remains of her fleet, but that was more to discourage them from coming back than any serious attempt at interception. As she watched, a cluster of hostile red markers appeared around several of the cruisers and swarmed towards Naamah. Pinnaces and assault boats.", "\u201cAll hands,\u201d she said into the shipwide intercom. \u201cCase Killekyata. We are about to be boarded.\u201d", "~", "\u201cDamn,\u201d Adrianna glowered at the \u2018scroll in her hands. \u201cHow did we miss this?\u201d", "\u201cWe can\u2019t be everywhere,\u201d Lucas pointed out. \u201cThings slip by.\u201d He, Leblanc and a coterie of Naamah\u2019s senior officers were in the wardroom. The Red Hand had just received an extremely unpleasant bit of intelligence from one of their sources in Local Command. \u201cEspecially when it looks like Local Command intentionally cut the civilians out of the loop on this one. This was completely black-boxed, commander. They were shuffling funds earmarked for other uses around to pay for it.\u201d", "\u201cAn Ironbound Bastion-class citadel,\u201d she repeated. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything that can take one of those down.\u201d She raked fingers through her blue hair. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t our scouts or hunters reported seeing it?\u201d", "\u201cWe have noticed an increase in military movements around the Onthana system,\u201d Strategist Anto\u2019el reported. The Thoughtful\u2019s fingers drummed on the display table. \u201cNo indication of such construction was observed, although it could have been concealed. I admit that our probes in Onthana have been limited. The system is uninhabited and provides no strategic or economic benefit to the sector at large. Its only value comes from its location in our hunting grounds. Until we began to operate in the Magnameric Canyon, there was no reason to defend or safeguard Onthana. The measures to which Local Command has gone to erect this fortification suggests a measure of urgency.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re hurting them,\u201d Lucas summarized. \u201cThey need to do something to curb our operations. This is it.\u201d", "\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Adrianna growled. \u201cStationing a citadel here cuts down Compact response times dramatically. It could cripple our void operations throughout this section of the Canyon. We need those to stay up and running.\u201d", "\u201cThen we cannot allow it to be completed,\u201d Delauz affirmed, Naamah\u2019s leader growling with certitude. \u201cIt must be destroyed. Now. We have a very small window before this citadel will be operational. We must act.\u201d", "\u201cIt won\u2019t be unguarded,\u201d Anto\u2019el pointed out. \u201cAnd even partially operational, it will be difficult to destroy. It will require a substantial number of our active ships for any chance of success.\u201d", "Adrianna was silent for a moment, looking over the data. \u201cYes, it will...\u201d she mused. Her head came up. \u201cHave we got secondary confirmation on this from any other sources?\u201d", "\u201cNothing more than supporting the ship and material movements,\u201d Anto\u2019el. \u201cThe information came independently from two agents within the Space Force. They are unaware of each other and I consider both reliable. Each has provided accurate and actionable intelligence in the past.\u201d", "The Red Queen was silent for a long moment. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said to Delauz. \u201cWe can\u2019t let this citadel come on-line and we don\u2019t have the time to verify it from other channels. Have Operations dispatch a courier to Minos Perch. Bring in every ship that can get here in time. Send the rest of the vassa anka to Deconu \u2013 we\u2019ll use that as a mustering ground.\u201d", "\u201cAnd Naamah?\u201d the Prelate officer inquired. \u201cHas our queen caught a scent?\u201d", "Adrianna bit her lip. \u201cMaybe she has. Set a course for Hydra\u2019s Nest.\u201d Her eyes glittered coldly. \u201cWhy should we be the only ones planning a surprise?\u201d", "~", "It was over.", "The bitch\u2019s fleet was shattered, her leaders deserting her as they fled, putting their own lives before that of their so-called queen. Her vassa anka were wrecks and her sigil had been overrun. Resistance had been pathetically light, the ship undermanned and under-equipped. They\u2019d taken every section with ease. Ideologue Jante (and five names besides) was standing on the Unbound ship\u2019s command deck. His nostrils twitched at the metallic stench of blood. The bridge would need to be scoured clean of the taint of the Unbound before it could returned to service, obliterating all trace of its enslavement.", "The ship had been liberated, his soldiers in key positions throughout the vessel and the Red Queen was his captive. The Broken filth had killed three of his men, but now she was on her knees, holding her side where his bullet had gone through her torso. She was unable to stand, looking at him a mixture of anger, disbelief and gratifying fear.", "They\u2019d won.", "\u201cThis is how it ends,\u201d Jante hissed softly, kneeling next to the Broken and leaning over the creature\u2019s ugly face. \u201cThe fire goes out. All your gains are nothing. Your surviving fleet is running for its life, your Red Hand is shattered. Your cabals will be rooted out an destroyed. You will be paraded before an angry public and executed as a traitor to the Compact. Nothing you\u2019ve done will matter. Tell me,\u201d he growled. \u201cIs this everything you imagined?\u201d He lowered his voice further still. \u201cI had an uncle, you know. He was a Janissary, like me. Perhaps you encountered him. His name was Rynzlr.\u201d Her eyes widened fractionally and Jante put his hand on the Broken\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt is unseemly to admit, but I confess that I will take pleasure in watching them put you down like the animal you are.\u201d", "She stared at him for a moment and then started to laugh."]}

Jante narrowed his lower eyes. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d he demanded.", "\u201cYou asked...\u201d the sow wheezed. \u201cYou asked if it was everything I\u2019d imagined?\u201d She made that grating, yelping sound again. It was laughter. She had gone mad.", "\u201cYes, I did.\u201d the ideologue growled. \u201cYour fleet is gone. We have taken your ship. We have a full onslaught formation in this system. What can you possibly do against that?\u201d", "\u201cNothing,\u201d She laughed even harder. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything against that kind of firepower.\u201d She looked up at him, grinning, her small white teeth stained pink from her own blood. And just like that, the mask was gone. There was no fear, no surprise, no uncertainty. None of the trepidation and disbelief she had been wearing just moments ago remained; in its place, there was something far more predatory.", "To his credit, Jante recognized the threat, his hand going to the pistol on his hip, but he was only flesh.", "Adrianna moved. Augmented muscles flexed and he was suddenly no longer holding her. She was on her feet, driving her hand into his neck. He gagged for air and as he fell, she took his gun and opened fire. His men reacted quickly, bringing their weapons to bear in the span of heartbeats. A human would have died before she could have raised the pistol to shoot, but Adrianna hadn\u2019t been human for a very long time. She fired so quickly that it sounded like a single shot and Jante heard the heavy thuds of his soldiers\u2019 corpses hitting the deck.", "The Ideologue attempted to rise to his feet, his lungs aching as his bruised throat sucked in air, but the human came up behind him, pressing the barrel of the Janissary\u2019s own weapon against the back of his head. \u201cNo,\u201d she ordered. \u201cDon\u2019t get up.\u201d He froze where he was. \u201cMy fleet was always going to run,\u201d she told him. \u201cThose were their orders. Why would I send converted freighters and cutters up against ships of the line? That was the plan.\u201d", "\u201cA bad plan. We have taken your ship,\u201d Jante rasped, forcing a bolus of rage back down his throat. \u201cYou are one against an army.\u201d", "\u201cYou took only what I gave you,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut if it\u2019s an army you want...\u201d she tapped a comm unit. \u201cSever to Flicker. Initiate.\u201d", "A few moments passed and then Jante\u2019s own comm came to life. His people were under attack. Reports were fragmentary and confused, but it was a coordinated counter-offensive, not the desperate last-ditch attempt to retake the ship he\u2019d been expecting. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d he demanded.", "\u201cWell,\u201d Adrianna said, her voice pitched low. She was almost purring. \u201cThat\u2019s a story in itself, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", "~", "The cruiser Sederin\u2019s Boast wallowed drunkenly in space, its smooth curves and threatening bulk ruined by shattered hull plating and exposed internal structures, like the eviscerated corpse of a once-great prize fighter. Adrianna was sitting on Naamah\u2019s command, her legs crossed and fingers tented. She watched the Compact warship sputter along, the random flares of dying thrusters wobbling it back and forth. A small smile played across her lips. This wasn\u2019t the first Compact warship she\u2019d turned into a wreck, nor would it be the last.", "\u201cThe legends tell us that Sederin was a hero,\u201d Adrianna said as she stood, circling the bridge. \u201cHe was unmatched in skill and courage throughout his life and became prideful, boasting of greater and greater deeds and claiming that no one could best him, no task was beyond him. Many called it arrogance, but Sederin was tested and tested again. Each time he was victorious. Until he bragged to the wrong person at the wrong time.\u201d She paused, twirling the end of one long pigtail in her hand. \u201cI\u2019ve never understood people who name ships like this. You might as well call it the Invincible.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t humans have similar stories?\u201d Group Leader Delauz said, the reptilian Prelate carefully pronouncing each syllable. With stiff lips and inflexible tongues, the Xensiri species struggled with Compact Standard, a trait which only added to their perceived bestiality in the eyes of the more \u2018enlightened\u2019 species. Despite this, the Xensiri were extremely loyal to the Compact. A relatively recent acquisition, the Xensiri had once been mired in a truly violent civil war, which the Compact had ended when they annexed the Xensiri homeworld. Famine, disease, ethnic cleansing, a species slouching its way towards to extinction. An honest-to-God actual \u2018Cataclysm\u2019. Now, whenever anyone questioned whether client races could truly be so short-sighted as to drive themselves off a proverbial cliff, the Compact had only to point to their \u2018Prelates\u2019.", "True to their new name, the species were one of the most vocal and strident supporters of the Compact, whom they considered to be their saviours. The sickening thing was that they weren\u2019t even wrong \u2013 Adrianna had seen the original histories of the Xensiri and the Compact\u2019s own accounts. Barely anything had been changed. Prelate birth rates were among the highest of any sapient species in the galaxy \u2013 one female could lay two dozen eggs every year and the species matured quickly. They weren\u2019t as durable as Tribunes and a little too reflexively aggressive in their thinking, but they made good, loyal soldiers. Prelate regiments were often assigned to support less reliable units in battle, whether that meant shoring the discipline and morale of others, or forcing them to obey suicidal orders. It was no accident that Prelates were often shown in a positive light in Compact military fiction, often compared against humans or the other \u2018least of the unloved\u2019.", "Still, not all of the Xensiri licked the Compact\u2019s boots. There were a handful of Prelates within the Red Hand. Most of them, like Leader Iivass, Adrianna counted among her piratical element. There were a few \u2013 a very rare few \u2013 like Delauz who saw the rot inside the Compact. There had been some ruffled feather when she had chosen him, but he was a good officer and worthy of carrying her sigil when she was not aboard Naamah. \u201cYes,\u201d Adrianna replied. \u201cWe have Samson, who told his secrets to the wife that had betrayed him before. We have Achilles, who was utterly invulnerable, save a single spot that, once struck, instantly killed him.\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t name ships after them,\u201d the Xensiri observed. \u201cNot like our friends over there,\u201d he nodded towards the fading icon of Sederin\u2019s Boast.", "Adrianna said nothing. We used to. We named our vessels after the \u2018undefeatable\u2019. You\u2019d think that in thousands of years of history, we would have learned to stop doing that. \u201cScopes,\u201d she commented instead. \u201cAny movement?\u201d", "\u201cNothing, commander,\u201d Naamah\u2019s chief sensor officer reported. \u201cIf they\u2019re out there, they\u2019re keeping quiet.\u201d", "\u201cThey are,\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a scuffle between pirates and the Compact. Nothing to get involved in and risk blowing their cover. But they\u2019re watching.\u201d She circled the upper level of the heavy cruiser\u2019s bridge. This system was unimportant, a sad little planetary nebula centered around the shrunken husk of a white dwarf with a pair of uninteresting planets orbiting it; one rocky and one gaseous. If there\u2019d been any others, the star had swallowed them hundreds of thousands of years ago when it had been a red giant, starving for hydrogen fuel and ballooning outwards. Nothing interesting, nothing to draw anyone\u2019s attention. Leblanc had only come here for Sederin\u2019s Boast and the only reason that the cruiser was here was because it was on their patrol route.", "There was something else here, though. She was sure of it. She\u2019d been studying intelligence reports and there was a pattern \u2013 there had been a handful of disappearances that neither her Red Hand nor any of the other cartels were responsible for. Civilian crews, pirates and mercenaries reported seeing unknown vessel and anomalous sensor contacts. It was faint \u2013 rumours and whispers, but she was sure of it. An Askanj ghost fleet was operating in this region... and it was moving towards the Magnameric Canyon.", "Ghost fleets were the nightmare of every Compact commander and system governor. Askanj ECM was better than the Compact\u2019s \u2013 it was one of the few areas that they had a definitive edge over their enemies \u2013 and they would routinely send armadas deep into the Compact\u2019s lines, avoiding sensor nets and patrol sweeps until they were ready to strike, often spending months staking out a single target, striking hard and fast before any coherent response could be mustered and then fading back into the trackless void to hit another system. Most of them were little more than deep-ranging reaver squadrons, but Adrianna believed that this one might be a bit larger than that.", "The entire fleet wasn\u2019t here, of course. It would still be deep in interstellar space, but its outriders \u2013 the scout squadrons who pressed ahead, surveying targets and watching for potential threats \u2013 would be. Well, that was what she was hoping. That was why she\u2019d taken Naamah off its planned operations, far from where it could be needed, to kill Sederin\u2019s Boast here in this nameless, unimportant system. She wanted the Principality\u2019s attention.", "Unfortunately, it seem liked they weren\u2019t prepared to give it to her. Not yet.", "\u201cPrepare a widebeam transmission,\u201d she announced. \u201cOmnidirectional. Record on my signal.\u201d She gave her Communications officer a moment to set that up, then made a \u2018begin\u2019 gesture. \u201cThis is Adrianna Leblanc of the Red Hand. Modesty prevents me from assuming you know who I am, but you\u2019ve seen my credentials. I want to talk. I think we have a lot to offer each other. If you want to stay silent, I understand. Talk it over with your Noble. When you\u2019re ready, find one of my ships. There\u2019s a lot of them throughout the Magnameric Canyon. Or you can stay quiet, continue on your way and miss out on an opportunity. Your choice.\u201d Adrianna signalled for her officer to end the recording and send it.", "Leblanc slumped back into her throne. \u201cWell,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cNow I really hope I was right, because otherwise I just wasted a month to take out one cruiser and beseech gas clouds for their aide.\u201d", "\u201cIf you are wrong,\u201d Delauz assured her, \u201cwe will simply say that the gas clouds answered back.\u201d", "As it turned out, that particular embellishment wasn\u2019t necessary.", "Just before Naamah shocked out-system, they received a transmission. There was no voice, no visual imagery. It was a simple piece of information, transmitted from an unknown source, containing nothing that could potentially identify the sender. The only thing in the message was coordinates... and a date. Delauz let out a considering hiss as he looked over the data, the Prelate still not full believing what he was seeing. \u201cOnly the Red Queen,\u201d he said. \u201cCould speak to the abyss and receive a reply.\u201d", "Adrianna smiled, the grin of a she-wolf. \u201cThe abyss and I are good friends. We\u2019ve spent so much time staring into each other.\u201d", "~", "\u201cKursk,\u201d an immortal said, rolling the word down her tongue. \u201cIt\u2019s a little on the nose.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d the human argued.", "\u201cMost military operations don\u2019t hint at their purpose in their name.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019d agree...  if there was anyone left that knew what Kursk was,\u201d Adrianna pointed out. \u201cEven Lucas thinks it\u2019s Operation Currsc,\u201d the woman grinned. The word meant \u2018late breakfast\u2019 in Elamen. \u201cBesides,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s less obvious than Operation Maskirova.\u201d", "\u201cTrue,\u201d Red One agreed. There was a brief pause as if she was mulling something over, although Adrianna knew that starship had already made her considerations, run simulations, threat assessments, calculations and analyzed possibilities. It was one of the tics that she had either been programmed with or adopted from her encounters with organics. \u201cThis will not interfere with your other operations?\u201d", "\u201cMy current operations? Yes. But I think you\u2019ve planned for this to be something of a slow-burn.\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "\u201cThen I can start laying the groundwork now and build up my forces to the point that it will be a minimal disruption.\u201d Adrianna was grinning. \u201cI was planning on that anyways \u2013 this just gives me an incentive.\u201d She leaned over the holographic projection. \u201cSome of this will be beyond what I can do for you. We\u2019ll need access to some seriously heavy industry.\u201d She thought for a moment, then lifted her head. \u201cWhat\u2019s your relationship with the Principality?\u201d", "\u201cStrained,\u201d the starship admitted. \u201cOfficially, there is no relationship. Unofficially, policy towards me is equal parts avarice, antipathy and revulsion. They see me as a way to turn the tide in their war \u2013 at least, once I am dead and gone and they have access to my ship-self. However, they turn a blind eye when I need to... acquire... certain things from them, but this is less out of common cause than apathy.  They consider their losses a small price to pay for the havoc I wreak on the Compact.\u201d Adrianna could almost hear the shrug in Red\u2019s voice. \u201cIf they were given the opportunity, they would gladly make an attempt to seize my ship-self. I make it a point not to spend any longer within their territory than I absolutely must and to avoid needlessly antagonizing them. The lack of information sharing between the Principality and the Compact has proven useful, but if either organization realized what my goals are...\u201d she trailed off in the verbal equivalent of a shrug.", "Adrianna nodded. The briefing Red One had given her had made her head swim, equal parts enthralling and terrifying. She knew that the AI was still keeping secrets from her, but she was proud that the starship had trusted her with as much as she had. It would take time \u2013 years \u2013 to grow her Red Hand to the point that they would be ready for much of this, but the woman was determined not to fail. Red One\u2019s initial assessment had been correct. If the Compact \u2013 or the Principality, or any other star nation with an ounce of sanity \u2013 ever learned what she was planning, they would stop at nothing to destroy the starship. And they\u2019d be right to do so.", "Thoughts like that one helped ease her back to sleep on the bad nights.", "\u201cI reached out to the Principality,\u201d Leblanc said, tapping her lips. \u201cWhen I first began operations in the Canyon. They turned me down. I haven\u2019t gone back since, but I think I can make another attempt. They might be more willing this time around and we might be able to get a few things from them and send them to you. If they think that they\u2019re bankrolling another Unbound cartel, that would help keep you off their radar.\u201d", "\u201cAll the unrest in the Canyon is intriguing them,\u201d Red One confirmed. \u201cI expect that they already have operatives monitoring the situation, but until something truly interesting happens, they will refrain from showing their hand.\u201d", "Adrianna nodded. The Magnameric Canyon wasn\u2019t exactly counted among the Compact\u2019s crown jewels. If the sector fell off the map tomorrow, very little would be lost. If, however, the Canyon fell to rebellion...that blow to the ruling species\u2019 pride would be worse than the economic, military and industrial damages put together. The Principality might be enticed into financial support and supplying some of their cast-offs, but they wouldn\u2019t do more than that. Not unless something truly interesting began to happen.", "\u201cWell,\u201d she said huskily, envisioning the beginning of a war. \u201cThen I\u2019ll just have to see what I can do to pique that interest.\u201d", "~", "The provided rendezvous was not in fact at the coordinates provided. The only thing of interest in this system was a civilian communications satellite. Utterly unremarkable \u2013 it was like every other design in the Compact, without as much as a single rivet from the Principality, but it was new: someone had placed it here within the last few days. It was also transmitting a rambling, interwoven message providing a second set of navigational data and stressing that the data was not to be shared. There were also explicit instructions to carry out the shock from a very specific point in the system. There would be a shrouded ship or ships lying in wait there, close enough that they would be able to identify her destination. If she went anywhere but those coordinates, they would follow and destroy her before she could share the data with anyone else.", "There was probably another warship watching her. The Principality\u2019s stealth technology, once considered a poor man\u2019s version of proper shrouds, was slowly but steadily pulling ahead of the Compact\u2019s designs. In lieu of vessels that could stand up to the Space Force one to one, the Principality Argosy was doing everything in their power to prevent their ships from ever being hit in the first place.", "\u201cTake us to the specified coordinates,\u201d Adrianna ordered. \u201cUse the provided navigational data. We\u2019ve been extended an invitation. It would be rude to ignore it.\u201d", "~", "Naamah emerged under the guns of seven different capital ships, the lightest of them cruisers. As soon as the pirate\u2019s scopes came back up, alerts squealed through command in recognition of active sensors. \u201cMultiple target locks,\u201d Delauz confirmed, hissing in agitation. \u201cHeavy jamming, but we are able to get visual images from the nearest vessels.\u201d", "\u201cShow me,\u201d Adrianna ordered. None of the ships had opened fire; that was a good sign. In theory.", "\u201cCommander,\u201d Tactical put in. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we raise our screens?\u201d", "\u201cIf you think it will make a difference if those ships decide to open fire, then by all means,\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cNow will someone show me just who is targeting us?\u201d", "Delauz chortled. \u201cImagery coming to the main screen now, commander.\u201d When she was aboard Naamah and among her own people, Adrianna preferred to be called \u2018commander\u2019. It was an archaic term, one that hadn\u2019t been used in the Compact for thousands of years and it appealed to her far more than \u2018majesty\u2019, \u2018highness\u2019 or any of the other associated honourifics that went with her title of Red Queen. More than one Unbound leader had killed an underling or started a clan war when someone had failed to address them with the pomposity that they felt that they deserved. She\u2019d managed to wean most of her crew off the more ostentatious descriptors, but Adrianna wasn\u2019t above pushing that issue \u2013 particularly among the other cartels \u2013 if she felt that someone was being deliberately disrespectful, but a simple \u2018commander\u2019 or \u2018queen\u2019 suited her better among her Red Hand.", "\u201cThere,\u201d Adrianna said with a smile. \u201cThere you are.\u201d", "Compact warships were smooth-hulled, with gentle curves only occasionally broken up by various structural features. Occasionally slightly asymmetrical, they evoked the imagery of deep ocean predators: massive, unrelenting, fast despite their size and enormously destructive. They were often given earthern hues, their dull colours broken up by pale banding and vivid squadron markings.", "The Principality\u2019s design philosophy was widely different. They gave their ships an almost avian appearance: hard angles with smoothed edges, often with prows like raptorial beaks. Many possessed flaring wings that, on larger vessels, comprised multiple decks and were filled with forward-facing railguns and weapons emplacements. Compact warships were built to engage an enemy at virtually any position in their field of fire. Askanj warships tended to focus their armament for crushing alpha strikes, hammering the foe so badly with their first exchange that they were incapable of fighting back. That was a survival mechanism; Compact warships were hard to kill \u2013 as long as the vessel was still functional, it could still fight. Compact warships always won the endurance game \u2013 they had to be taken out quickly and thoroughly. More than one \u201chulk\u201d had unexpectedly come back to life, surprising its would-be killers.", "Naamah was sent a route to follow, with the strict stipulation that any deviation from it would result in their destruction. Any attempt at active scanning would result in their destruction. Powering up their weapons would result in their destruction. The cruiser wound its way along the periphery of the fleet, closer watched for any sign of duplicity. Despite the number of guns trained on her ship, Adrianna was smiling.", "~", "They asked her to come alone. The idea of having more than the bare minimum of Unbound aboard their command ship was apparently none too palatable. It was hard to argue with that assessment and Adrianna had agreed, though there was some minor quibbling from her own crew (particularly her own guards), but she pointed out that if the Askanj wanted her dead, they had a fleet to do it with. If for some reason they wanted to kill her in person, an Askanj supercarrier held, at a bare minimum, hundreds of Legionnaires. No amount of bodyguards or armsmen would be able to protect her.", "Adrianna didn\u2019t know much about Askanj ships \u2013 most of her information on them came from Nemesis, but the vessel Naamah was led to had to be one of their supercarriers. Almost nine kilometers long, it carried enough firepower to crush an entire fleet, but had none of the staying power or defences of a Triarch\u2019s Chariot. It was very much a \u2018glass cannon\u2019, but that only meant that it fit in perfectly with the Jackals\u2019 military philosophy. Kill before you were killed.", "She was scanned quite thoroughly before allowed to leave the hangar, but it was primarily a surface scan to check her for any potential weapons or implements of destruction she might bring into the presence of their fleet\u2019s commander.  Without a more invasive sweep, the sensor bafflers built into her body would camouflaged her true nature. Fortunately, the Principality were less concerned about what was inside her than anything she might be attempting to conceal or smuggle in and after that, an unexpectedly bubbly Privilege and a pair of Legionnaires escorted the human to the wardroom of APAV Maledictor. The junior officer and the guards waited outside and Adrianna stepped inside.", "The Noble Fleet Mistress was a Serpent; Adrianna had had little exposure to the Askanj-illth, but she seemed big, even for one of their matriarchs. The fleet leader was sitting upon her coils at the head of a long, curved table, a pair of Askanj-anj armsmen behind her. She raised herself up at Adrianna\u2019s approach, her crest rising slightly as she sized up the Unbound commander. \u201cAdrianna Leblanc of the Red Hand,\u201d she said in acknowledgement.", "\u201cYou have me at a disadvantage.\u201d", "\u201cI am Noble Fleet Mistress Shines Like Fire of the Askanj Principality Argosy Vessel Maledictor. I hope you will forgive my lack of etiquette, but I am not familiar with Broken greetings.\u201d", "\u201cNor I with Illtharie custom. It\u2019s something that I hope to have cause to rectify.\u201d", "The Serpent\u2019s crest twitched at that and she bobbed her head. Before they had joined the Principality and become Askanj-illth, her people had been Illtharie. Today, the use of their species name was considered archaic, but not unwelcome. As Adrianna took her seat and the Noble Fleet Mistress resumed her previous position, the human looked over the Principality fleet commander. Shines Like Fire was aptly named; she was a very rare breed of Askanj-illth with vivid red and yellow scales. Her yellow crest was speckled with black shapes, like sunspots against a star and her eyes were the colour of citrine.", "If the Tribunes were the soldiers of the Compact, then Askanj-illth were their counterparts in the Principality. Illtharie were the wolves of their world; they\u2019d evolved as communal pack hunters, swarming over prey from every angle, bringing down megafauna in writhing balls of coils, slashing claws and venomous bites. Even today, thousands of years removed from that ancestry, Serpents were masters of squadron command. Despite the Compact\u2019s traditional advantages in void war, more than one Compact Leader had died from the incessant strikes of an Askanj-illth-led force.", "\u201cUnbound,\u201d the Serpent said, her fingers steepled. \u201cCreatures outside the bounds of law, of society, morality, civilization or decency. We have our own pirates and raider filth, our \u2018Renegades\u2019, but not so many as the Compact. It is an endless source of amusement that a civilization that glorifies itself to the extent that yours does has so many willing to turn their back on it.\u201d", "\u201cIt should come as no surprise,\u201d Adrianna said, \u201cthat a society as regimented and oppressive as the Compact sees so many raiders. Deny someone a voice for long enough and they will lash out.\u201d", "\u201cAnd be struck down by the masters\u2019 hands,\u201d Shines Like Fire pointed out. The tip of her tail twitched. \u201cThe Compact endures.\u201d Her inner eyelids blinked. \u201cRed Queen. That is a name I have heard. At first only sparingly, another Unbound dreg with an unearned title. Then, in laughter. A Broken. A species so pitiable even the Compact sees no need to mince words with their title. This creature would don the garments of war? Laughable.", "\u201cBut,\u201d the Serpent\u2019s lips drew back, showing her teeth. \u201cThe laughter ended and I have heard the Red Queen spoken of with grudging respect from those that hate her. I have heard interest from our own analysts. I have heard contempt from the Compact\u2019s dogs. So, I have become interested in this title of \u2018Red Queen\u2019 and the woman who wears it. I have watched her take a sector under the thumb of the CST, inflaming minor quibbles and issues into points of violent disagreement. I have listened as she excoriates the downtrodden to stand up, the indoctrinated to think for themselves and the shackled to break their chains. I have seen her fail a hundred times, but succeed wildly in the hundred and first. And,\u201d Shines Like Fire said with an amused hiss. \u201cI have become intrigued.\u201d", "\u201cI was hoping I\u2019d catch your attention,\u201d Adrianna said.", "\u201cYou have. I am curious as to how you located my scouts, but we can discuss that shortly. I would be honoured if the Red Queen would join me for dinner.\u201d", "Adrianna tipped her head. \u201cI would be delighted to do so, and I look forward to the conversation.\u201d", "~", "The meal was delicious. Askanj-illth were almost entirely carnivores, but Shines Like Fire had accounted for her guest\u2019s needs and Adrianna had enjoyed a delightful side salad to go with her roast... whatever it had been.", "\u201cThank you for your hospitality,\u201d Adrianna said as a handful of stewards appeared, cleared the table, refilled the empty glasses and vanished. \u201cWhat now, though? Do we dance around the issue of trust?\u201d", "The fleet mistress chuckled. \u201cIf you are a Compact infiltrator, you are one that has cost them far more than the elimination of a single ghost fleet. Still, many of my officers believe that you are less a liberator and more a particularly successful breed of renegade. Another self-serving charlatan who cloaks herself in a raiment of lies.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve been underestimated since I was born,\u201d Adriann replied evenly. \u201cI\u2019ve had to prove myself since that time, too.\u201d", "\u201cSeveral of those same officers counseled me to kill you,\u201d Shines Like Fire continued, perfectly at ease. \u201cThat your knowledge of my fleet\u2019s location was a grievous security risk. But I think,\u201d her grin widened and her teeth gleamed. \u201cI think you would only betray my position if it meant feeding a pack of hounds into my guns.\u201d", "Adrianna arched an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s quite... trusting of you.\u201d", "\u201cPerhaps it is.\u201d Shines Like Fire picked up a glass of water. \u201cAs I have said, I have heard of the Red Queen. I have fought for long enough to recognize a fellow predator.\u201d She took a small sip. \u201cI am not sure how much you know of my species, but we are not fond of the Triarchs, nor the hounds they set upon our worlds. We used to have a nation of our own until it was taken from us. Our worlds were stolen. Ask any woman or man of the Askanh-illth about the Compact and you will receive the same answer. Hate. Nothing is more honest than that. Seeing you... I believe I see the same honesty in those eyes. Am I wrong?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d Adrianna said after a moment. \u201cI grew up on Rally \u2013 the one world us \u2018Broken\u2019 are allowed to have as our own. They restrict our population growth, dictate the jobs we\u2019ll have, the places we can live, the laws we can make, what we can say and what we can watch. The \u2018non-compliant\u2019 become criminals, are given drugs to regulate their \u2018anti-social tendencies\u2019 or are sent offworld to die for the state that hates them. All for our own good. And we believe it. We believe that there is something wrong with anyone who doesn\u2019t follow the Compact. Because we believe them. We believe that we need them to control every facet of our lives. They pulled us back from the brink \u2013 they never get tired of telling us that \u2013 and are doing everything for our own good. Because we\u2019re too uncivilized, too stupid, too short-sighted to think and act for ourselves. We thank them for it, thank them for the \u2018burden\u2019 that they accept on our behalf. There\u2019s a word the Rally-born Tribunes have for us, you know. Keb\u2019esh. \u2018Sheep\u2019. I believed it too, for the longest time. I hated myself for the questions I asked. I hated even more that I was too afraid to talk to anyone else about them. I wondered what was wrong with me... and then I knew. I knew it wasn\u2019t me. It was everyone else.\u201d Adrianna chuckled, low in her throat. \u201cThat\u2019s one definition of crazy, isn\u2019t it? But I couldn\u2019t let go of that thought, no matter what I did. I ran from my world, still wondering if I was the problem. Trillions of people would say yes... but I looked at the rest of the galaxy. I looked at the Compact, its self-styled superior rulers and the chattel under their feet. I saw all that and realized that I wasn\u2019t the problem... but I was going to make sure I became one.\u201d", "Shines Like Fire hissed from deep in her throat, the sound one of consideration. \u201cSo tell me, Red Queen \u2013 why have you sought out the Principality?\u201d She grinned, exposing a wide mouth of sharp incisors. Unlike the Xensiri, pre-history\u2019s Illtharie had killed their prey with a combination of venomous bites and ripping claws. As a result, their mouth and jaws developed more like those of a human rather than the dagger-mawed Prelates. The Noble Fleet Mistress\u2019s fangs were hidden, at rest inside their sockets in her upper jaw. That was actually why the Serpents generally saw smiling as a welcoming, friendly gesture \u2013 it showed the person that you were smiling at that your deadliest weapons were not ready for use. Illtharie did not trust toothless smiles, which had led to some misunderstandings when they had first joined the Principality. The Askanj-anj saw toothy grins as inherently threatening and only closed-mouth smiles as good-natured. Since the Illtharie were now the Askanj-illth, such quibbles had been readily solved. It had, however, led to the expression: \u2018Never trust a snake when you can\u2019t see her teeth.\u2019", "\u201cThe Compact has accused my government of supplying weaponry to a known terrorist organization. This, I was prepared to dismiss as another in a long line of falsehoods intended to muddy our scales. And then my scouts reported certain things to me. It is expected that Unbound and renegades will perform nonstandard modifications to their ships. What I did not expect is the nature of some of your upgrades.\u201d The Askanj-illth\u2019s inner eyelids blinked. \u201cYou are using Principality technology.\u201d", "\u201cI use whatever I have available.\u201d Adrianna replied. \u201cDown to teeth and claws if I must.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s as may be,\u201d Shines Like Fire smiled, her lips closed. \u201cBut someone in my government is supplying you with munitions. This was not sanctioned.\u201d", "\u201cI asked the Principality for help before,\u201d the human said with a touch of anger. \u201cI was denied, so I looked for other sources of assistance.\u201d", "\u201cI am unaware of the circumstances of your discussion with anyone else in my government,\u201d Shines Like Fire pointed out. \u201cHowever, illegal arms shipments are something that concerns us greatly. There are several nations that simply throw money and resources at whatever \u2018liberation movement\u2019 crops up that particular week in the hopes of distracting or damaging the Compact. Most of these would-be revolutionaries die in short order. Others are simply criminals and use this aide to further their illicit and immoral goals. The Principality does not support any organization unless two conditions are met. That we can expect to see some return on our investment and that we can be assured of some level of trust in our agents.\u201d", "\u201cYou want the good PR of funding \u2018legitimate\u2019 freedom fighters and don\u2019t want to worry that the Compact will sniff out your pipelines or get a hold of your tech.\u201d", "\u201cBluntly? Yes. Until recently, your Red Hand satisfied neither of those requirements. Your brutality is well-known, commander. We do not support those who commit atrocities.\u201d", "\u201cUnless the benefit of it outweighs the bad PR,\u201d Adrianna pointed out. She took another sip. \u201cI won\u2019t give you my source. I won\u2019t even pretend that appearing to have the official backing of the Principality hasn\u2019t been helpful. I have two questions, though. You said that \u2018until recently\u2019, we didn\u2019t meet your criteria for support. Have we done so now? Secondly, if you\u2019re going to get tarred for supporting the Red Hand no matter what you do, why not help us? I\u2019m not asking for direct military assistance \u2013 just what you give to every other proxy you use. Well,\u201d Adrianna\u2019s eyes glinted. \u201cMaybe a little more.\u201d", "Shines Like Fire was silent for a moment, the tip of her tail twitching faster. Finally, she smiled widely, again flashing her mouthful of teeth. \u201cI believe,\u201d she said with approval. \u201cthat this is something that bears further thought.\u201d", "~", "Adrianna was watching the last stand of Noble Fleet Master Akrym Votan. She should be heading back to Naamah, but Red One had wanted to show her this last bit of information. It was, the starship had told her, the perfect example how everything could go wrong after going right.", "She\u2019d always had an aptitude for tactics. Strategy was harder. She\u2019d seen what happened to people who didn\u2019t bend, who were convinced that they were infallible and that they\u2019d covered every angle. Sath had died believing that no Broken \u2018child\u2019 could nor would raise a hand against him. Vuld had died with the realization that his azea haal had never been his at all. She\u2019d destroyed other Unbound kings and queens, politicians and military officers the same way, but as her advisors liked to tell her, she couldn\u2019t rely on luck forever. So she studied, she listened, she learned. She\u2019d been doing that ever since she\u2019d first watched her father work, since she\u2019d first discovered that old, filth-caked archive containing data from a time before humans had been \u2018Broken\u2019. She\u2019d spent weeks cajoling the centuries-old scrap to work again, until finally grainy reams of information had appeared on her computer screen. Fragmentary and barely incoherent, at first she\u2019d thought it was some kind of forgery or elaborate hoax, but the more she\u2019d studied it for flaws, the less she\u2019d been able to explain away and the more she\u2019d delved into other proscribed material.", "Nemesis rises.", "The woman turned her attention back to the information on display. The Askanj commander had made several errors and Bastion Leader Hdenik (and nine names besides) had destroyed the Noble Fleet Master\u2019s armada. The thing was, each mistake had been small, each one was justifiable, understandable and could easily have been made by any officer in any navy. Hdenik had made an equal number of minor missteps, but as the saying went \u2018he who makes the last mistake loses\u2019 and that had been Votan.", "Two fleets of roughly equal disposition and capability, two commanders of roughly equal skill. Theory said that any battle should have been a draw. Instead, it was known as the Slaughter of Corkhan\u2019s Crossing. Two-thirds of the Askanj fleet had been destroyed. That by itself should have been an incredible victory. Instead, it was a disaster for both sides. The Compact fleet had fared better than Votan\u2019s armada... but not by much. Hdenik herself had been killed, along with all souls on her sigil. With their command ship lost and most of its deputies taken out early on, the Compact fleet hadn\u2019t fallen back when they should have and had continued their advance, right into the range of the Askanj\u2019s energy torpedoes.", "\u201cNever assume that you know what your enemy wants and what they will do,\u201d Red One told Adrianna as the battle reached its final pitch, the mangled remains of both forces fighting on long past the point that they should have. \u201cNever think that just because you\u2019ve done everything right, things can\u2019t go wrong.\u201d", "Adrianna nodded, watching as the remnants of the Compact armada managed to extricate themselves from the Askanj lines, regrouping and allowing the Jackal forces to break and run. At one point, she had entertained the idea that she was being groomed to command Nemesis, but she\u2019d realized how ridiculous the idea was. Red One had more combat experience than any organic officer short of a Triarch ever would, she could think and act in the time it took a human heart to beat \u2013 she\u2019d long since outgrown the need for a mere captain. No, she didn\u2019t need a captain.", "She wanted a general.", "~", "Lucas had always hated snakes. When he was eight, he\u2019d fallen through a sinkhole into a colony of striped vipers. Their venom wasn\u2019t nearly as deadly as that their Terran counterparts. In fact, the handful of introduced Terran snakes (and who in the Hell thought it was a good idea to rescue snakes of all things from the Cataclysm?) were the deadliest reptiles on Rally. Of course, when you were bitten by three dozen of the damned things, quantity was its own quality. There hadn\u2019t been a part of him that hadn\u2019t been bloated and aching. It had been three days before the swelling had gone down enough for him to see again. Ever since then, snakes had been on Lucas Harker\u2019s personal shit list.", "So being in a confined space with nearly twelve feet of Tribune-killing muscle, claws and scales was not his idea of a good time. Adrianna, damn her, didn\u2019t seem bothered at all by Shines Like Fire. The Noble Fleet Mistress was big, even for her species, almost three and half meters from nose to tail and the latter was over two-thirds of her body length. At rest, Shines Like Fire only came up to Lucas\u2019s chin, but that tail was all muscle and easily capable of supporting her if she chose to raise herself up.", "The Askanj-illth smiled toothily in greeting and slithered towards Adrianna, raising herself up just enough to look the human in the eyes. She and Leblanc clasped each other\u2019s forearms, then shook hands \u2013 one Serpent and one human greeting. Since their first meeting, Adrianna had spent time brushing up on Askanj customs. The Principality was made up of about a dozen different species, each with their own quirks, preferences and traditions. In order to ensure that everyone was represented equally, when beings from different cultures met, customs from each (where appropriate), were observed. The traditions of the host were observed first and then those of the visitors.", "Instead of the enforced common culture of the Compact, the Askanj allowed their member races to retain all their own social mores, customs, taboos and idiosyncrasies, which could often lead to misunderstandings. Although the Principality talked much about the unity of their people, the truth was that they were far less unified than they tried to present to outsiders and the Compact had ruthlessly exploited these internal divisions, once pushing the Principality to the brink of civil war. There was something to be said for having a single voice and a single direction.", "As Adrianna introduced him and Shines Like Fire introduced her own second-in-command, a slightly-built Askanj-anj male, Lucas repeated the greeting gestures with the alien fleet leader. Her skin was surprisingly smooth and warm. Shines Like Fire gestured towards a conference table, sitting on her own coils as her second and the two humans took their own seats. It had taken a few months since Adrianna\u2019s first meeting with the ghost fleet, but the Noble Fleet Mistress had agreed to provide some limited assistance to the Red Hand. Nothing too overt \u2013 some spare parts and a few advisers, both technical and military. In return, the cartel had offered some of the information they\u2019d gathered on Compact personnel, forces, dispositions and movements within the Canyon and its neighbouring sectors.", "\u201cThank you for agreeing to meet with me on such short notice,\u201d Adrianna began. \u201cYour assistance to our war effort has already been invaluable.\u201d", "\u201cAs has the intelligence you have shared with us,\u201d Shines Like Fire replied. \u201cI was surprised to see Naamah on our screens so soon.\u201d She tilted her head. \u201cWhat have you discovered?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve received some information from our agents concerning a threat to my operations within the Magnameric Canyon,\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cI know you don\u2019t have the kind of penetration of Local Command that we do, but I\u2019m betting that your scouting operations are a lot more thorough. They may have noticed something that mine didn\u2019t.\u201d", "Shines Like Fire hissed thoughtfully to herself. \u201cThis is possible. What have you discovered?\u201d", "Adrianna reached into her tunic and removed a small data drive, handing it to Shines Like Fire. The Serpent passed the data to her second in command, who inserted it into a datapad. \u201cTell me,\u201d Adrianna said as the Askanj officers looked over the information. \u201cHave you heard anything about the Onthana system?\u201d", "~", "Jante had been absolutely correct; Naamah had been sorely lacking in crew; the personnel that had stayed aboard the heavy cruiser as it had headed into the trap had all been volunteers, but the Red Hand\u2019s sigil ship was not as undefended as it had appeared. Hidden in sensor-shielded compartments deep within the armoured central core of the warship were nearly two thousand of Adrianna\u2019s finest killers. The Red Hand would never be a true military force, but Adrianna aggressively recruited skilled mercenaries and soldiers, her combat teams training relentlessly under professional tutelage and their recently-arrived Legionnaire advisors. If they would never be up to the standards of Janissaries, they were still a deadlier threat than most other Unbound forces. On their home ground with the element of surprise, the Red Hand forces swept through the Compact boarding teams. Even worse, that two thousand included several handpicked units of Shines Like Fire\u2019s best soldiers.", "The Compact Janissaries had prepared for the lightly armed and armoured forces that were found aboard any pirate vessels, expecting a relative handful of stolen, scavenged or inferior black market-built sets of power armour. The thought that they might encounter Askanj Legionnaires had never been considered.", "Led by the Principality counter-boarding teams, the Red Hand\u2019s forces swept through Naamah in a blitzkrieg, overrunning and destroying isolated Compact sweep teams and smashing through their firepoints. In minutes, every vital area of the ship was back under the Red Hand\u2019s control.", "Adrianna smiled as she listened to the reports of success. Engineering and the main computer were hers again, as well as two of the heavy cruiser\u2019s three secondary reactors. The prisoners the Compact had taken were free. \u201cThe bridge is mine,\u201d she told her soldiers. \u201cSend a replacement command crew immediately.\u201d There was a short, sharp confirmation.", "\u201cAs far as your fleet knows, Naamah is still under your control,\u201d Adrianna observed to the Janissary. He was still kneeling on the deck, his hands on his head. \u201cThey won\u2019t have any issue about letting us come in closer. They\u2019ll protect their prize. You\u2019ll confirm every query they send.\u201d", "\u201cNever,\u201d hissed Jante. He was shaken, but still defiant.", "\u201cTrue. I know better than to question a Tribune soldier\u2019s sense of duty. But something \u2013 someone \u2013 that sounds just like you will do that for us.\u201d Oada\u2019vam was a hard tongue for humans to speak, but Adrianna had learnt it. Vuld had insisted. There was no disguising her accent, though. Fortunately, she didn\u2019t need to. \u201cDo you think,\u201d Jante\u2019s own voice came from the woman\u2019s mouth as she activated implants and speech-mimicry protocols. \u201cThat they\u2019ll figure it out before we stick a knife in their ribs?\u201d", "~", "\u201cYou have everything?\u201d Red One inquired.", "Adrianna patted her tunic, where the \u2018drive the ship had given her sat. \u201cI think so.\u201d She was back to grinning like a schoolgirl. She really would have preferred to stay aboard Nemesis longer, but her crew was antsy enough as it was, her occasional reports back notwithstanding. It was time to head back. \u201cI\u2019ve got more than enough.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just the data Red One had provided. Until that courier had arrived in Minos Perch, Adrianna had thought \u2013 known \u2013 that she was alone, that it was all too likely that the revolution she was attempting to midwife would die with her. Now, though...", "Operation Kursk would take years to come to fruition, as would the rest of the warship\u2019s plans. Red One thought on a timescale greater than most living things could imagine or plan for. Because of that, they didn\u2019t see what she was doing. They patted themselves on the back when they spotted a decades-long pattern. Nemesis had been working on Kursk for over a century already, hiding her true operations beneath interlacing trends of attacks and offensives, serving multiple objectives at once. Some of her strikes were random, designed to confuse and frustrate enemy strategists. Some were focused on accomplishing very specific goals and some appeared to fall into both those categories and only the AI knew which served her ends and which were simple distractions. The Compact had built up and thrown away entire dossiers as they tried to predict the warship\u2019s movements. Adrianna had a chance to be a part of that now, a part of the \u2018Long War\u2019. She wasn\u2019t going to waste it. She was going to make Nemesis rise.", "\u201cTake your time,\u201d the AI said. \u201cAs you said, this is a slow burn. If the choice is between compromising your operations and fulfilling one of those objectives, I can wait.\u201d Even though her avatar couldn\u2019t be projected into the hangar, Adrianna knew Red would have been smiling. \u201cI don\u2019t always enjoy it, but I can.\u201d", "Adrianna nodded. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d She grinned a little wider. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I can\u2019t tempt you to stay in the region?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d Red One replied. \u201cI must attend to my own affairs. You have the information on contacting me, but remember that it will not be a prompt response. It may be months before I am even aware of any message.\u201d", "\u201cI know. Besides...\u201d the human said. \u201cIf I get in trouble, I may have some new friends to call on.\u201d", "~", "\u201cEmergence,\u201d Naamah\u2019s sensor officer reported. \u201cA hundred and twenty sources.\u201d", "\u201cShe\u2019s holding some of them back,\u201d Adrianna murmured. \u201cCan\u2019t say I blame her.\u201d", "\u201cWhat...\u201d Jante whispered as he saw the flurry of blue \u2018ally\u2019 markers splash across the tactical plot. An entire fleet had shocked in just off the nearest planet\u2019s libation point. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d", "\u201cThe second half of a puzzle,\u201d Adrianna said with a savage grin. At the Ideologue\u2019s confusion, she nodded to Operations. \u201cShow him.\u201d", "The Ops officer dutifully responded, bringing up imagery of the newcomers. Askanj warships, led by a pair of supercarriers. They were already dispersing into an attack formation, aimed directly at the Compact fleet. Further down the gravity well and with their acceleration cut to swarm over Naamah, the Compact force had virtually no chance of escape. Fifty Space Force warships was still an unpleasant mouthful, but the pair of massive supercarriers tilted the advantage towards the Askanj. Endless Stinging Swarm was a drone command ship, able to deploy thousands of automated strike craft. Maledictor carried nothing but missiles and missile pods. By itself, it could launch nearly ten thousand missiles in a single salvo, but that would hardly be needed here.", "\u201cYou did good baiting the hook,\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cReliable sources, ones who\u2019d fed us actionable intel before. That was masterful. Were the agents that sent the information ever ours? Did you find out about them later and feed them false information, or was one ours and one yours?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose it matters, but I just wanted to say that your counter-intelligence operation... it was good. A hidden outpost, constructed in secret? It was just the right mixture of desperation and cunning to ring true. The kind of threat that I would have to respond to, powerful enough that I\u2019d need most of my ships. It sounded so perfect, so... true. That\u2019s what made me wonder. So I reached out to a friend. We only had the intel you\u2019d fed us, but she\u2019d noticed your ship movements and deduced that you were preparing for some kind of assault. She thought you\u2019d caught her scent and were readying a counter-attack if she moved on the Canyon. Each of us only had half the picture. You fooled us both.\u201d She smiled cruelly. \u201cUntil we talked.\u201d", "The woman let a moment pass in silence. The Tribune remained silent, biting back his anger. Adrianna gestured to her communications officer. \u201cListen,\u201d she purred. \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d", "\u201c-Adjucator\u2019s Resolve,\u201d the Compact fleet leader was saying. \u201cThis is Compact territory. We have jurisdiction here. Withdraw immediately or we will engage your ships.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s the sound of terror,\u201d she said softly. \u201cA man who knows he is about to die, but is desperately trying to think his way out of it. That\u2019s the irony, you know. He did everything right. He brought more than enough ships here, just in case I had a larger fleet than anticipated. He focused his assault on the greatest threats, he didn\u2019t thin out his forces. Your leader did everything right... and it\u2019s not going to help him.\u201d", "When the response from the Askanj fleet finally came in, it left nothing to the imagination. \u201cOh, leader,\u201d Shines Like Fire chirred with amusement. \u201cPlease do.\u201d", "\u201cLet me show you the future,\u201d the Red Queen whispered to Jante. \u201cYour forces are spread across the Canyon trying to put out every single fire I\u2019ve started. You\u2019re about to lose a full onslaught formation here and then this ghost fleet will cut its way through the sector and beyond. In its wake, my Red Hand will feed. It will be months before the Compact can drive us from the space lanes and we\u2019ll use that time to grow, preying on all those worlds that you left helpless. Our claws will sink into every system, infesting and corrupting. Once they\u2019re victorious, your superiors will clap themselves on the back, proud of how quickly they brought order back to this troubled sector, but they\u2019ll make the same mistake you did. They\u2019ll see us run and think it\u2019s because we\u2019re frightened, outgunned and unwilling to stand against them. All the while, we\u2019ll still be here. In the shadows, in the soil of every world we\u2019ve touched. Growing stronger. And then...\u201d", "The Tribune turned his head towards her. Hatred, revulsion and comprehension glinted in all four of his eyes. \u201cThe fire will rise,\u201d he said, pronouncing each world with loathing. His muscles tensed. He was getting ready to make his move.", "\u201cYes,\u201d Adrianna purred. \u201cIt will.\u201d Her finger gently squeezed the trigger.", "Handing the oversized pistol off to her armsmen, the Red Queen gestured to a pair of ratings. \u201cGet that out of here.\u201d They hurried to drag Jante\u2019s body away as Leblanc tapped her comm. \u201cSever to Flicker. Status?\u201d", "\u201cAll primary objectives secure,\u201d Flickers Through Grass reported. \u201cSeveral secondary sites have been taken. We are making a final push on the last coils of resistance. Your ship is yours, Red Queen.\u201d", "\u201cThank you, Overseer. The Legion is every bit as capable as I have heard. Several Compact warships are moving in to tether us. I suspect they\u2019re trying to escape with their prize. We\u2019ll hold fire until your Noble Fleet Mistress engages the Compact. Once we do, things will get... bumpy.\u201d", "\u201cUnderstood,\u201d the Legionnaire replied. \u201cWe will be prepared.\u201d", "\u201cGood. I\u2019ll leave you to the hunt.\u201d She offered the Legionnaire an Askanj-illth benediction. \u201cStrike with vigour, Overseer.\u201d", "Closing the channel, Adrianna took her place on her command throne. \u201cOperations, confirm engine readiness for high energy maneuvers. Guns, go over our functional weapon batteries and draw up a shooting solution based on that. I want to wait until the Askanj missiles are just outside the Compact\u2019s engagement zone before we engage. I want them as distracted as possible.\u201d There was a flurry of activity as the bridge crew hurried to prepare the stricken Naamah for battle. Adrianna ran her fingers along the arm of her command throne. This ship had been good to her, but she doubted it would be worthwhile to salvage it after this. The Compact would have done it as a point of pride, but the heavy cruiser\u2019s damage was beyond what her outfitting facilities were capable of repairing. One last hunt, she promised the wounded warship. One last battle together, then you can sleep.", "The Red Queen steepled her fingers, watching as the Compact fleet clustered around their prize, still believing it to be under their control. The fleet was changing formation, a shell of escorts dispersing to take the brunt of the assault while the heavier vessels fled down Onthana\u2019s gravity well, looking to buy time and distance until they could flee. It was a small hope, but it was the only one that they had. Naamah shuddered as the heavy cruiser was dragged behind a trio of capital ships. Adjucator\u2019s Resolve was informing Jante to prepare to abandon the ship if need be. She answered in the dead Ideologue\u2019s voice, confirming the orders to bring her back alive if nothing else.", "The task force\u2019s leader was loathe to abandon his prize, but they would be forced to cut the wreck loose very soon. Still, if by chance he were to survive, her opposite obviously wanted something to show for the disaster this mission had suddenly become. Adrianna tapped her forefingers together. His hesitation was going to give her the opening she needed. A touch of irony; if they abandoned the heavy cruiser, she wouldn\u2019t have this opportunity to stick a knife in their ribs. If they\u2019d simply destroyed her, she wouldn\u2019t have a few weapons still functional. She hadn\u2019t counted on either of those things, but she had prepared for them. That was why her best crew hadn\u2019t been on the bridge when its personnel had been massacred.", "It was why there were two thousand of her soldiers and Legionnaires wiping out the last of the Compact boarding teams and a Principality fleet was about to annihilate a quarter of the sector\u2019s best and brightest.", "If there had been an incomplete citadel here, she would have destroyed it and apologized to Shines Like Fire for the waste of time this had been. If the Compact had been determined to destroy the ship, she would have abandoned Naamah entirely, sacrificing it to the enemy\u2019s guns and still launching the ambush. Never assume, she remembered. Always anticipate.", "Instead...", "I will be your general.", "Range counters wound down as Naamah was pulled towards the Compact\u2019s sigil vessel. Adrianna bit her lip, her eyes glinting as she watched the Askanj missiles streak in. \u201cGuns,\u201d she whispered huskily. \u201cNow.\u201d", "~", "Lucas paused, taking a breath to steady himself as he reached towards the door chime. He pressed it once to announce himself, then stepped into the lounge. Like its predecessor, Kubikajiri had one of its observation lounges converted into a miniature arbouretum. Few other than the handful of humans aboard the ship ever came here. As it had been before, it was an unspoken edict from their queen, something quiet and beautiful. Every time he entered the room, he was reminded of springtime, when the coastal moors of his childhood came into full bloom. That was a lifetime ago; he didn\u2019t even know if he actually remembered the scent of those fields or if he only thought he did.", "He half-bowed to the figure sitting on one of the observatory\u2019s couches. \u201cCommander.\u201d Outside, the scarlet light of the Crimson Shawl glittered in, bathing the entire deck in faint red hues. Silhouetted against the nebula were a handful of vassa anka and first two kiran shren. The Red Hand\u2019s newest ships, their \u2018blood born\u2019.", "Adrianna Leblanc stirred, tilting her head towards her second in command. \u201cLeader.\u201d She looked so young. There wasn\u2019t a single wrinkle, crow\u2019s foot or grey hair on her. She hadn\u2019t aged a day since her return from Unicorn Set all those decades ago. Humans were rare enough in the galaxy that few had even noticed and even fewer would think that anything was amiss. There were more than a few nonsapient species where one sex outlived the other. Who knew enough about Broken physiology to say that the Red Queen shouldn\u2019t appear this way? And if anyone did, then they also knew that Leblanc was not quite a baseline human \u2013 her hair was proof enough of that. That was the story anyone who asked was given, but it wasn\u2019t the whole truth.", "It wasn\u2019t just the genetic modifications. In his quieter moments, Lucas had wondered if this woman was the same girl he had seen so many years before. If \u2013 to use a touch of poetry \u2013 the fire that burned in her was actually hers. Not that he was the same man he had been, either. That wasn\u2019t a comment on his own changes as a person, but the physical differences. From the elbow down, the flesh of his right arm was pale and pigmentless as was that half of his torso and face. His right eye was a prosthetic implant.", "It had happened on Verdaun. They\u2019d been ambushed by forces from an rival cartel. He didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d survived the attack, let alone lived long enough to reach a doctor. That was a small irony \u2013 humans were not the most physically imposing of sapient species, but they took to regenerative therapies better than almost any other species. Still, as his eye and mismatched skin attested, it wasn\u2019t a perfect job. He\u2019d never been the best soldier out there and as he got older, he was getting slower. But Adrianna...", "\u201cCommissioner Delk\u2019un released a statement announcing that the last of the seditionists in the Magnameric Canyon were crushed,\u201d Adrianna said, still watching the movements of her armada and the gleaming of the stars beyond the Crimson Shawl. \u201cIt only took them twenty-one years.\u201d", "\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Lucas said, coming around the sofa to sit next to her. \u201cWe also received some communications from our cells in the Canyon. They went to ground just before the start of Operation Clean Brush. Our infrastructure there is mostly intact.\u201d", "Leblanc smiled that she-wolf\u2019s grin. \u201cGood.\u201d True to her predictions, the Magnameric Canyon had burned. Shines Like Fire had swept through the Canyon, smashing every Compact military installation and vessel that she could find, retreating and drawing the Compact\u2019s fleets after her. The Serpent had led her pursuers on a two-year chase as she rampaged through Compact space, drawing every available ship and asset after her before she was finally forced to retreat back to Principality lines.", "In the months it took the Compact to re-establish space superiority in the Canyon, the Red Hand had run rampant. Their new weapons had entered mass production and they had replaced on all their losses in Onthana, even swelling the size of their fleet. They\u2019d sent tendrils into nearby sectors. Another two Unbound cartels had bent their knees to the Red Queen. Profits from smuggling and piracy had increased dramatically.", "Nor had the revolution been neglected. True to her word, Adrianna had been moving slower in the years leading up to Onthana, preparing the way for the mass uprisings that followed in the wake of the destruction of the Canyon\u2019s military forces. Some of them hadn\u2019t even required the Red Hand\u2019s influence as discontent, fear and anger all bubbled to the surface. It had taken months for the Compact re-establish military control of the sector. The Magnameric Canyon had no real strategic value and it had been deemed that stopping the ghost fleet was of higher priority than quashing the \u2018handful\u2019 of malcontents, opportunists and pirates that the local government and CST commissioners assured their superiors were behind the incidents. When officials who weren\u2019t in the CST\u2019s pocket were able to get their reports heard, the Compact had been less than happy to know how bad the situation truly was. Those it deemed responsible became examples. Resignations, yes. Dishonourable discharges. Prison sentences. Public shaming. Even an execution or two.", "That was a good narrative; it wasn\u2019t anger at systematic oppression and subjugation. It was the result of mismanagement and incompetence that had led to a hundred worlds rioting. Those at fault were not self-aggrandizing, racist hypocrites. They were corrupt. They had abused their authority. They had been suborned, they were disloyal. How else could they have let this sector descend into anarchy? How else could they have let the Principality funnel weapons to one of their cats\u2019 paws and miss the presence of a ghost fleet on their very borders?", "It wasn\u2019t the system, it was the fault of a few bad seeds. Sorrowful speeches were made about failures in their duty of care and the public was given their pound of flesh as the worst offenders were punished. Nor was it limited to humility. The displays of violence were held up as examples of the worst type of uncivilized behaviours that the Compact strived to help its client races develop beyond. They were admonished for listening to demagogues and charlatans, for throwing their lot in with the lies of a mentally unstable Unbound. They were told to work within the system, to allow it to heal itself. That such displays of savagery only proved that they were not truly civilized yet, but the Compact would, in its infinite beneficence, forgive them. They were young and did not fully understand everything. They would learn. All they had to do was to allow the Compact to help them learn.", "Promises were made, committees were formed. Many of the would-be revolutionaries had laid down their arms at this appeasement. In a gesture of magnanimity, amnesties were offered, sentences were commuted and more speeches were made about reconciliation and a \u2018time of healing\u2019.", "Those who still fought, who refused to believe the smooth lies and shaded truths were labelled as terrorists and Unbound. In the years that followed, many were hunted down and killed. The Compact was very good at this game and it had cost Adrianna more than she wanted, but a solid core of her resistance remained in place. Fighting the good fight. Literally or figuratively. With bombs or petitions and anti-Compact propaganda. Revolutionaries and activists, each fought in their own way, a legacy that the Compact hadn\u2019t been able to wipe away. The Magnameric Canyon had burned. It had taken the Compact two decades to douse the flames, but even then... embers remained. The Red Hand\u2019s legacy, etched in hearts and minds: They can be hurt. They are not invincible.", "Since then, the Red Hand had grown faster than almost any other Unbound cartel ever had. They had at their disposal more firepower than some star nations. They were still far from the largest clan, but they were among the most feared. Their Red Queen had learned much from the Canyon, from every mistake and every victory. Every loss and every triumph. Aboard Kubikajiri, she carried out her campaigns, drawing in mercenaries and idealists in equal measure. The lost, the forgotten, the damned, terrorists and freedom fighters, monsters and madmen. No matter who or what they had been before, once they became part of the Red Hand, they were reborn as soldiers. Everywhere they went, they spread discord and strife, fanning the flames of rebellion. Here, they distributed anti-Compact literature. There, they assassinated politicians. Here, they funneled money towards activists. There, they turned the spaceways red as their warships hunted with wild abandon.", "\u201cYou brought me something else,\u201d Adrianna guessed. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d", "Lucas handed her a datascroll. \u201cA message from Understone sector. They\u2019ve accepted our offer of assistance and request that we act \u2018with all appropriate speed\u2019.\u201d", "She looked over the message. She\u2019d offered her help to the sector once before, but they had turned her down. Now, the rebels were realizing just how bad things were going to get. \u201cThen we\u2019ll do so,\u201d she said. \u201cTell them that I want everything \u2013 everything \u2013 they have on the disposition of local military assets. As a gesture of goodwill, we\u2019ll send our Understone associates a care package and some advisors. That should help until we arrive. Let our in-sector agents know that I want lines of communication and shipment set up and ready to go the instant we move and make sure the local cartels are aware that I expect them not to interfere. I want to slip into Understone like a glove.\u201d", "Lucas nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll set everything up personally, commander.\u201d He turned to go, then paused. \u201cWar?\u201d he asked.", "Adrianna looked over her shoulder at him, smiling like a wolf. \u201cRevolution.\u201d", "~", "I have had allies before. Temporary alliances, born out of necessity. All too often they ended badly. Greed or fear was their downfall. Those who coveted what I am, those who feared it. Trust is something that I have found to be in short supply. I have long since stopped hoping that I will find more than a single ally. My sister, what there is left of her, requires me to kill her over and over. The people I was built to protect see me as a horror that must be destroyed. Other nations desire my technology. My alliances, such as they are, are always short and all too often they end in death.", "I have survived, though. I have lived for two thousand years, raining fire and destruction upon my enemy and I will continue to do so until I have been destroyed. Now, though... now I have found a kindred soul, one who burns as deeply as I do. I wonder sometimes, if I will ever find anyone else like her. Others who will burn as I do. I do not dream, but sometimes I imagine this coming to pass. A legacy, a hope for the future beyond my Long War. It\u2019s foolish, but still... I imagine it.", "Until that day comes, there is still the Red Queen. She and all those who follow her will carry the torch when I finally fall. That will have to be enough.", "The fire rises. One day, it will be an inferno. I cannot say when, or even if it will happen, but it is what both of us fight for.", "And everyone will burn with us."]}
