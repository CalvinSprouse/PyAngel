I can feel the heat of the system\u2019s primary on my hull and I extend my arrays to drink in its energy.

When I was built, I was given very strict protocols of engagement. Tribune ships may be engaged at any time and their installations and personnel are not protected by any laws of warfare. There was much debate about this; some accused Confederate Command of xenophobia and the commission of war crimes. These policies were not about treating non-humans as things, although some of my designers doubtless thought that way. Tribune soldiers cannot be trusted. Ships in distress would lure human vessels in for boarding before self-destructing, ramming or counter-boarding. Surrendered Tribune soldiers would kill medics. The enemy frequently carried out chemical attacks on civilian Confederate colonies specifically to draw out military units. Accordingly, the parameters that allowed me to attack a Tribune vessel were very... relaxed.</i>", "<i>Engaging humans... that was different. Before the war, there were a number of pirate clans and freebooters. During the conflict, there were still such parasites, those who took advantage of the chaos to glut themselves on whatever they could steal. Although Yasmine once referred to my use against these raiders as \u2018swatting flies with artillery\u2019, it was quite possible that I would one day be deployed against them. However, there were safeguards put in place. I\u2019m not sure why. I cannot imagine ever attacking another Fleet unit, but there was a lot of concern about the use of an artificial intelligence in command of humanity\u2019s greatest vessel, despite the necessary of it. Thus, before I engage a human target I must have a clear order to do so from the senior ranking officer. Except in cases of \u201cextreme exigency\u201d.

The bay is depressurized, so my biosensors are useless but I do have active cameras and passive sensors. I monitor patterns of movement, examine physiologies and listen in to their communications.

It was a monstrous thing: at least three krems long and massing gods-knew how many millions of auhs, covered with weapons batteries, turrets, communications and sensor antennae and other structures that he could only guess at. It boggled his mind to see the Other in such detail; the people who had built it were as far from the Rylethe Federation as they were from their own jungle-dwelling ancestors. The awe he felt for the people who could create such a thing was not the only emotion he felt; there was also a deep streak of terror for the ones that had wounded the Other so grievously.<br>\n <br>\nIts injuries were all too obvious to the naked eye; burnt and molten hull plates, vast chasms ripped into its body, cracks and fissures, scars and tears.

Spinal turrets rotated towards Host One and the Verrishan spacecraft\u2019s radar was suddenly thrown back into its own face in a wall of squealing static.<br>\n <br>\nControl was clamouring for his attention, but Anrelu couldn\u2019t answer them. The last thought he had, that he was convinced he was going to have, was that they\u2019d tripped some proximity sensor that the probes hadn\u2019t. They were too big, their course too direct \u2013 it didn\u2019t matter.<br>\n <br>\nHe waited for oblivion.<br>\n <br>\nIt didn\u2019t come.<br>\n <br>\nSomehow, he managed enough mental wherewithal to report the situation to Control.

Anrelu was sweating inside his suit, knowing that some strange intelligence was considering him and the tiny, arrogant speck of metal that had come calling, daring to approach the titan. He almost jumped when, with languid grace, the gargantuan vessel began to pulse with light, patterns flowing across its hull. Arrows, he realized. It was beckoning them towards a docking bay.<br>\n <br>\n\u201cTake us in,\u201d he ordered the helm, something of scripture running through his head, when the All-Mother spoke to Bethem upon the mountain.<br>\n <br>\nI have seen you and all your sins. I have judged you.<br>\n <br>\nAs Host One approached the alien vessel, Anrelu could only pray that this god would not find them wanting.</i>", "<i>\u201cThey are coming.\u201d<br>\n <br>\nAnrelu froze in place as the words echoed through the still air of the Visitor\u2019s command deck. He looked over at the rest of the contact team, their faces mirroring his own surprise. They had made their way here \u2013 rather, they had been led \u2013 through corridors scarred by ancient damage. Of the vessel\u2019s crew, there was no sign. Every time they had stopped, guide lights had come to life, urgently beckoning them onwards until they had reached this place.<br>\n <br>\n\u201cThey are coming.\u201d The words, in perfect Rylean, repeated.<br>\n <br>\n\u201cWhat...\u201d it came out as a croak. Anrelu cleared his throat and tried again. \u201cWho is this?\u201d He asked of the air. \u201cWho\u2019s coming?\u201d<br>\n <br>\nA diode on the dais in the center of the room began to blink. Slowly, the astronaut approached it, ignoring the rest of his team. As he stepped closer the dais came to life, projecting a ghostly column of pale light straight into the air. Not a dais \u2013 some sort of holographic projector. A great wheel of stars hung before him; their own galaxy. A green circle appeared around one star in particular and the image began to zoom in by stages. Soon, a blue-green world with very familiar landmasses appeared. Vara, and her single moon Tal. A green arrow appeared on the map, pointing to a small speck of light around Vara, outside the orbit of the moon. Anrelu reached out to it and a picture-in-picture appeared, showing the Visitor.<br>\n <br>\n\u201cIncredible,\u201d the mission lead breathed, lost in the beautiful, simple details of what he was seeing. Even Vara\u2019s clouds drifted and shifted in perfect mimicry of, he was sure, how his planet appeared now.<br>\n <br>\nThen, the spell ended. The image zoomed back out until the galaxy was before him again. The green circle around the Vara Tal system was still there, but there were now red marks around several distant worlds, far across the galaxy. Then, like a creeping tide of blood, red began to spill outwards from those points consuming hundred \u2013 no, thousands \u2013 of star systems before stopping. A marker appeared:<br>\n <br>\nCOMPACT EXPANSION: FIRST PHASE<br>\n <br>\nThen, another spread of red flowed across the stars, the original territory almost doubling in size.<br>\n <br>\nCOMPACT EXPANSION: SECOND PHASE<br>\n <br>\nThere was a third phase. A fourth. At the fifth expansion, a single star blinked blue, even as it was swallowed by the red. Anrelu swallowed, realizing that he was seeing the Visitor\u2019s homeworld be consumed by this unknown, ravenous polity. Images appeared \u2013 what had to be vessels of these \u2018Compact\u2019; bloated, swollen things with curved, bulging hulls completely unlike the blocky, inelegant grace of the Visitor\u2019s form.<br>\n <br>\nCOMPACT EXPANSION: SIXTH PHASE. The red was growing closer to the little green circle and Anrelu suddenly felt his breath catch in his throat as a faint pink aura enveloped Vara Tal.<br>\n <br>\nPROJECTED AREA OF COMPACT EXPANSION: SEVENTH PHASE<br>\n <br>\nThe chamber was deathly quiet as the contact team all took in what they were seeing, the silence so complete that when the Visitor spoke again, Anrelu almost cried out in surprise.<br>\n <br>\n\u201cThey are coming,\u201d the wounded god whispered.<br>\n <br>\nAnrelu looked around at the majesty of the Visitor, his eyes returning to the map and the small green circle, alone amongst a sea of red stars.<br>\n <br>\nThen he noticed the timer.</i>", "<i>Anrelu had been on home soil for several days before the Visitor left. He watched it go through the feed from Deep Space 10. The energy of its departure was, for an instant, greater than Vara Tal\u2019s own sun.

Vara Tal\u2019s first extraterrestrial visitor was gone, after generations of gracing their night skies. It was gone. He stood up, surrounded by politicians, military officials and scientists. They had all seen the same thing and their mood was somber. \u201cWhat now?\u201d he asked quietly.<br>\n <br>\n\u201cThe 51st International Conclave is in two weeks,\u201d the Rylean Minister of Visitor Affairs said. \u201cThe message...\u201d he paused, looking towards several of the other dignitaries. \u201cIf it is true,\u201d he added with no real conviction.

As the armoured doors of the bay closed, Adrianna could just barely see the form of the freighter </i>", "<i>. It wasn\u2019t the most extravagant ride she\u2019d ever had, but it would do. As the doors closed and the atmosphere flooded back into the bay, the young woman picked up her duffel bag and trotted towards the waiting shuttle. It was a boxy, utilitarian affair, one of countless millions across the galaxy. There was no pilot. For that matter, there was no crew aboard the freighter waiting for her. Not anymore.<br>\n <br>\n\u201cI have pre-programmed a single warp into the freighter\u2019s mainframe,\u201d Red One reminded Leblanc. \u201cIt will take you to Namadine Prek.\u201d<br>\n <br>\nThe young woman nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll see what my loyal submissives have been getting up to.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI think I might have to kill at least one of them.\u201d<br>\n <br>\nThe ship did not have a reply for that. \u201cBe careful,\u201d she said instead. \u201cMy modifications have improved your abilities substantially, but they do not make you immortal.\u201d<br>\n <br>\n\u201cI know,\u201d Adrianna replied. She\u2019d been given much, but there was a price. In addition to all her improvements, Red One had installed a security measure \u2013 a self-destruct charge that would remove any trace of Leblanc\u2019s implants. If she were ever killed or captured, the Compact would never know the true nature of her upgrades. Adrianna could set it off at will, if she chose. \u201cI\u2019ll be careful. Well,\u201d she amended. \u201cMore careful.\u201d<br>\n <br>\n\u201cPlease do,\u201d Red One hesitated a moment. \u201cI know you want to focus your efforts on Rally,\u201d she said. This wasn\u2019t the first time she and Adrianna had had this argument. Leblanc had, at last, come around to the ship\u2019s rationale. Though the Compact was extremely watchful of the humans, it treated them with a <i>slightly</i> lighter touch than it did many other client races. It did this because less out of magnanimity than out of concern that harsh treatment might spur <i>Nemesis</i> to correspondingly harsh actions. If, however, Adrianna focussed her attentions on Rally, the Compact would respond \u2013 and likely not in moderation. Though the truth of humanity\u2019s history was lost, even to many in the Compact itself, enough of them remembered the Confederacy\u2019s \u2018crimes\u2019. They would never let such things happen again. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d<br>\n <br>\nAdrianna\u2019s head came up and her eyes flashed. It had been a frequent argument, but it was the one she resented losing the most. \u201cI know,\u201d she said, more harshly than she liked. \u201cI know,\u201d she repeated, moderating her tone. Her gaze dropped to the deck. \u201cI know. I... don\u2019t want to,\u201d she admitted. \u201cWhen I was little, I used to look around at all the other boys and girls in my neighbourhood, how happy they were. I wasn\u2019t. I kept asking myself what was wrong with me. I saw the same question in my parent\u2019s eyes after every altercation. I saw it in the confessors\u2019 and counsellors\u2019 eyes when I was lectured on how to behave. I heard exasperated teachers ask it of me. It was even the last thing Commissioner Sath said when I killed him. \u2018What is wrong with you?\u2019. Every day of my life I\u2019ve had that question in my head. Why couldn\u2019t I fit in. Why couldn\u2019t I be like everyone else?\u201d Wetness pooled in the corners of her eyes. \u201cI pushed it all away, so far down that I wouldn\u2019t have to think about it. But it\u2019s not me, is it? It\u2019s them. It\u2019s been a thousand years of social engineering, propaganda and eugenics that did this to them.\u201d She looked up, a tear curling down her cheeks. Her expression, for once, lacked the shields of manufactured sadism, mercurial bravado and every other aspect she donned in her \u2018Red Queen\u2019 persona.\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave them.\u201d<br>\n <br>\n\u201cYou have to,\u201d Red One told her. \u201cThe Compact will never stop hunting you. If you try to hold onto Rally, the Compact will only tighten their grip on the world. It will give them every excuse they need to justify their excesses. I won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d<br>\n <br>\nAdrianna nodded, picking her duffel bag back up. She trudged towards the waiting shuttle, then paused just before the ramp. \u201cDo we have a chance?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo we have a chance at all?\u201d<br>\n <br>\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the ancient machine said after a moment. \u201cMore of one before we met. It\u2019s still not much. I haven\u2019t hoped for a very long time.

Tribune anatomy was only just similar enough to human for rough comparisons to be drawn in form and function, but there were still... differences. \u201cYou speak above your station, little spark,\u201d she said wetly, running her tongue over her teeth. Her blind daylight eyes were covered by a silk cloth and her smaller nocturnal eyes focused angrily on her host. \u201cWe came to this meeting out of respect for the blood your small hand has shed, but we will not be spoken to in such a manner by a human.\u201d Her coterie of underlings rumbled agreement.<br>\n <br>\n\u201cVuld liked my insolence,\u201d Adrianna replied. \u201cHe found it... interesting.\u201d<br>\n <br>\n\u201cVuld was a fool,\u201d Kasht snapped. \u201cHe allowed himself to be killed by a Broken.

The Judiciary raised a finger on one of his small secondary arms. \u201cWe are here to discuss the Red Hand\u2019s encroachment into our traditional hunting grounds, not retread our personal dislikes.\u201d His cracked-gemstone eyes tightened a little as he focused his attention on Adrianna. \u201cHowsoever much it may be warranted.\u201d<br>\n <br>\n\u201c\u2018Shut up and focus on the matter at hand\u2019,\u201d Kasht lowered the pitch of her voice, mocking her fellow Unbound leader. \u201cThat\u2019s all that need be said, Toun. Never one word when three will do, eh?\u201d<br>\n <br>\n\u201cYou were not given permission to use my familiar name, Night Queen,\u201d the Judiciary replied stiffly. \u201cI afford you the courtesy of your station and I expect the same respect be given to my person.\u201d<br>\n <br>\n\u201cI summoned you here in the hopes of avoiding bloodshed,\u201d Adrianna interjected before Kasht could snarl whatever response came to the Tribune\u2019s mind. \u201cThe Magnameric Canyon has over five hundred star systems; nearly a fifth are inhabited and most of those are worlds are under the purview of the Commission for the Stabilization of Territories and the corporations. To lay all our cards on the table... I want the Canyon to run red with blood. I want CST enforcers and overseers to swing from the lampposts on each of those hundred worlds. I want fires to run through the gated communities, the privileged to have to bar their doors at night in fear of those \u2018lesser races\u2019 they\u2019ve used as serfs for the last thousand years.

At worst, you will destabilize the entire region. That is bad for business.\u201d<br>\n <br>\n\u201cSo your answer is no?\u201d<br>\n <br>\n\u201cYou intend to start a war,\u201d the Judiciary pointed out. \u201cI cannot allow that to happen. Your Red Hand is not welcome in the Magnameric Canyon, nor will they ever be. I will grant the forces you have in the region some time to evacuate before I purge them from our holdings.\u201d<br>\n <br>\n\u201cI\u2019ll do one better,\u201d Kasht replied. \u201cI\u2019ll send each of your people back to you, little spark. It will be up to you to put them back together.\u201d She leaned across the table, her lips curling back from her teeth, the tip of her snout centimeters from Adrianna\u2019s face. \u201cAnd I\u2019m putting a bounty on every one of your whore-born lunatics.\u201d Her voice softened. \u201cIf we catch </i>", "<i>...

Warning messages flashed across her HUD and she dismissed them with a thought. She was braced against the side of the station, the magnetics in her boots keeping her from drifting into space. She\u2019d come here to parley for trading rights and instead the treacherous Ar\u2019densai bastard depressurized the entire section, sending her and her escort into space.

Voaml paused, turning around. The Worker\u2019s eyes widened in shock as he saw Adrianna, the surprise turning to fear as she raised her khopesh and thumbed the activation stud. The baleblade\u2019s disruption field flared to life and she rammed it through the door, the metal melting and bubbling as she sawed through the airlock, shoving the door inward and climbing inside. Voaml was shouting into his comm, gesturing for his guards to shoot her, but the inner door was too thick for their bullets. She cut into the bulkhead, exposing the manual release for the second door and pulled on it. The doors opened with a gust of atmosphere, the woman driving her blade into the release mechanism and jamming it open. No one could shut it again.</i>", "<i>She braced herself against the gale, flat against the wall as the first of the enemy guards lost his footing and fell into the stars. The second followed a moment later. Voaml himself had managed a handhold, the Worker\u2019s prodigious strength keeping him in place. Decompression doors had sealed, isolating this section. With the airlock still open, the only way out was the elevator at the end of the hallway... and it would only open for the person holding Voaml\u2019s rank cylinder. He realized this a few seconds after Adrianna did, thumping and bouncing his way to salvation as she bounded after him, the Ar\u2019densai wheezing on nothing as his body cried out for air.</i>", "<i>He was a third of the way to the elevator before she pounced on him, wrapping her arms around his throat. He roared silently, instinctively trying to rear back and crush her against the wall, but he lost his footing and slipped. Desperate, he crawled towards the elevator, his tongue hanging out of his mouth, his eyes bulging and turning red as capillaries burst inside them. Finally, he stopped moving and Adrianna climbed off him, snagging his code cylinder and opening the security doors.

There was a brief pause as if she was mulling something over, although Adrianna knew that starship had already made her considerations, run simulations, threat assessments, calculations and analyzed possibilities.

The briefing Red One had given her had made her head swim, equal parts enthralling and terrifying. She knew that the AI was still keeping secrets from her, but she was proud that the starship had trusted her with as much as she had. It would take time \u2013 years \u2013 to grow her Red Hand to the point that they would be ready for much of this, but the woman was determined not to fail. Red One\u2019s initial assessment had been correct. If the Compact \u2013 or the Principality, or any other star nation with an ounce of sanity \u2013 ever learned what she was planning, they would stop at nothing to destroy the starship.

They might be more willing this time around and we might be able to get a few things from them and send them to you. If they think that they\u2019re bankrolling another Unbound cartel, that would help keep you off their radar.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cAll the unrest in the Canyon is intriguing them,\u201d Red One confirmed. \u201cI expect that they already have operatives monitoring the situation, but until something truly interesting happens, they will refrain from showing their hand.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nAdrianna nodded.
