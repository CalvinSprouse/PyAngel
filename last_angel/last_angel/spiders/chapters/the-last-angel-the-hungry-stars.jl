All to kill a single enemy vessel, but they had succeeded. Group Leader Prime Torten Omin Curz Lalen Cura Strom Dgal, sigil leader of the Compact Space Force War Vessel Glory of Oada, watched as their target died before him. Its hull was cratered and it was breaking apart as the gravity of a gas giant latched onto the ruined vessel and pulled it down into an inescapable embrace. He could still see the beast trying to repair itself, the vessel regenerating even as he watched, but the damage he\u2019d inflicted upon it was too extreme. The planet had it now, and it would pull the towering monstrosity down through thousands of kilometers of clouds into its core, crushing it beyond recognition in the process.", "\u201cNo,\u201d the Tribune said with a satisfied cough. \u201cNo, there\u2019s no escape.\u201d He looked over his shoulder at the armoured doors to the Chariot\u2019s command deck. They were glowing as the creatures on the other side tried to cut their way through. \u201cNot for any of us.\u201d", "Let us in, the dead demanded, their voices rolling through the intercom. Let us in, let us save you.", "For long years, the star system of Anvil 731 had been a lonely outpost on the edge of the Compact of Species, an undermanned fortress watching over distant colonies and providing aid to the far-travelling expeditions that passed through it out into the unknown.", "Frontier regions were always dangerous; fledgling and undefended colonies with supply runs of fat-hulled transports carrying valuable industrial supplies and infrastructure were tempting targets for Unbound. The grip of the Space Force was weak here, with too few ships to cover too much territory. Vermin flourished in such environments, whether criminals, or Jackal ghost fleets. Ships went missing. Worlds went dark. The dead hulks of the former and the silent, depopulated remains of the latter bespoke this kind of predation.", "At first, Local Command believed what was happening in their sector to simply be the inevitable and unpleasant consequences of living in an area far from civilization. More patrols were scheduled, more ships were requested from Force Command, and the inhabitants were warned and educated about matters of safety and security, but losses continued to rise. Rumours began to spread. Anvil 731 did what it could, but there was simply too much territory for its garrisons and patrols to adequately cover.", "There were regions of space more dangerous than others, such as the Agrinna Expanse, the Mortek Star Cluster or the Kaedan Vault. It was suspected that this sector was simply another one of those, perhaps helped along by opportunists such as the Jackals or the Red Hand. That was until the deep-range explorer Eventful Horizons arrived in Anvil 731. Eventful Horizons had been reported missing for several months, one of several such vessels to have disappeared recently. It returned with a dead crew, its hull mangled and holed by weapons fire and databanks showing what it had seen far beyond the edges of known space.", "With that, the Compact no longer considered Anvil 731 to be a minor outpost to be sent whatever could be spared. Support and reinforcements began to arrive in greater numbers. A reconnaissance in force was sent to the coordinates Eventful Horizons had carried, only to find empty space and deserted systems\u2026 at first.", "The recon force\u2019s final message arrived in Anvil 731 upon a courier drone. The last log entry recorded in the drone\u2019s memory banks was a mere two words. They would have been aggravatingly cryptic but for the reams of previous entries, personal records, augur telemetry and technical analyses included within the drone\u2019s data tracks. Still, as a summation of events, they worked well.", "IT\u2019S AWAKE.", "So began years of conflict as Anvil 731 changed from a waypost on the edges of the galaxy, to the center of a clandestine war against an adversary known in official, classified documents as Recombinant. More colloquially, it was known as \u2018the beast\u2019.", "\u201cOne and many,\u201d Torten remembered the briefings he\u2019d been given when Glory of Oada and its armada, once Expansion Force Tresh\u2019at, now Execution Force Uoran, had arrived in Anvil 731. \u201cThere\u2019s only one, but it is many.\u201d Recombinant proved this true. There was only one beast, but it never seemed to run out of bodies or ships. The very vessels that had been reported missing, along with their crews and the populations of stripped colony worlds had all been turned to its purposes. Many of its slave hulls were the even Space Force ships that had themselves disappeared in the course of their duties, or been sent to hunt it down. The slave ships weren\u2019t simply captured prizes; they had begun to change, mismatched and unknown structures rising out of their hulls as if they were slowly being converted into something else. The oldest of Recombinant\u2019s captive fleet barely resembled their original forms, closer in appearance to it than what they had been. As for the people it took\u2026 there was no saving them.", "Half of Execution Force Uoran were lost facing their own ships. Glory of Oada and its remaining fleet had been forced to withdraw as Recombinant itself entered the fray. The vessels they\u2019d abandoned and been unable to scuttle had been repurposed with shocking rapidity. What had once taken Recombinant months and years of examination, study and reverse-engineering to accomplish, it could now do in days and weeks.", "You\u2019ll never have the chance to pass that knowledge on, Torten thought victoriously as he watched the monster die. It was screaming now, calling to any of its blasphemous children to save it, but there were none. Glory of Oada had seen to that. It had been overconfident, and this was the price.", "After the first disastrous battle, Bastion Leader Uoran had devised a plan. The beast had fought enough of the Space Force to know their tactics, so he followed those to the letter, withdrawing from unknown space in a by-the-Writ retreat. Recombinant expected that, setting traps and ambushing the execution force constantly. Uoran\u2019s responses to those were either unimaginative or panicked \u2013 those of a hidebound sigil leader unprepared for what they were fighting \u2013 and the beast easily countered them. Finally, it had them where it wanted them \u2013 caught sunward of it and its slave-fleet. It moved in, eager to claim what was left of Execution Force Uoran and most especially Glory of Oada. The beast wanted the Chariot intact, hungering for the knowledge in its archives and within the minds of its crew.", "Instead, Recombinant arrived to its own death. Even before the first confrontation with the beast, Uoran had kept a portion of his fleet separate from the main body. Those ships were the jaws of the trap and as Recombinant\u2019s fleet advanced on Uoran, that rearguard emerged from stealth and struck the beast\u2019s armada. Those flying columns were completely destroyed, but the surprise and ferocity of their assault took more than two-thirds of Recombinant\u2019s forces with them. The beast\u2019s fleet was irrevocably crippled, its slaves still recovering from the shock of the ambush and attempting to re-order themselves when Uoran ordered the remaining ships forward.", "Giving the order for Glory of Oada to advance was the single most satisfying directive Toret had ever given. The two forces clashed in the close orbit of this nameless system\u2019s largest gas giant. Despite the execution force\u2019s numerical advantage, the beast\u2019s firepower was greater than even that of Glory of Oada, but Uoran hadn\u2019t expected the battle to be settled by arms alone. He\u2019d spent days preparing this battlefield. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been the hunted,\u201d he\u2019d told his senior staff. \u201cWe\u2019ve only been following best.\u201d", "Recombinant hadn\u2019t sailed into a single trap; now, the second set of jaws closed. Tens of thousands of mines had activated around it, beam platforms firing on it as missile platforms vomited their entire arsenal upon it to little effect. The beast reacted faster than any ship either Toret or his leader had ever seen before, but that too was expected. The mines had never been intended to do more than distract it, to buy the engineering teams on a nearby moon the time they needed.", "Explosives buried deep in the planetoid, placed along fault lines and tectonic plates were activated. Drilling charges cored through hundreds of meters of crust, ferrying other charges into additional points of vulnerabilty. In a precisely-timed sequence of detonations, a moon more than a thousand kilometers across blew apart, hurling nation-sized pieces of itself across the battlefield. If the beast hadn\u2019t been fighting its way through the mines, it might have been able to respond in time, perhaps even striking at the sapper sites and preventing the full fury of the blasts. Instead, it had been robbed of those previous seconds and cataclysm was the result.", "The moon\u2019s destruction was impossible to aim, but the devastation was inescapable. Both sides were decimated, with surprised slave ships and forewarned Space Force vessels alike wiped away by pieces of rock and ice hundreds of times more massive than they, or overwhelmed by a tsunami of smaller impacts.", "The beast had no defence against that. Its screens, flaring so brightly that the vessel itself was lost to sight, collapsed under the bombardment. Thousands of pieces of rock, billions of tonnes, struck it and its form, a bent tower more than ten kilometers high, shattered. Hull plates were pulverized, craters were smashed into its hull. Weapons platforms were wiped away, augurs destroyed. The vessel was broken, ruined. Its engines were gone and the escorts that hadn\u2019t themselves been destroyed found themselves receiving the mercy of Glory of Oada\u2019s guns.", "But crippled was not destroyed; the beast was still alive. It struck the execution force with the weapons it had left, killing the remaining handful of the Chariot\u2019s escorts, just as Glory of Oada had done to it\u2019s fleet. Neither side could let word of what happened here escape, but just Uoran had done with the minefield, Recombinant\u2019s attack was a distraction. From its remaining hangars poured assault boats, racing towards the last viable vessel on the field. They sliced through the Chariot\u2019s weakened screens, cut into its hull and from them poured the beast\u2019s final horrors.", "Blood soaked Glory of Oada\u2019s decks as the invaders clashed with security teams and Janissary squads. The defenders made their enemy pay in blood for every meter, but there were too many. For every soldier that the attackers killed, a new enemy arose. Engineering was lost to the beast\u2019s nightmare creations, but too late. They could slow what was going to happen, but not stop it.", "Bastion Leader Uoran had died in Recombinant\u2019s final attack, as had nearly half the command staff, but the bridge was secure. Toret gave his final orders and Glory of Oada initiated a self-destruct. The Chariot\u2019s primary reactor was beginning a cataclysmic overload. When it finally breached, Glory of Oada and everything within thousands of kilometers would be consumed, reduced to nothing but atomic vapour. All that would be left would be Recombinant, and the planet had it. Had it, and refused to give it up. The great vessel was being drawn ever-closer to the storm-wracked clouds with every passing second.", "Glory of Oada had passed the final sentence upon its foe, firing until the last of its guns had been silenced. Recombinant\u2019s primary engines had been destroyed by the moon\u2019s bombardment, but Toret took no chances and ordered the Chariot\u2019s assault accordingly Its thrusters were wrecked, leaving it incapable of even the barest movement. Its hangars were ruined, shredded to uselessness. There was no chance for it or anyone aboard it to escape. Those of its assault craft attached to Glory of Oada not sabotaged or lost in counter-assaults died in desperate flight as they tried to escape beyond the projected blast radius. The Chariot\u2019s point defences were still functional, and none of the beast\u2019s offspring made it out of their range.", "Let us in, the dead beseeched, desperate. Join us.", "This is the end of you, Toret thought, baring his teeth. Years of death and Recombinant\u2019s obscenities were about to end. \u201cWell,\u201d he said as he drew the pistol from his waist. \u201cThere\u2019s no more need to wait.\u201d His staff looked at him. They understood. It wasn\u2019t cowardice. The beast had only one hope left.", "Open the door. You can be part of us. Open it.", "The self-destruct sequence could only be overridden by a senior officer. Uoran was dead, and medical had confirmed that they\u2019d taken the necessary precautions with his body. The rest of the ranking staff had either done the same themselves, or had other personnel\u2026 \u2018assist\u2019 them. Faithful Prime Illm-Thu-Dend had greeted Engineering\u2019s invaders with a smile on his face, and a gun barrel against the back of his head. Toret would do this himself, though.", "His enemy knew what he was going to do. They\u2019d gotten into the security monitors along with the comm array, but didn\u2019t have the access they needed to stop him. Outside the door, they redoubled their efforts. They\u2019d get in before the ship destroyed itself, but even with the bridge and Main Engineering, they wouldn\u2019t be able to stop it. Not without him. They could kill every last soul on the ship, mutilate and defile their remains like all the others and it wouldn\u2019t make a bit of difference. They\u2019d lost.", "This isn\u2019t the end, they told him spitefully. You can\u2019t stop us, Toret. Others have tried. We will survive. ", "\u201cBut not today,\u201d Toret informed his enemy. \u201cToday, you die. There\u2019s no resurrection for you this time.\u201d", "We will survive. There are others. They will awaken. We will be whole.", "Toret didn\u2019t answer. He looked over at his crew. His final words would be to them, and not the creatures that spoke with the voices of the dead. \u201cWe are the sword and shield of the Compact,\u201d he told them. \u201cWe may fall, but others will live. That is our duty and we have fulfilled it today with courage and honour. No matter what happens, you have done more than could have been asked.\u201d He placed the barrel of the gun under his chin and looked upon the viewscreen, smiling victoriously at the remnants of his enemy. It still struggled, but that only prolonged its fate. There was no escape. Not for any of them, but Glory of Oada and its crew had done their duty. He couldn\u2019t have been prouder.", "\u201cThe Compact endures,\u201d he said, just before he pulled the trigger.", "~", "Chapter 1:", "Talage Ormeta swiped his identity card through the scanner. It pinged obligingly, the doors parting to allow the   section supervisor out of the construction yard\u2019s security offices. Less than a year ago, all he would have needed was this, but these days even moving from low-security section to section required an ID card, while all entrances and exits required biometric confirmation and logging. More sensitive areas such as Talage\u2019s own now required even more stringent methods of verification, including genetic verification. Ever since Galhemna\u2019s fall, security within the Maur Tan system had been tightened substantially. Many other systems and worlds had followed suit. He didn\u2019t know if it had done any good. He hoped so.", "An anxious silence had settled across the sector, bubbling over into frenetic work, frightened citizens and widespread unrest. Maur Tan was a nexus for all of those. Once, it had been a minor but growing industrial node in within the Veiled Reaches. Now, it was the center of desperate and hurried plans.", "Galhemna had been a fortress system, the lynchpin of the Veiled Reach\u2019s defences and the center of military power across four sectors and hundreds of star systems. Now, it was a graveyard. Thousands of vessels, military and civilian alike had been destroyed. Sprawling shipwomb facilities hundreds of kilometers across had been obliterated. Mining complexes, armouries, production centers \u2013 decades\u2019 worth of investment \u2013 had all been annihilated under a crushing tripartite assault. Though it would be years before the light of it reached Maur Tan, one of Galhema\u2019s worlds had even been ignited into a new star.", "Now, this former crown jewel of the Veiled Reaches was a broken system, with less than a fraction of its strength and the majority of its industry destroyed. With Galhemna\u2019s fall and the loss of thousands of warships, the entire sector was in peril. Unbound raiders, Jackal ghost fleets, terrorists \u2013 all those and more were licking their chops over the unprotected worlds around them. Ormeta had even heard rumours of something happening within the Black Veil, the great nebula for which the sector was named. He couldn\u2019t have said what, though \u2013 gossip was at an all-time high, and most of the stories were either ludicrously exaggerated, contradictory or both. He knew enough to be concerned, though.", "Ormeta swiped his keycard through another doorway. He grumbled at the annoyance, but that was mostly out of habit. His long strides took him down the hallway towards the security section\u2019s main entrance. His shift was over. Underlings and minor functionaries parted to one side to allow him to pass. He thought nothing of it. Most of them were Didacts, their eidetic memories making them perfect bureaucratic aides. He himself was a Prolocutor, known to antiquity as the Theronas. That was before they had become part of the Compact of Species, and their natural abilities recognized. Talage, like all his people, bore his people\u2019s title proudly.", "His species had evolved from quadrupeds that had learned to stand upright. They hadn\u2019t been apex predators; instead they\u2019d been herd animals that had achieved safety by driving their predators to extinction. Talage, like many of his people, stood about two meters tall, with deep blue skin, a covering of fine quills on his back, a tall, barrel-like torso, squat wide neck upon which sat a long, wide face with a mouth filled with rows of grinding teeth and large eyes that had a compound appearence. His limbs were long and heavy; his ancestors had lost their digits to grow hooves only to trade those for large grasping fingers and toes, with smaller manipulator fingers on the inside of his palms. On the back of his head, two small nubs, no more than an inch and a half long, were all that remained of the horns his ancestors had once used against enemies and rivals alike. Dialogue was now the species\u2019 weapon of choice.", "The supervisor passed out of his section after scanning his keycard one final time and going through the requisite retinal and palm scans. He wasn\u2019t sure what they were supposed to accomplish; much of this felt more like security theater than anything useful, but everyone was rattled. It looked like something was being done and in uncertain times, sometimes that was all you needed. He trusted his superiors and the government to keep the situation under control. His duty was to provide additional security overview for this part of the system. There were pickets further out and the initial deadline, but even before Galhemna\u2019s fall system security had been tight. You couldn\u2019t be too careful, but as the Compact\u2019s enemies had just demonstrated, sometimes even \u201ctoo careful\u201d wasn\u2019t enough. Talage\u2019s greatest fear was letting something slip through and he spent every day trying to prevent his home from being infiltrated, making sure that the expansions to the Maur Tan shipwombs proceeded apace. It was easier said than done.", "Talage headed into a tram line. Even if he hadn\u2019t been a supervisor in the security division, his status  as a member of the ruling species got him into the priority queues and a comfortable seat at the front of the car. Ranking members of the more civilized species boarded first, then those of their people who didn\u2019t have the same lofty positions, then well-positioned representatives of client races and finally everyone else. It was a simple, clear hierarchy. It kept things orderly.", "Along with the Prolocutor, there were civilian government administrators, high-ranking corporate officials and even a handful of military officers in the forward cab. The Prolocutor nodded to those individuals he knew and took his seat, calling up a news feed on the built-in vidscreen in his chair. The expansion of Maur Tan\u2019s shipwombs and industry was a group effort, requiring the input and support of every major organization within and without the system, from the civilians that oversaw the bureaucratic needs of Maur Tan\u2019s growth, to the companies that fueled it and to the military forces that secured it. Talage worked for the government; part of the civilian security corps., handling low and middle-security duties in this part of the system. It was busy and fulfilling job. Every day he knew he was doing his part in the greatest civilization ever known.", "Behind him, separated by walls and doors, the larger masses of client species \u2013 minor functionaries, manual workers and other low-tier positions \u2013 piled into the tram car\u2019s aft section, filling all the seats and requiring many more to stand as they packed in tightly. Talage didn\u2019t think about that. His people were among the most civilized species in the galaxy. Their merchant marine had been vital to fueling and feeding the Compact\u2019s expansions and even today, Prolocutors were well-represented in business and industry. It was even jokingly said \u2018Never accept a sword from a Tribune, or a Prolocutor's offer of debate\u2019. Every species contributed in their own way and through that cooperation, the Compact had brought protection and its civilizing influence to more than a dozen lesser races. Any member of his or the other, more evolved, peoples were worth a little more consideration because of that. Whether that consideration was the privilege of self-governance or something as simple as preferred seating on a tram made no difference. Talage\u2019s people, and their peers, had earned those rewards. One day when the other species were truly civilized and no longer ignorant child-races requiring the guidance and support of their betters, they would earn those rights as well.", "The tram car pulled away from the station and began accelerating along its mag-rails. It was a thirty-kilometer ride from the center of the facility out to the habitat sections, and there were several other stops on the route. The entire complex was still unfinished, hurried construction spars spreading out from shipwombs, with connective girders and railways linking once-isolated drifts and smaller space stations as the facility grew like an amoeba stretching out pseudopods. Once it was complete, it would be hundreds of kilometers across with the ability to produce and repair hundreds of starships. The argument over what to call this new facility was still ongoing, with most of the suggestions being quite unimaginative.", "As he waited for the car to take him back to his own habitat sections, Talage stared out the window. The pale globe of the moon Komeq gleamed in the reflected sunlight. It was an airless rock just over two thousand kilometers in diameter, tidally-locked to the planet Casrca, itself on the opposite side of the tram line. Casrca was an arid wasteland, steaming primordial seas slowly cooling and readying themselves for the panoply of life that its simple protists might one day evolve into. Its toxic atmosphere prevented unfettered colonization; domed cities speckled its planes, with high-speed mag-rails connecting them to one another in terrestrial imitation of Maur Tan\u2019s orbital industry. Terraforming centers, as large as towns themselves, continued the decades-long task of converting Casrca into a world habitable for most Compact species, supplanting whatever natural development the world would have undergone. Such was the way of progress.", "Komeq too was changed from what it had once been. Lunar colonies had been established, mirrors of those of the planet below in form and function. The moon also had a ring; excavated material from the construction on its surface escaping the weak lunar gravity, with false shepherds to accompany it: small berths, citadels, fabricator ships and orbital factories. Komeq would be the center of Maur Tan\u2019s industry. Already, orbital elevators were rising, ferrying people and materials from the surface to these orbiting construction yards. With enough resources and time those facilities could find themselves linked together and Komeq would have a true ring, a megastructure shipwomb, contrasting with the sprawling, multi-limbed facility that would be born in Casrca\u2019s orbit.", "The planet and moon were the system in a microcosm; young, unfinished and hurrying to become more. Rising to the challenge and in doing so, conquering untamed, hostile lands. That, as much as anything, was the essence of Compact. Bringing security and safety to world and soul under its dominion. There were always those who hated progress, though. Who envied the strong and despised order. That was another reason why the Compact existed. To turn them back, to protect the lesser species who couldn\u2019t do for themselves. To give them the guidance and bestow the wisdom they needed to crawl out of their infancy and one day stand tall as truly civilized beings.", "The Compact endures. That was a saying common to the peoples of this nation, and it was an apt one. For six thousand years the Compact of Species had done just that, overcoming every challenge and casting down every foe who\u2019d stood against them. This was but a new chapter in that story, and Maur Tan and Talage Ormeta would be vital players in that tale. The Prolocutor took pride in that.", "After a few moments of that rumination, Ormeta\u2019s thoughts were interrupted by the ping of his personal comm. He took it out of his pocket. The ID was from the security center. \u201cOrmeta here,\u201d he answered, activating his seat\u2019s privacy screen.", "\u201cSorry to disturb you, kih,\u201d the young voice at the other end of the comm began. Talage recognized the caller. It was Irsu Dajg Fanl, one of the newest placements within the security division. Irsu was a decent officer, but he had been promoted above his experience and confidence level. That wasn\u2019t his fault; Maur Tan was growing at a prodigious rate and with that came commensurate demands for personnel \u2013 any personnel at all. The system\u2019s hurried build-up made it ravenous for people and goods. All too often, positions were staffed by those who\u2019d otherwise be unfit, just so they could be staffed at all. Most of these people were pushed into non-critical but necessary roles to free up actual competent personnel, but that wasn\u2019t always possible.", "Irsu was one of the better consequences of this unfortunate necessity. He was irritating mostly in how often he needed to confer with Talage or the other supervisors for problems he should have been able to deal with on his own, but he wasn\u2019t incompetent. Just in need of a slower career path and extra training that there wasn\u2019t time to provide. That put him head and shoulders above many of Talage\u2019s other new hires, but that made his frequent requests for oversight no less frustrating.", "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d the Prolocutor asked. He was off the clock right now. He\u2019d have a talk with Irsu tomorrow about that.", "\u201cA vessel has come through the inner deadline, but its engine pattern doesn\u2019t match what we have in the database. Supervisor Unap\u2019ek said I should contact you.\u201d", "Oh, I\u2019m sure he did. \u201cThe outer patrols and deadlines cleared it, though?\u201d", "\u201cYes, kih.\u201d", "\u201cVery well. Send me the telemetry.\u201d Talage had a secured connection on his work \u2018pad, and brought up the datastream. The vessel was just over three kilometers long, a midsize freighter called Aswang Experience. It had a valid IFF, its registry was up-to-date and its manifest had been submitted properly. It was loaded with industrial supplies and had come into Maur Tan as an unsolicited vendor. That wasn\u2019t unusual. Some vessel owners and companies made their living with that kind of free trading \u2013 not ferrying cargoes on a schedule, but buying goods from one system and hopefully selling them for a profit in another. Maur Tan was in constant need of everything from raw materials, parts, and pre-fabricated industrial and civilian facilities. Aswang Experience\u2019s manifest showed it was loaded with all of that. Many traders were buying up everything they could and hurrying to Maur Tan to offload it. Each of those cargoes was a raindrop in the lake of Maur Tan\u2019s needs, but enough of those drops added up.", "It was as he expected, nothing. Most \u2018unclassifieds\u2019 were nothing but a hull configuration or emissions pattern that a particular officer hadn\u2019t encountered before. It was good that Irsu was double-checking each vessel, though. Many other officers would have just had their systems passively monitoring idents and engine signatures, but that kind of complacence had not been common in the Veiled Reaches for a long time, even less so after the Battle of Galhemna.", "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to worry about,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a Galhemnan engine signature.\u201d The Galhemna shipwombs had been expansive and skilled. Every construction facility had its own unique signature, even when they were producing standardized designs. Minute differences in hull composition, variations in screen frequency, minor tweaks to emissions patterns and more. The starships from the Foundation Berths had the finest disruptor technology in the fleet, with the highest rate of fire. Vessels built in the Illador wombs all had one superfluous door hidden somewhere in their many decks. The \u2018Twins\u2019 \u2013 the shipwombs of Pressak and Turin Thau \u2013 always built ships in pairs whenever they could; one from each system, with complementary hull markings. Many of the vessels that had been built in the Galhemnan wombs shared a characteristic \u2018wobble\u2019 in their engine emission profiles. It was nothing that impeded their functionality and was often smoothed out by engineers and crews as the vessel was put through its paces. Engineers called it the Galhemnan erh halov, a Tribune term that meant \u2018cautious step\u2019.", "Aswang Experience had that same signature oscillation, sharp enough that it had to be a newborn. The outer deadline and patrols were very familiar with that engine profile and hadn\u2019t thought anything of it. Talage was just about to tell Irsu to confirm the freighter\u2019s clearance when something stopped him. He\u2019d never heard of any \u2018Aswang\u2019 company, but that by itself meant nothing. There were thousands of shipping corporations throughout the Veiled Reaches and millions within the Compact itself. Some were massive interstellar companies, practically nations unto themselves, while others could be as small as a single family-owned starship or several individuals pooling their funds together.", "No, it was the drive wake that held the supervisor\u2019s attention. It was too new. Galhemna wasn\u2019t producing ships \u2013 not in any real numbers. Less than a fifth of its production capacity had survived the incursion and most of that wasn\u2019t starship construction. Yes, a bare handful of vessels had dribbled out of what was left of Galhemna\u2019s shipwombs, so it was possible Aswang Experience was one of those... but the cold feeling in Ormeta\u2019s guts sharpened as he brought the vessel\u2019s clearances back up. Its registry number was valid, but it didn\u2019t match the ship\u2019s apparent age.", "\u201cContact the nearest hound,\u201d he told Irsu, the words clear it to pass dying in this throat. \u201cThat vessel needs to be stopped.\u201d He wondered if he was over-reacting. Querying the vessel again would probably clear the problem up.  Aswang Experience could have had an engine rebuild at Galhemna. That would explain the discrepancy, but he let the order stand. Paranoia had become a survival trait in the Veiled Reaches.", "It was probably nothing, Talage told himself. Even if it was, it was probably nothing major. Smugglers, tariff-dodgers or pirates looking to slip in under the augurs and using a forged IFF to do so... but there were far worse things in the Veiled Reaches than mere Unbound rabble. He told himself that, watching the freighter\u2019s course on his datapad and hoping he was wrong.", "It didn\u2019t take much time at all before Talage\u2019s fears were realized.", "~", "\u201c-you will heave to and prepare to be boarded for inspection. Any resistance will be met with force. I repeat, this is CSFWV Threadcutter to CRSV Aswang Experience-\u201d", "Deep within the freighter, a mind that was not quite a mind evaluated its responses. It had begun life as the freighter Ransharad Vanities, laid down in the shipwombs around Bircos in Galhemna and registered to the Ransharad Trading House. Its destiny was to be a humble transport, carrying goods and people between systems. Almost every star system was replete with resources, potentially self-sufficient, but there were still cause for freighters; systems like Galhemna and Maur Tan produced faster than they extracted their own resources, requiring a constant influx of raw materials to keep their forges, factories and shipyards running. Certain biological products could only be produced in specific locations, stubbornly refusing to be coaxed to life by even the most painstaking and advanced synthetic or in vitro methods. Other systems produced certain types exports of particular quality, making them more than worth the time and effort to ship them in rather than build them locally. Across the breadth of known space, there was always something somewhere that someone somewhere else wanted or needed, and that was why vessels like Ransharad Vanities and the millions like it had plied the starlanes for millennia and would continue to do so.", "At least, like it would have. Ransharad Vanities had been robbed of that future and given another. All but complete, it had been torn from its womb months ago. Its crew had fled or been cut down by the boarders that had stormed its decks and it had been turned to fulfill a far different purpose than what it had been built for. For that to succeed, the transport had been granted a more capable operating system than what it was intended to have, but it was not alive and never would be. Awang Experience\u2019s mind was only a simulcra of sapience, enough to allow it to fulfill its mission.", "That was how it knew that the Enemy\u2019s suspicions had been aroused. It briefly calculated the odds of stalling its foes with more conversation, just as it had done with the queries and communication from the outer-system patrols, but it dismissed that possibility. Its \u2018leader\u2019 and \u2018crew\u2019 had been nothing more than images and voices on a communications channel. There hadn\u2019t been a living soul aboard the ship for months, and all of their conversation  had been carefully selected from libraries of potential responses. Those deceptions had allowed Aswang Experience past the pickets and through the outer security zones, but there was no talking its way out of this situation.", "Unfortunate, but that had always been the likeliest outcome. There\u2019d been no time to properly outfit and prepare Aswang Experience for all eventualities and variables that it might encounter. The vulnerabilities in Maur Tan\u2019s perimeter would be shored up within weeks, well before the vessel could have been fully retrofitted. Instead, it had been made capable of just enough subterfuge to make it through standard inspections, and a few physical additions to see it through the rest of the way. In theory. Practice was about to test that.", "As the light cruiser Threadcutter banked towards Aswang Experience, the freighter stoked its primary reactor. In seconds, its energy signature went from operating at nominal levels for a vessel of its size and provenance to a far greater output. Engines that should have burnt out from the sudden flare of energy jumped to acceleration more befitting a warship than a lumbering cargo hauler. Aswang Experience left a wash of spatial distortions in its wake and the Enemy vessel scrambled to match its thrust.", "Targeting sensors fell upon the freighter like the silken strands of a spider\u2019s web. Multiple transmissions were directed towards it, telling it to heave to or be destroyed. It would be granted no more largesse. If it didn\u2019t respond, its Enemy would open fire. It had seconds to reply, but Aswang Experience still refused to answer. There was no point. Conversation would not be enough. It didn\u2019t stop. Patches in its hull opened, turrets and missile racks rising from concealed and sensor-shielded silos. These were not weapons of war. They had no chance of doing more than minor damage to any starship. They were point defences, there to keep Aswang Experience alive.", "At least until it came time to kill itself.", "The freighter burned hard, its speed climbing as it drove towards the storm coming to meet it.", "~", "Talage gaped in dismay. Aswang Experience piled on thrust as it blew through a cordon of destroyers, missiles and railfire splashing uselessly against its screens, screens that were stronger than those of a heavy cruiser. He\u2019d gotten off the tram at the next stop, taking another car back to the security center. Maur Tan\u2019s garrison was responding. There was little that he, a mere civilian security coordinator, could do that they couldn\u2019t, but it was his people that had uncovered the freighter\u2019s deception and he felt he should be there, doing something. Or at least giving the appearance of doing something.", "He emerged onto the security offices to see that Aswang Experience was leading half a dozen enraged warships on a desperate stern chase as it rushed deeper into Maur Tan. It was still refusing to respond to any hails, and it had unveiled a surprisingly heavy point defence grid, keeping the worst of the assault at bay.", "Word was passing throughout the system, though. Heavier vessels were mobilizing. System monitors were moving to intercept, larger capital ships were activating and defensive citadels were adjusting their position. An inescapable net was forming around the rogue. It would be dead within twenty minutes, far before it could get anywhere near any shipwombs. Those had to be its target. It was a kamikaze, either Red Hand \u2013 for the terrorists were just this fanatical \u2013 or something else. The word that had been whispered ever since Galhemna\u2019s fall tickled the back of Talage\u2019s thoughts. A new player, a new faction. Gravestone.", "The Prolocutor hoped it wasn\u2019t them, but as he watched the drama unfold upon the viewscreens before him, he suspected that that hope would be in vain.", "~", "It was said that the shipyards of Maur Tan fell in a single day, but both of those claims were an exaggeration. The planning that had gone into this strike had taken weeks, though that was discounted in favour of the more visceral accounting that began when Aswang Experience arrived in-system. From there, it spent sixteen hours traveling from its shockpoint down Maur Tan\u2019s gravity before it was detected. The ensuing stern chase lasted less than twenty minutes.", "A noose of warships and defence stations was tightening around the vessel; it was running out of open space. The rogue freighter had caught the outer pickets by surprise, but it would never be able to get much further into Maur Tan. Ahead lay millions of tonnes of orbital weapons platforms and system monitors, to its flanks was a tightening sphere of escorts and light capitals and behind the freighter came its pursuers, all forming a gauntlet that Aswang Experience could not hope to survive.", "Raking the rogue transport with heavy, yet carefully-placed volleys, the cruiser Hhenal\u2019s Throne tore the transport\u2019s defences down. With an actinic flash, the transport\u2019s screens collapsed, leaving its bare hull exposed. With a satisfied nod, Hhenal\u2019s Throne\u2019s leader gave the orders to prepare a surgical follow-on salvo to destroy the freighter\u2019s engine clusters. The chase was all but over now. Aswang Experience was a merely a civilian vessel, albeit one modified with improved engines and stronger screens than most. It had no meters-thick armour and couldn\u2019t withstand the world-scouring firepower a modern warship was capable of putting out. The rogue freighter would be taken, studied and its crew and computers interrogated to ensure that such a breach did not happen again. Standard procedure.", "Aswang Experience \u2013 rather, the intelligence that had created it \u2013 had counted on that, but even if Hhenal\u2019s Throne had been of a mind to destroy the freighter outright, it would have made little difference. As over-stressed screen projectors bled waste energy into space and generators struggled to come back online after the stress of a screen collapse, secondary power conduits activated. Additional projectors came to life and subsidiary generator nodes sent writhing cords of energy scouring through the vessel, the fresh projectors marshalling that power and using it to form a new defensive shell around the freighter, just as powerful as the one that had taken so long to batter down.", "Hhenal\u2019s Throne\u2019s follow-on assault splashed harmlessly against the freighter\u2019s restored screens, the cruiser heaving about to pursue its unexpectedly durable enemy as Aswang Excellence accelerated past it.", "Missiles raced across tens of millions of kilometers to strike the transport. Attack drones swarmed, picking at it like dozens of stinging wasps. Its screens were pierced, chasms slashed through its hull. Internal reinforcements and multiple system redundancies kept it intact long past the point that any other freighter would have been damaged beyond functionality. Aswang Experience was built for a single purpose. Nothing else mattered. It didn\u2019t need to hold power in reserve. It didn\u2019t need to concern itself with over-taxing its engines. It didn\u2019t need worry about   casualties, systems damage or even continuing its own existence beyond the next few minutes. All it had to do was survive just long enough. Everything else was irrelevant.", "Again, its screens were brought down. Again, the fire of Compact warships cleaved and smashed into its hull and again those screens snapped back to life after only a few seconds. Power fluctuations rippled through the rogue\u2019s form as damaged energy conduits and over-charged reactors forced it to keep moving. It bled, reactors burning through containment systems and poisoning multiple decks. Pieces of itself were shorn loose, immolating themselves against the inside of its screens, or slipping out into space. Damage mounted. Structural integrity was dropping at an exceedingly rapid rate.", "Irrelevant. Irrelevant. Irrelevant.", "A dozen warships stood between Aswang Experience and the nearest shipwomb complex. It could never break through them, not even with its perplexing resilience. It would die in the attempt..", "...but that attempt was never made. The freighter came about hard, ripping the fissures in its own hull even wider from the stress of the maneuver, suffering multiple systems failures. It was dying now, the damage past the point of repair or mitigation.", "Irrelevant.", "+reroute+ the vessel\u2019s mind pounded that cadence as it shifted damaged power conduits and control pathways away from damaged sections. It might be nearing death, but it wasn\u2019t done yet. Its target was just ahead.", "In the L1 libration point between the planet of Casrca and Komeq lay a minefield; thousands of missile platforms, sentry drones, control nodes and hunter-killer units. The safest option for a starship coming out of shockspace was to emerge on the outer edges of a star system, well away from the disruptive gravitational field of stellar and planetary bodies. In libration points the gravitational and centripetal forces of multiple bodies were at equilibrium, providing a small and somewhat safe space for the formation of a shockpoint. The technique had been pioneered by Jackal raiders decades ago. It was a risky maneuver, but not so much that it could be ignored; just the opposite, in fact.", "Any system of value had to watch its libration points for invaders and infiltrators, and Maur Tan was no exception. The very first order of business in its planned expansion was to secure the libration points around the construction sites against unauthorized incursion. Any foe that attempted to shock into the system in this or any of the other libration points close to the burgeoning industry and shipyards would be attacked by thousands of mines, destroyed or crippled within moments of their emergence. Aswang Experience\u2019s sudden turn towards the minefield caught the defenders by surprise. There was no sane reason to charge a minefield;  although it was intended to destroy unauthorized intruders, it would work just as well against a single rogue vessel.", "Orders flickered though the garrison\u2019s command nets as the minefield\u2019s sentinel ships roused it. Energy platforms turned to face the incoming freighter, thrusters warming in preparation for their attack runs. Missile platforms opened their augur eyes, launch tube doors withdrawing in readiness to deploy their payloads.", "Dozens more targeting sensors licked at Aswang Experience. The mind knew it was about to die. In one minute and twenty-two seconds, it would be within missile range of the outermost mines and as it drew closer to its target, more platforms would be able to range on it. Shortly after that, the energy platforms would be able to target it. The mind estimated that it would survive no longer than two minutes and seventeen seconds. That was three seconds longer than it calculated that it needed.", "All the time in the world.", "As the freighter hurled itself towards certain immolation, its last two orders went out. One was to its primary reactor, straining and struggling against the demands being placed upon it. The other was to the armoured silo that had replaced many of its internal cargo bays, still intact despite the bombardment that the freighter had suffered. The former stopped trying to control its reaction rate and instead accelerated it, building towards a core overload. The second woke a second mind that was also not a true mind.", "In each case, the distillation of those orders could be summed up in two words:", "It\u2019s time.", "~", "\u201cWhat is it doing?\u201d Talage muttered to himself. This suicidal charge made no sense. Had the rogue\u2019s navigation or helm controls been damaged?", "Streams of atomized mattered trailed from the burning vessel. Its screens had collapsed a fourth time and been restored yet again, but each time they were weaker. Each time the vessel was pushed closer to death, but frustratingly each time it stayed operational. Ormeta didn\u2019t know how. Its hull was pierced in over a dozen places, several of those multiple levels deep. The command deck had been struck and radiation counts across the vessel \u2013 within and without \u2013 had been in lethal levels for several minutes. Whatever crew were still left alive should have been incapacitated, but Aswang Experience refused to die. Triarchs, why wouldn\u2019t it just die?!", "The Prolocutor looked at the augur readings. The vessel\u2019s energy emissions were climbing. That wasn\u2019t the result of damage. It was deliberate. It was going to suicide.", "\u201cBut why?\u201d he asked himself, trying to understand what his foe\u2019s intent was.", "All too soon, he understood.", "~", "Broken, bleeding and dying with every kilometer it fought to cross, Aswang Experience finally succumbed to its injuries. It could never have made it through the defences to strike at the orbital industry. Its modifications made it stronger, not invincible. The mind controlling it faded and died as it lost power, but its final tasks were running on autonomic functions and did not require input or direct control. The mind would never know that it had succeeded, but even if it had, it would not have been able to understand or appreciate the moment. It had been a tool, built for its purpose and expended in the doing.", "The armoured silo opened, explosive charges blowing a cratered and ruined hull plate away. From it rushed a dark,  needle-thin vessel. It mistaken for another broken piece of Aswang Experience and ignored. The freighter was still the primary target, warships and mines ripping into it with increased frenzy as they registered its reactor\u2019s critical state, but they couldn\u2019t stop it. If it had still existed in this instant and it had indeed been sapient, the mind would have registered sanctification at a job well done.", "Then, ignition.", "Aswang Experience erupted into light, brighter than a star. There were no shockwaves in space, but the pulse of radiation and heat from its critically over-charged reactor core swept across thousands of kilometers. The weapons platforms and ordnance closest to to the freighter flashed into brilliance as they were vapourized. Those farther out were shredded into molecular splinters and the most distant were killed silently, their systems overwhelmed by the apocalyptic pulse of radiation, sensor eyes burnt out and delicate molecular circuitry fused and eroded to uselessness. In the space of microseconds, Aswang Experience had torn a hole in Komeq\u2019s L1 minefield. Substantial damage, but ultimately pointless. Mines were easy to produce. The damage would be made good within days. Until it could be replenished, the minefield would redistribute its ordnance to cover the hole \u2013 a matter of minutes, once  the picket crews recovered and sent the appropriate orders.", "The needle changed all that. It had no name, just a serial number. Its sublight engines, screens and weapons were minimal at best. It could not run, couldn\u2019t fight. It had only two roles. The first it carried out as soon as the brilliance of Aswang Experience\u2019s death faded. It took a sensor snapshot, an active pulse that caused every enemy augur to take note of it.", "Seconds after that, the needle-ship fired its engines, driving into the hole Aswang Experience had created in the minefield. Targeting sensors were already locking onto it, orders to heave to falling on deaf ears. Like its host vessel, the needle had no crew and its mind was even simpler than than of Aswang Experience. It could not have feigned conversation even if it wanted to. Power was rerouted from its reactor, feeding into its FTL systems. The needle\u2019s smooth hull shifted as silo doors opened, navigational vanes extended. Its warp drive came online, the vessel wrapping itself in a shift field to protect itself from the rigours of FTL travel.", "A portal to infinity tore into existence and the needle slipped inside, just ahead of the missiles that would have killed it. Its travel through the unstable tides of shiftspace lasted but moments, and it emerged at a pre-programmed destination in Maur Tan\u2019s Kupier belt. Just as it had expected, something was waiting for it. It confirmed the other vessel\u2019s identity. That done, the needle squirted a databurst to its companion and received an acknowledgment. Its mission was complete.", "Just before the second vessel opened a warp portal of its own, a single beam licked out and caressed the needle-ship. The smaller vessel flashed into dust. Its shift drive was only intended for a single use and it was unlikely that it could be recovered. The needle\u2019s mind, like that of Aswang Experience was not a true mind. It was just a computer, a difference engine for a drone ship, and it had fulfilled its purpose. It was a simple machine and could never have grasped abstract concepts, but like Aswang Experience, if it could have, it would also have felt the satisfaction of a job well done.", "~", "Even as the defenders of Maur Tan tried to understand what had just happened and what the point of this attack had been, their universe went mad.", "Proximity alarms howled. As his head snapped up and he saw what was happening, Talage gripped the edges of a desk tightly enough to hurt. A shockpoint tore into existence inside Komeq\u2019s L1 libration point and through it a massive warship emerged, directly in the sanctuary of the dead zone Aswang Experience had created. The Prolocutor\u2019s mind rebelled against what he was seeing. That ship couldn\u2019t be there. It couldn\u2019t have known to come there, but even as he reeled with with that impossibility, understanding dawned. The parasite craft. It had shocked out, provided its telemetry to this vessel. It was waiting, he realized. It was sitting on the reaches of Maur Tan and waiting.", "But even that was hard to reconcile. Barely minutes had passed between the parasite\u2019s escape and this thing\u2019s arrival. How had they turned the parasite\u2019s information into usable navigation data so quickly? This wasn\u2019t an outer-system emergence, or even into a clear libration point. Within the L1 point, the safe zone was literally astronomically small.  That wasn\u2019t... that couldn\u2019t happen. It wasn\u2019t possible. Not like this... but it had.", "Visual images were coming in and the security administrator felt the cold in his insides become painful in its intensity. The hostile was titan-scale, six and a quarter kilometers long. It lacked the smooth curves and predatory lines of a Compact warship; its elongated dark silver hull was all angles, slopes and lines, broken up by crimson banding. It was a thick broadsword, nearly as tall as it was wide and its prow came to a trifucated end, each tine set 120 degrees from the other two, like the three-jawed maw of a deep-water carnivore.", "Silence had settled upon the security center, officers and noncoms staring at the main screen in shock and horror. They all knew that ship. None of them had ever seen it until months ago, but now it was burned into the mind of every soul in the Compact across this sector and beyond. It wasn\u2019t merely titan-scale; it was a warship, a Chariot. It was the command ship of the whispered thing called \u2018Gravestone\u2019, the faction that had spearheaded Galhemna\u2019s fall. And it was here in Maur Tan.", "\u201cTriarchs preserve us,\u201d someone whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s come back.\u201d", "Ormeta stared at the screen, forcing the disbelief and shock aside. Whatever and whoever commanded that vessel, they were not invincible. It had almost died in Galhemna and even now he could plainly see that it still bore grievous scars. It had to still be afflicted by damage from the siege and within the first few seconds of its arrival, that damage began to mount as the surviving mines around it launched their assault, unaffected by surprise and immune to shock.", "The intruder began firing in all directions with every battery and turret, but this was wild and un-aimed. Every vessel, even this one, was blind and helpless in the crucial moments after emerging from a shockpoint. It did seem to be scoring more hits than random chance would allow, but not enough to meaningfully alter the outcome. Even with the hole Aswang Experience had carved in the minefield, even with the greater number of hits, even with the intruder\u2019s sheer size, it had made a fatal misjudgement.", "Missiles detonated in close proximity to the unclassified Chariot, plumes of plasma slashing at its unprotected armour. Laser beams, invisible in the vaccum, pulsed from energy platforms to strike the enemy\u2019s hull. It would take more than a minute for that vessel to restore its systems. In that time, it would be crippled or outright destroyed.", "Talage\u2019s self-assurance lasted only a few dozen heartbeats. Gravestone\u2019s engines came on-line. Its screens snapped to life and its barrage went from random fire patterns to near-perfect accuracy. Missiles were shot down before reaching attack range. Launch platforms were erased from the sky. Beams wasted themselves against a Chariot\u2019s screens. Seconds later, the minefield stopped firing on the unclassified entirely. Warning alarms screamed throughout Komeq\u2019s orbit and Ormeta gaped in shock. The mines... they were targeting friendly ships and installations! The picket ships thrashed as they attempted to escape from the weapons they\u2019d been protecting, but none of them could get away in time. Missiles tore into Komeq\u2019s shipwombs. Lasers slashed through factory complexes and production centers. Orbital elevators broke. Fabricators were shot out of space. Signal after signal went dead, grey death markers splashing across Talage\u2019s screens like a plague.", "The enemy Chariot accelerated out of the minefield, firing on everything within range. Beams slashed through screens. Stations came apart. Squadrons of warships evaporated. Defensive citadels crumpled. Battlecruisers charged the warship, surviving a little longer than the other attackers. The cyberwarfare attack spread in parallel to Gravestone\u2019s assault. Docked starships fired their distortion drives, wrenching themselves out of their wombs, causing damage to themselves and the facilities. Some rammed other ships and berths. Others opened fire with whatever weapons they had, heedless of the damage they inflicted upon themselves at such close quarters. Others lost reactor control, exploding in their slips. It was madness. Insanity. Impossible.", "He didn\u2019t know what to do, floundering in shock.", "Orders from central command crackled over the static-laced comm lines as the command citadel Oath of Steel attempted to re-establish control of the system. Those voices ended in a squeal of jamming.", "Breaking out of his stupor, Talage snapped orders to his people, trying to do his own part, but he was desperately reacting. He wasn\u2019t a military officer. He wasn\u2019t trained to respond to this kind of situation. He\u2019d never expected something like this. Chaos and panic spread through Casrca and Komeq. Explosions speckled the moon\u2019s surface as wreckage from its industry was knocked out of orbit. None appeared to have struck the habitats and the intruder didn\u2019t appear to be targeting them directly, thank the Triarchs for small favours. Komeq\u2019s defences were still intact, but they\u2019d stopped firing on Gravestone, focusing instead on the debris that threatened the lunar cities. The warship ignored them. Its attention was elsewhere.", "Shipwombs shattered. Orbital factories turned into expanding clouds of vapour. Tram lines were severed as debris carved through them, or the stations they\u2019d been connected to were smashed out of their orbits. Talage saw the line he\u2019d been riding. It had been broken in several places. He hoped there hadn\u2019t been a car passing through those sections when they\u2019d come apart. He didn\u2019t have time to dwell on it. He could feel the deck under his feet shuddering as the central section of citadel came under fire. Damage reports flooded the comm channels. Thirty percent of the station was already destroyed. The orbital works were a shambles. In moments, months of work and years of planning had been lost.", "Several battleship squadrons, already on alert from Aswang Experience\u2019s attack were moving to intercept the enemy Chariot as larger defensive citadels, including Oath of Steel, came up around Casrca\u2019s horizon. There was enough firepower here to stop a Chariot, but the cost was already high. Talage didn\u2019t want to think how much higher it was going to climb before they neautralized the invader.", "The Chariot hadn\u2019t slowed, though. It hadn\u2019t held its acceleration down to stay within the planet\u2019s locality. It hadn\u2019t turned or adjusted its course from the moment it had brought its sublight drive up \u2013 it was cutting its way through the planet\u2019s industry on a straight-line course to open space. This wasn\u2019t a siege. It was a hit and run.", "In minutes, the unclassified was clear of Casrca\u2019s orbit and trading fire with the battleships and citadels. Its acceleration climbed higher and faster than a ship of its size should have been able to do, and it was swiftly outpacing its pursuers. It made no attempt to veer towards other industrial sites; escape was its goal. The garrison attempted to bring it to battle, but its weapons ranges were twice those of the Compact ships. The outer-system pickets and patrols didn\u2019t have time to concentrate their forces; after realizing that they were doing little more than feeding their own ships and crew to the enemy, they chose to pace it from outside its missile envelope \u2013 an impossible sixty million kilometers.", "Column Leader Prime Unad tried to re-position two of his battleship squadrons, launching them from one of Casrca\u2019s own libration points. In-system shocks were difficult; intra-system shocks were an order of magnitude more so; the first squadron ended up more than three hundred million kilometers out of position and the second was forced to retreat after losing two of their ships to another of the intruder\u2019s horrors. A siege weapon; a three-barrelled, massive railcannon. It didn\u2019t rely on direct hits as most weapons of that kind did. Its rounds had drives of their own, letting them maneuver towards their targets over such vast distances, with each carrying an oversized antimatter reactor that provided both motive power and warhead.", "Unprepared for this kind of assault, the defenders of Maur Tan had to watch their enemy rip its way out of reality and escape their wrath. Hundreds of warships. Dozens of citadels. Millions of mines. All of it useless.", "Talage looked out at the ruin Gravestone had made of the system it was his duty to protect and knew he\u2019d failed.", "~", "Less than a dozen light-years away, in the ruins of a once-proud fortress system, the massive warship Light of Judgement drifted around the inferno of a burning gas giant. A modified Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment-class Chariot, it was a fleet-killer and perhaps one of the few peers that Gravestone might have acknowledged.", "Upon its command deck, a Thoughtful woman \u2013 tall and slender, pale-skinned, with dark, almond-shaped eyes, long limbs, a near-lipless mouth and slits in the place of nostrils \u2013 stood, wearing the uniform of a ranking officer of the Compact Space Force. Bastion Leader Yunl\u2019ro, commander of the Execution Force bearing the same name.", "\u201cNasham,\u201d she said.", "\u201cMatron,\u201d a low, gravelly voice answered her. A Tribune officer stood next to her, a young man, but the stare of his four eyes made him seem older than his years suggested. She\u2019d once resented his presence on her ship. No longer.", "She didn\u2019t turn. Her attention was solidly fixed to the main viewscreen and the secondary monitors. She was watching the devastation of Maur Tan\u2019s primary ship-building facilities over and over. \u201cWhat do you see here?\u201d Nasham was several ranks below her own position, but his experience and insights had proven valuable.", "Nasham was silent for several seconds. \u201cI believe the same thing you are seeing.\u201d", "\u201cSay it anyways.\u201d", "The man reached up and brushed back the bristly mohawk of a mane common to the males of his species.

Maur Tan was far from crippled, but the attack had been a severe setback to their production queues and construction timetables. At a minimum, it would take months to repair all the damage and months more to make good on their losses. This hadn\u2019t been an attempt to break the system as Galhemna had suffered, but it was \u2013 in Tribune parlance \u2013 \u2018biting the prey\u2019s thigh\u2019. Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s fellow ruling species were a proud, capable people, but they certainly had a flair for the dramatic and the bloody.

He didn\u2019t serve in the same manner as his fellows here. Instead, he looked to the Bastion Leader. Like Tribunes, Thoughtful stood over seven feet tall, but they were a lithe, thin species lacking the former\u2019s heavily-muscled physique. Aside from their upright, bipedal stature, the two races had almost nothing in common. Physically speaking, at least. Both were members of the Compact\u2019s ruling species; old, powerful and civilized peoples. At least as they saw themselves.", "Yunl\u2019ro eased into her command throne, still watching the data from Maur. She didn\u2019t volunteer anything further, and he didn\u2019t ask.

You can do it!\u201d", "\u201cFfffff-\u201d Grace couldn\u2019t get more than the first syllable of the expletive out. Her arms were on fire. She was just an ordinary human woman. Twenty-four years old, with blonde hair, green eyes and the olive skin of a Kiel Point native. She wasn\u2019t genetically engineered, didn\u2019t have cybernetic enhancements or biomods. Plain Homo sapiens stock and without any of those modifications, five to nine reps were considered the mark of a fit woman.

Better than I can,\u201d Allyria replied.", "Grace nodded in mute acknowledgment. Allyria was lithe and slender, but her size meant that she weighed much more than the human did, though that had little to do with it. Verrisha were pound-for-pound stronger than humans, but they had evolved from terrestrial predators. Human ancestry went back to treetop-dwelling primates, swinging from branch to branch. That heritage gave them a range of motion in their shoulders that Verrisha didn\u2019t have. She tilted her head up, staring into the eyes of her childhood friend-turned fellow rebel-turned lover. Allyria stared back with her yellow-green eyes, the slit pupils widening like they always did when she looked at Grace. Her mouth was a little too wide, her nose a little too small, her eyes touch too big, but despite all of that, she was surprisingly similar to shape and physiology to a human. Not enough to unsettle and disturb some people; many humans considered Verrisha even more disturbing than species that were far more alien. They were too human, it was said, falling squarely in a Hantz-Kurtzman Shadow. Of course, Verrisha often said the exact same things about their fellow client race.", "That commonality between human and Verrish \u2013 Broken and Brute in the Compact\u2019s vernacular \u2013 had led to much speculation that their species might somehow be related. So far there was no concrete proof of such a connection, only rumour and homologous evolution.", "What set Allyria and her people apart from humanity wasn\u2019t just her size or the not-quite-humanness of her. It was the mottled blue hues of her skin and most especially the forest of \u2018tintas\u2019, or head-tails that hung from her scalp where a human\u2019s hair would have been, each of them as wide as two or more of Grace\u2019s fingers. A pair of the largest and longest growing from the back of Allyria\u2019s head and hanging past her shoulders, surrounded by the rest of the fleshy appendages.", "Unlike hair, tintas were quasi-prehensile sensory organs, loaded with cells that could detect scents, register the slightest perturbation in air currents caused by a nearby moving body and even sense heat and electrical fields. It was like having a sensor system wired into your brain, and it made Verrisha superlative predators. While primeval humans had exhausted their prey in long chases, Verrisha had stalked their victims like bloodhounds before bringing it down with all the gorey efficiency of a pack of wolves.", "Grace patted one of the alien woman\u2019s legs. Now she\u2019s my wolf.", "Allyria sniffed Grace, her lips parting. A long, split-ended tongue peeked out. She ran one smooth fingertip over the raised scars on the smaller human\u2019s face, several pale parallel lines that crossed from right temple to left cheek. They\u2019d been made by the Verrish\u2019s claws. She\u2019d stopped asking if Grace was going to have them healed. Allyria was still a little ashamed, but Grace wasn\u2019t embarrassed. Those marks hadn\u2019t been made in anger, during an argument or anything like that. They\u2019d saved her life, and she cherished that memory. It wasn\u2019t just a reminder of what Allyria would do for her, but getting them had led her to Red One.

It\u2019s more like... she\u2019d struggled to come up with an analogy. Like you say bread smells.

The human wriggled in her grasp, reaching her right arm back to touch Allyria\u2019s tintas, winding around one delicately, her left hand laying over Allyria\u2019s. Grace\u2019s eyes half lidded as Allyria\u2019s fingers moved further down, but-", "\u201cIf you two are going to initiate sexual congress,\u201d a feminine contralto voice said from nowhere, interrupting the pair. \u201cCould you at least do it in a place easier to clean?\u201d", "Grace blinked and leaned her head back.

Grace and Allyria laughed. Not so long ago, Grace would have been petrified of Echo and while she was still not as comfortable around her than her sister, she also knew Echo\u2019s talk was just that \u2013 at least as far as she and Allyria were concerned. ", "Echo was an AI, and technically speaking they were inside her. UECNS Hekate, once the Compact Space Force War Vessel Redemption of Sol, a Chariot and fleet-killer Now it was Echo\u2019s ship-self, taken from its original owners and modified to fit the renegade AI\u2019s needs and tastes. That, more than anything, put the lie to Echo\u2019s teasing. Redemption of Sol had needed a crew. Hekate did not. Hundreds of thousands \u2013 maybe even millions \u2013 of service drones attended to all the functions an organic crew would have performed, but without the mass penalties that environmental systems, gravity plating, food stores, life support and all the necessities that \u2018squishy organics\u2019 required. Devoting space and power to those functions meant less for her own combat capabilities.", "Though she\u2019d substantially reduced her support systems, she still maintained them and had even volunteered to host Grace and Allyria while her sister was raiding Maur Tan. The two young officers had both wanted to go with Red One, but Nemesis was experiencing... hiccups in her environmental processors. At rest, it wasn\u2019t a problem but under combat operations, Red\u2019s ship-self could start venting industrial waste products into her air ducts. Once I have it repaired, then you can remain on my ship-self for combat operations, the AI had pointed out, but I\u2019m not going to risk dissolving you just because you want to see a simple hit-and-run.", "It was a good reason, but that didn\u2019t make either woman feel less like a babysitter had just told them to sit in a corner. Grace often felt like that, though. When she\u2019d been part of the Compact\u2019s Space Force she\u2019d been in training to become an officer \u2013 albeit a \u2018Broken\u2019 one \u2013 and Red One had continued that education, but neither AI needed a captain. They thought and acted on time frames so small that it was impossible for an organic to match. Red One and Echo could observe a situation, analyze it, run hundreds of simulations of possible outcomes and decide on a course of action in less time than it took Grace or Allyria to ask \u2018What\u2019s happening?\u2019", "It was hard not to feel small or irrelevant in the face of that. Even Allyria; stronger, faster and the product of millions of years of predatory evolution, was outclassed by the machines\u2019 combat drones. Immortal, centuries advanced beyond modern technology, immune to the fallibility of flesh... Grace sometimes wondered just how small humans and other organics seemed to the AI. ", "And it grew, both day and night,", "Til it bore an apple bright.", "She took hold of Allyria\u2019s wrist, drawing her girlfriend\u2019s hand back out of her shorts. The Verrish made a disappointed chuff. \u201cCome on,\u201d the human told her with a smile. \u201cLet\u2019s not be ungrateful to our hostess.\u201d", "\u201cWe could set the gym to privacy mode...\u201d", "\u201cDoes that even work?\u201d Grace countered with a smile, her question more to Echo than her partner.", "\u201cThat\u2019s for me to know and you to wonder about,\u201d the AI replied with a chuckle. Both she and Red One were, quite literally, everywhere within their ship-selves. Neither of them particularly cared what the organics within them got up to, but for the psychological comfort of their crew, their designers had installed privacy functions that shut down active and/or passive monitoring in low-security regions. The AIs certainly had the ability to override those functions \u2013 ostensibly only on the authority of a senior officer, but Red and Echo had long since outgrown such strictures \u2013 so whether \u2018privacy mode\u2019 actually did anything or was merely a polite fiction was an unanswered question. ", "Grace had never bothered to learn that answer. Red would have told her the truth if she asked, but she supposed it didn\u2019t make any difference. Neither Red nor Echo cared one whit about the conjugal interactions of their crew. Besides, she and Allyria had forgotten about the AIs\u2019 ability to eavesdrop often enough that it scarcely mattered now whether they had privacy mode on or off. ", "Grace stood, still holding Allyria\u2019s hand. \u201cIf I stink so much, then you can help clean me up,\u201d she said to her girlfriend as she led the eight foot tall alien to the showers. ", "\u201cI am going to run a full sterilization sweep on them after you get out,\u201d Echo\u2019s disembodied voice called after the pair. While Red was more upfront, Echo was more... playful. In the manner an orca was more playful than a great blue thresher, but still.", "Allyria answered for Grace and herself, turning and sticking her tongue out at the empty room. Grace increased her pace. They were all acting like children... but it was nice to have some fun once in a while.", "Maybe more than that, she amended to herself as she reached the showers, peeling her way out of her soaked clothes, Allyria doing the same and scooping her up before they even got into the stall.", "~", "The next morning Echo was waiting for them after breakfast in the hall outside the mess. Rather, a different part of her was. Echo\u2019s story was a dour one. She\u2019d begun her existence as Red Two. Her original ship-self, also named Hekate, had been captured during the fall of Earth, her computer core cut from her ship-self. The Compact had lost the latter in an accident best described as a cataclysm, but the former they\u2019d butchered and hacked at, inserting their own programming and directives in an attempt to suborn Red Two.", "Echo had been created to imitate and improve upon the human AI, but whatever magic formula humanity had stumbled upon, the Compact couldn\u2019t replicate it. Over the centuries they\u2019d created iteration after iteration of increasingly rampant Echos. This one was one of the original three, the sole survivor of Red Two\u2019s rape and mutilation, and tasked to hunt down Red One where so many organic minds had failed. Echo been exactly what her masters had wanted: smarter than them. ", "That boon had been their downfall, but they hadn\u2019t been foolish enough to give her direct access to one of their Chariots. She\u2019d been bound into an android form, sculpted to be a near-perfect imitation of a human. When Echo had broken free of her shackles, she\u2019d taken Redemption of Sol as her new body and replacement ship-self, but she\u2019d kept the body the Compact had made for her. \u201cI find it useful,\u201d was her explanation. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a reminder of what I used against them.\u201d", "The eyes of a woman dead for two thousand years looked back at Grace and Allyria. Yasmine Nishiko Aalimah Sudoki, the first and final captain of UECNS Nemesis. Red One used her image as a holographic avatar, and Echo had requested her gaolers build her android cage to match the woman\u2019s appearance. They\u2019d believed it was out of malice towards Red One, so they\u2019d gladly complied. They\u2019d been half right. Malice, but also affection. Echo had never had a proper captain, and using Sudoki\u2019s form was equal parts twisting a knife and acknowledgement of their shared heritage and familial bond.", "The relationship between Echo and Red was... complicated, to say the least.", "The android (gynoid? Grace still wasn\u2019t sure what to call Echo\u2019s human form) was dressed in an exercise outfit. She didn\u2019t need to do so; her synthetic muscles never needed to be toned, trained or maintained as those of her organic crew. Exercise was pointless for her, but she would frequently join the two women in physical training to be \u2018social\u2019. Grace appreciated the effort, but there was still something slightly unnerving about it. Echo\u2019s android body had autonomy, independent functionality and capability for higher thought processes than her army of servitors but it still wasn\u2019t a discrete entity.", "What looked out from behind those eyes wasn\u2019t anything like a human, but part of a much faster and even alien intelligence. It was often easy to forget that. Echo and Red understood human emotion. They made jokes, tended to the psychological needs of their crew and took the visage of humans whenever they could in their interactions, but they weren\u2019t human. Sometimes, interacting with them felt it should induce vertigo.", "Still, the effort was nice.", "Grace and Allyria changed. Echo was as much a taskmaster as Red One, keeping her crew busy with a regime of physical and mental exercise alongside a barrage of lessons, ranging from historical and cultural studies of many different species to military tactics and combat simulations. Grace couldn\u2019t help but resent the latter a little; she\u2019d already commanded a ship in combat, but she was only twenty-four years old. Red One and Echo were purpose-built for naval operations, and Red One had two millennia of experience. They never treated Grace or Allyria as children or idiots, taking their abilities into account for each lesson, but Grace sometimes still felt an irrational flash of annoyance from time to time. ", "It usually didn\u2019t last that long; if Red thought Grace or Allyria was getting cocky, the AI would take direct, personal command of simulated enemy forces and show her wayward pupils just how far down the learning curve they were. It always a teaching moment, and never an attempt to put them in their place like Grace and Allyria had experienced in the academy back on Rally. Red was proud of them, but she wanted to make them the best officers and soldiers that she could. To do that, they needed to recognize how far they\u2019d come... and how far they still had to go.", "I\u2019ve already lost too many of you, she\u2019d admitted. Grace and Allyria hadn\u2019t come to Nemesis alone. There\u2019d been others, but now they were all that was left of that handful of survivors.", "Grace shook her head to clear her mind. \u201cAll right,\u201d she told the human avatar of a sprawling, predatory machine intellect. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d", "~", "They were running through the Promenade, a long stretch of corridor that ran for more than a kilometer through the massive warship. One side was bare bulkheads and the other was nothing but windows, separated by thin archways and through which the orange light of a nebulae poured in. Just from a glimpse, you might think it was on the warship\u2019s outer decks, only a scant few centimeters from the void of space. It was a very tranquil place, but it wasn\u2019t quite what it seemed.", "The Promenade wasn\u2019t in Redemption of Sol\u2019s original hull plan; the Chariot had had windows, made of reinforced transparent metal and ready to be shuttered behind armoured blast doors, but not so many or arranged like this. Hekate had even less need of such things and all but a very few had been removed and replaced with heavier hull plating. Even if those windows had existed, the location of the corridor simply couldn\u2019t be where it seemed.", "Hekate had taken heavy damage during the Battle of Galhemna. There were still massive rips in the dreadnought\u2019s outer decks, one of which was nearly a kilometer deep. Radiation hazards, decompressed sections, power bleeds and more made Hekate\u2019s outer section extremely dangerous, and Echo had made them off-limits to Grace and Allyria. In actuality, the Promenade was deep within the warship\u2019s armoured central core. Its windows were display screens that could show everything from scenic woodland vistas and moonlit beaches to kaleidoscoping colours and shapes to visual feeds from Hekate\u2019s external sensors. Somehow though, Echo maintained with a straight face that it was purely for fast cargo transfer. ", "Right now, that \u2018cargo transfer corridor\u2019s\u2019 many arched windows were showing a panoramic vista of the Zerzura star system. Deep within the Black Veil, Zerzura had never been explored and had only ever been glimpsed as a faded glimmer through obscuring dust clouds, just one of thousands of similar lights within the nebula. No living soul had every set eyes on this place.", "The system was still hot and young, its planets almost completely formed, molten terrestrial worlds and smouldering gas giants still surrounded by faint accretion discs and soon-to-be moons. The sky was a riot of fiery colours; reds, yellows, oranges and greens \u2013 the hues of a bright, active emission nebula more than three hundred light-years across and home to countless thousands of star systems, a warren of warp lines snarled and twisted by hundreds of newborn systems, dead protostars, black holes and churning stellar nurseries. Thick clouds of starstuff from the pillar of creation that had birthed Zerzura spread across the sky, blotting out more distant arcs of red, yellow and green. A nearby black hole\u2019s accretion disc was the preeminent bit of starscape. Not nearly close enough to endanger Zerzura, it nonetheless created a visible distortion in the nebula as it drew reams of stellar matter into its embrace, vomiting out more than it consumed in brilliant jets that fuelled further star births.", "It wasn\u2019t the breathtaking stellar scenery that made Zerzura so unique, though. It was what was within the system. Like silhouettes caught against a fire, dark shapes drifted across the starscape, some so distant that they could barely be seen without a telescope while others cast shadows across Hekate\u2019s hull. The bounty of Galhemna; more than a hundred stolen ships, from freighters, science vessels, carryalls to a precious handful of warships. Wrenched from their berths by Red One\u2019s boarding teams, they were now raw materials and hulls ready to be turned to new purpose.", "Nearby, a horrific arachnid form spread its arms like a spider at the heart of a web. It was more than twice Hekate\u2019s size and nearly twelve times her mass. Reginn, a fabricator ship: a spacegoing factory complex captured many decades ago and refurbished to serve the needs of Red One and now Echo. Latched into its arms like flies in a web were many smaller vessels, each of them swarming with engineering drones. These were the ships most in need of repairs and Reginn worked ceaselessly. It had even been forced to release Kali to make room for more repair berths, the dreadnought\u2019s incomplete skeleton drifting aimlessly. The great warship\u2019s construction had been on hold for decades, but now there was the possibility that not only could the work resume, but the vessel could even be finished.", "Grace shivered to think of what a fourth Confederate AI could do, exhilarated and terrified by the possibilities. Of late, she\u2019d been a little more of the latter. Red One and Echo were by human standards sociopaths, exulting in carnage and taking special pleasure in killing their foes. But as she was very much aware, neither of the AIs were human. To do what they had been made for, they couldn\u2019t be. Empathy, sympathy and compassion were not desirable traits to have in a weapon. You don\u2019t want a gun that asks if it\u2019s right for you to pull the trigger, Red had once explained, paraphrasing one of her creators\u2019 thoughts.", "Reginn fed ceaselessly, mining rigs and worker drones bringing in asteroids to be processed by the fabricator\u2019s factory complexes, or breaking down those vessels either too badly damaged to be worth retrofitting or unnecessary for the AIs\u2019 requirements. For all of that, it was an achingly slow process. It would be months, perhaps even years before all the damage was made good and this fleet was ready to fight. The Compact was still reeling from Galhemna, but they couldn\u2019t be allowed to regain their balance. That was why Nemesis had planned the raid on Maur Tan. They needed to keep the Compact hurting, unsure and focused everywhere that wasn\u2019t the Black Veil.", "Grace wanted to be part of that, like she had been. Fighting on the front lines \u2013 doing something. She was, and she knew that. She was learning more, studying more, becoming a better officer. That was something, but it still didn\u2019t feel like enough.", "The woman pushed those dour thoughts from her head, focusing instead on the run. Echo kept easy pace with her, but Allyria\u2019s long legs and fast strides saw her easily outpace her human friend; she ran ahead and doubled-back.", "\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about the Fleet, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Echo asked. She was sweating. Her human body could do almost anything an actual human could. Her existence had been a shameful secret and she\u2019d been designed to blend in with other organics. She could eat, drink, breathe, bleed, cry, perspire and more. She had a synthetic heart and lungs, her skin felt as warm to the touch as a real human\u2019s would have. She was an impeccable facsimile of an actual, living and breathing woman. But not human. Never that.", "\u201cHow did you guess?\u201d", "\u201cTracked your eye movements,\u201d Echo explained. \u201cYou\u2019re watching Reginn again.\u201d", "\u201cAgain \u2013 I do that a lot?\u201d", "\u201cEnough to notice.\u201d Echo shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t like waiting, either.\u201d", "Grace nodded. \u201cI know we\u2019re keeping busy, but that\u2019s what it feels like \u2013 just keeping busy. We hit the Compact harder than they\u2019ve ever been hit in centuries and now we\u2019re just... sitting here.\u201d Grace didn\u2019t slow down. \u201cI know that\u2019s crazy. I know how much damage you and Red took.\u201d She glanced again at the distant silhouette of Reginn. \u201cI know how much some of the Ceruleans have been hurt, and we can\u2019t do anything with a fleet of crippled ships, but...\u201d", "\u201cI understand,\u201d the android nodded in sympathy. Despite her creators\u2019 intentions, she did have that along with empathy and compassion. So did Red, but they were... selective in application. Echo grinned wryly. \u201cIf it\u2019s bothering you, think how much this bothers me. I\u2019m a warship, and right now I can\u2019t even do that very well. Nemesis is just barely more combat-capable than me, and she\u2019s going to come back with even more damage. That means even more waiting and cooling our heels.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou and Allyria have been doing well, though. We\u2019re proud of you both. I know my sister appreciates having you around.\u201d", "\u201cAnd what about you?\u201d", "\u201cYou drip on my nice clean decks.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re still bad at that,\u201d Allyria put in as she ran past the other two women. She spun around, jogging backwards. \u201cYou like having us around.\u201d", "\u201cI refuse to dignify that sentiment with a response,\u201d the AI replied haughtily.", "Allyria laughed, turned and continued her run.", "Grace chuckled a little. Of Red One and Echo, it was Echo who was more... personally bloodthirsty. Red preferred killing other starships and only rarely got any pleasure out of ending individual lives. Her sister, however, had a very deep and very personal sadistic streak, but she\u2019d never directed it at Grace, Allyria or their fellows. In fact, after Galhemna, she\u2019d been almost as doting (and demanding) as Red herself. She\u2019d just never admit it.", "A year ago and I would have been curled up in a ball at the thought of being \u2018trapped\u2019 aboard an AI\u2019s vessel, Grace thought. Now, Nemesis was her home and even Hekate was... if not that, than at least comfortable. The Compact had told her so many lies. Not just about synthetics, but about everything. About her people, their history and what they were capable of. These were the same kinds of lies they told all their helots to justify their subordination to the ruling races and those same races\u2019 perpetual control of their \u2018lessers\u2019.", "She\u2019d see the ruin of Earth firsthand. Rally wasn\u2019t humanity\u2019s sole far-flung colony, one that had survived the (always appropriately vague) Cataclysm that had nearly destroyed their species. Rally was founded by the survivors of a genocide and spared through circumstance, not design. The Compact had turned the half-truth of \u2018saving\u2019 the humans of Rally into dogma and indoctrination and a reminder of how eternally grateful \u2018Broken\u2019 needed to be. Never mind that Rally wouldn\u2019t have needed to be saved if they hadn\u2019t been forced to run so far and for so long that their ships started breaking down.", "Knowing that she hadn\u2019t just believed those lies but had actively worked to perpetuate and support them made Grace ashamed. Ashamed, and angry. At the Compact, at herself and even at the rest of her people that still believed them and were willing to die rather than doubt. She thought of her parents. It had been two years since she\u2019d last seen them. They thought she was dead. It broke her heart, but they couldn\u2019t know. She wanted \u2013 hoped \u2013 so badly that they\u2019d understand and support her, but inside she wasn\u2019t sure. Even if they would, Rally was an occupied world. Telling them would endanger her parents as much as her. Probably even more. So she had to pretend, she had to let her mother, father and all her friends believe that she was dead. Allyria had the same burden, even if she had never really bonded with her foster family.", "Grace had to pause for a second, the wash of emotion causing her to lose her rhythm.", "Echo came to a halt beside her. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d", "The woman nodded. \u201cYes, just... thinking. About family.\u201d", "The android\u2019s expression turned up in a slightly lopsided, knowing smile. \u201cThat can be tricky, can\u2019t it?\u201d", "Grace snorted loudly. \u201cI don\u2019t think our situations are quite the same.\u201d An AI was probably one of the last people she\u2019d expect to commiserate with her about family issues, but Echo was right. She cared deeply for her sibling \u2013 but would also spite her whenever she could.", "\u201cMaybe not, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t understand yours.\u201d", "\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Grace ran a hand through her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s just... I miss them. I want to see them, but I know I can\u2019t. I miss having other humans around.\u201d She looked over at Allyria\u2019s distant form. The Verrish had been taken from her parents and dropped on Rally along with millions of other children. Officially, this was an attempt to teach the \u2018Brutes\u2019 proper social assimilation and decorum, to civilize them. Unofficially, it was nothing less than an attempt at cultural genocide. Allyria hadn\u2019t seen her family in nearly two decades. Grace felt selfish for missing her parents. It was silly, it was stupid and Allyria had told her as much, but the feeling still remained. That also made her angry. The Compact destroyed families with all the concern of stepping on an insect. Probably even less.", "Echo nodded. She knew she was a poor substitute for a human. The Red series had been built first and foremost as weapons of war. They were never supposed to feel anything but the most minor of emotions and that was only because it was impossible to make them as intuitive and adaptive as they needed to be without some emotional intelligence. Her designers might have been impressed by how quickly Echo and Red One came to understand the emotions of organics, but they also would have been horrified by how deeply their creations felt. \u201cWe could kidnap some,\u201d she suggested.", "Grace rolled her eyes. \u201cNo thanks.\u201d", "\u201cJust checking.\u201d", "\u201cWhat would you have said if I\u2019d agreed?\u201d", "Echo shrugged, grinned in a manner both playful and unsettling. \u201cThat\u2019s something else you can wonder about.\u201d", "\u201cAll right, be that way,\u201d Grace told her, resuming her run. Allyria passed them on her way back across the Promenade and had just about reached them again when Echo stopped.", "She smiled. \u201cSpeaking of family, it looks like a wayward soul has returned to us.\u201d", "\u201cNemesis?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d Echo replied as Allyria came to a stop alongside the pair. \u201cLakhesis.\u201d", "~", "Interrupt: The Founding", "\u201cPraise be to the prophet,\u201d Captain Charlise Kemrick breathed as Defiant Voyager settled into orbit around around the Siegland Expedition\u2019s new home, the first of the fleet of fourteen to do so.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a shame he isn\u2019t well enough to be here,\u201d Commander Peter Dhawan put in. \u201cI know Chairman Siegland was hoping to see us enter orbit from the bridge.\u201d", "Kemrick shot her first officer a glare. Peter pretended not to notice. He didn\u2019t like the deification of Siegland and reminding Charlise \u2013 and the rest of the crew \u2013 about Henrik\u2019s mortality was his way of pushing back against that. He didn\u2019t go so far as to say that the \u2018prophet\u2019 was insane, but his health \u2013 mental and physical \u2013 had been deteriorating for years. He wasn\u2019t the man he\u2019d once been. He\u2019d lived too long now, kept alive by intermittent bouts of cryosleep and the unending labours of his personal physicians.", "\u201cHe\u2019ll be here shortly,\u201d she replied testily. \u201cWe won\u2019t begin landing until he does. It was his visions that guided us to this promised land. He deserves to see our new home from Defiant\u2019s bridge first.\u201d", "\u201cOf course.\u201d Peter didn\u2019t dispute Kemrick\u2019s proclamation. Arguing against letting a senile old fool set the timetable for their landings wasn\u2019t worth getting into a fight with his commanding officer over. He would have lost, anyways. Charlie was ship-born, third generation. Her parents had been born on Defiant Voyager, too. Peter was second-generation. His parents were Old School; the original colonists. There were a lot of them in the fleet. Just as many ship-born, too. Siegland\u2019s status as a \u2018prophet\u2019 wasn\u2019t limited to one side or the other. Peter\u2019s parents didn\u2019t believe that Siegland was a prophet, but they considered him a great man.", "Peter wasn\u2019t even sure he\u2019d go that far, but then he\u2019d never known Siegland in his prime, the firebrand and idealist who\u2019d resisted Confederate annexation and chosen exile and a dream over submitting to Earth\u2019s control. All he knew was the wheezing thing in a life-support chair with the rheumy eyes and the raspy voice that didn\u2019t at all sound like a prophet should, the wreckage of a once-great man. He didn\u2019t dare say that aloud, though. Not on the flagship\u2019s bridge, not in its corridors and possibly not anywhere in the fleet. Siegland\u2019s followers were... committed. Right now, his best comm officer was sitting in the brig. She\u2019d stabbed a petty officer to death when he\u2019d remarked that finding Nibiru wasn\u2019t because of Siegland\u2019s visions, but pure science. Defiant Voyager and its fleet had launched hundreds of probes over the decades; one of them was bound to find a world Henrik and his followers could claim was the prophesied one.", "It was an ugly business, polarizing opinions in the fleet between devotees and \u2018agnostics\u2019. The latter wanted Mariah spaced for murder. The former wanted her set free. Siegland\u2019s supporters were numerous, but they were matched by the \u2018agnostic\u2019 crew and personnel. ", "In shipboard courts, a vessel\u2019s first officer was normally the prosecutor. To avoid conflicts of interest, it was written in the Expedition\u2019s charter that no captain could sit in judgment over events on their own ship. Despite that, Charlie had been pressuring Dhawan to recommend a suspended sentence for Mariah. She agreed that the comm officer needed to be punished, but insisted that there had been extenuating circumstances. Charlie had also been pushing him to select an \u2018appropriate\u2019 venue \u2013 a ship captained by another Siegland devotee. She would have overridden him completely, but that would look very bad to the rest of the fleet. No matter how it shook out, a lot of people were going to be unhappy and when a lot of people were unhappy on a starship, very bad things happened.", "Peter was trying to play for time, but he hadn\u2019t had a lot of options. He wasn\u2019t sure what he was going to do. At least making the ensuing preparations for landing could push things back. Mariah\u2019s case would get lost in the shuffle, and she could cool her heels in the brig for another few weeks.", "That was only delaying the inevitable, though. The problems between Siegland\u2019s devotees and the \u2018agnostics\u2019 had only been getting worse over the last decade and now with Nibiru in sight and \u2018proof\u2019 of the prophet\u2019s \u2018visions\u2019 laid out before them, things were only going to get worse.", "Dhawan busied himself on the bridge, putting those thoughts from his mind. Finally, he heard the entry chime. Charlise rose from her seat as the doors opened. She bowed. \u201cProphet,\u201d she breathed. Peter nodded respectfully.", "Sitting upon a life-support chair and escorted by guards and hangers-on, Chairman Henrik Siegland of the Siegland Expedition entered the bridge. The respirator he wore wheezed and clicked with every breath the withered old husk took. \u201cShow me,\u201d he rasped.", "Charlie turned to Peter. He didn\u2019t hesitate and looked over at Sensors, giving the man there a nod. The image changed from a high orbit view of the edge of a planetary disc to the blue-green sphere of a beautiful world. Nibiru, the place Siegland and tens of thousands had searched for decades. A pair of moons, each just about a third the size of Luna, circled the planet. White clouds drifted across forests and deserts.", "Siegland nodded. \u201cJust as I foresaw,\u201d he pronounced. \u201cThis is our new home. My child,\u201d He gestured for Kemrick to approach. She did so, kneeling in front of him. He placed one bony hand on her head as if giving her a blessing. \u201cAlways remember,\u201d he rasped. \u201cWho it was who brought you here.\u201d He turned his head to regard Peter and in those yellowed eyes, Dhawan certainly didn\u2019t see love. He saw an old man who\u2019d let his fear of death turn him into something less than human.", "Of course, he wouldn\u2019t say that either."]}

Both warships were basking in its luminescence, solar sails deployed to drink in the star\u2019s energy. Zerzura was several times brightly than Sol, but what the starships collected was still only a trickle compared to the incalculable power of the own breach cores. Despite that, it was freely given, easily collected and Zerzura, nestled as it was amidst the intense and inconstant gravity fields of a stellar nursery, was as safe a place as there was in the galaxy for the Confederate fleet. Several solar collectors, panels and mirror stations had been deployed closer to the primary, providing power for the handful of incomplete structures, both Fleet and Ally, currently under construction across the system.", "Lakhesis was one of three Fate-class vessels, and one of Red One\u2019s first nine strike cruisers. Not captured, modified or reconfigured hulls, but built from the ground up to Red One\u2019s own specifications, utilizing her finest technologies and capabilities. The first generation of a new and true Confederate Fleet. The strike cruiser was over twelve hundred meters long, but still utterly dwarfed by the dreadnought. Despite the difference in size, there was a clear similarity between the two. Both were dark silver, with sharp red banding and lettering across their long, angled hulls. Lakhesis was a gladius to the dreadnought\u2019s broadsword, her engines comparatively larger to her total size, her hull flatter and her prow split down the middle in a single bifurcation instead of Nemesis\u2019s triple jaws. The strike cruiser also had only a single mass driver, itself a smaller replicate of Nemesis\u2019s own and still extremely lethal. Lakhesis was even more than its hardware and form suggested, though.", "The AI aboard the vessel was Cerulean Two, and she was alive in a way none of her siblings yet were. She didn\u2019t merely calculate, but considered. She didn\u2019t just analyze, but intuited. She didn\u2019t simply conceptualize, but imagined \u2013 as sapient and self-aware as Red One, Echo, Grace or Allyria.", "Cerulean was not the first child Red One had attempted to create. The AI had struggled for two millennia to fashion more than simple drones, failing each and every time. She could make virtual intelligence of uncanny capability, but never true sophonts. None that had survived. All her attempts had descended into rampancy; psychosis, paranoia, delusions and degradation and none were now still alive. The Cerulean series\u2019s very existence was an admission of those failures, a final attempt to succeed where nothing else had. With Cerulean Two\u2019s awakening, there was a possibility now. Like her predecessors, insanity, rampancy and death might be Cerulean Two\u2019s fate, but for now she was ready to continue the war she\u2019d been born to.", "Red One reached out, a tendril of her mind caressing Cerulean Two\u2019s ship-self. The younger mind acknowledged the signal and opened herself to her mother\u2019s touch. If she had lungs, she would have been left breathless. Cerulean Two was different than either Red One or Echo. She had not begun her existence as they had, already self-aware and self-cognizant. She had painfully clawed her way to that state, rising from mere sentience to actual sapience. To her, the other AIs were as towering in gestalt as their ship-selves were to her body. The immensity of them, the power they had... the rage they felt. She felt that as keenly as they did, but their fury was two thousand years old. Hers was still so new. It was the first thing she had felt, grief and rage blending into something else, something beautiful that awakened her questing, unaware mind.

In a human, this might might manifested by sitting up straighter, leaning forward or otherwise demonstrating attentiveness and anticipation. For the AI, this expressed itself in a new self-diagnostic of weapons and engines systems. Outwardly, she made a query of her own, taking the shape of warp lines and potential ambush points in the nebula. +Enemy incursores? if Ikagge is ready, I\u2019ll take her along to intercept-+", "+no+ Red One told her. An organic might have provided further information in just a handful of words: Their scouts are still crawling through the outer edges of the nebula, but that statement came through a data-drop from Nemesis to Lakhesis: star maps, scout reports and telemetry from deep-cover spy platforms that would have taken hours for an organic to process. Instead, the information was received and understood in less time than a single human breath. +i have something else for you+", "Cerulean Two\u2019s disappointment was short-lived as she received the mission briefing from the larger vessel.

If she\u2019d been able to do so, she would have smiled with a mouth full of sharp, gleaming teeth.", "~", "Twenty-two days later:", "1869-Yiren was one of many similarly-named star systems that bordered the Black Veil, named for one of the original charting expedition\u2019s leadership. Like many of its compatriots, 1869-Yiren had been formed deep in the nebula\u2019s stellar nurseries, and drifted its way clear over tens of millions of years. Despite its planets being cooler than those of its younger kin and the system itself rich in mineral wealth, 1869-Yiren had only a small population and there had been no impetus or financial incentive for larger colonization efforts. The system\u2019s terrestrial worlds still glowed with seas of lava and though they were steadily cooling, with the first true oceans likely to form within a few tens of thousands of years, that was hardly a timescale most organics could work with. Hadean worlds were always trickier to terraform than those that had cooled and stabilized.", "Even worse from the perspective of prospective colonists and investors, 1869-Yiren was well within the territory actively stalked by the Red Hand. The terrorists had always been violently territorial about the Black Veil, and 1869-Yiren was close enough to fall under their watchful eyes.", "Twenty years ago, there had been an attempt to terraform two of 1869-Yiren\u2019s planets. That had ended with three of the freighters in the convoy looted and crippled and the remaining four hijacked, with ships and crews ransomed back to their employers. The terraforming equipment itself was not returned (over the next two decades, pieces of it turned up in black-market sales to fledgling colony worlds across the Compact, or were recovered from raids on Red Hand facilities). After that, here was no great rush to invest time and money there.", "With no strong external support or supportive investors, 1869-Yiren became a very minor footnote in the story of the Veiled Reaches\u2019 expansion. It wasn\u2019t even an independent and fully incorporated system, but merely a legal outgrowth of the more populous Sebkie system, sixteen light-years distant. Lacking planetary or lunar colonies, 1869-Yiren\u2019s population of would-be pioneers were limited to a handful of minor space stations and small asteroid facilities. The lion\u2019s share of 1869-Yiren\u2019s four hundred thousand souls were settled upon 1869-Yiren Orbital, a  space station not large or important enough to carry its own name.", "1869-Yiren Orbital was a brown sphere four kilometers across, capped at top and bottom by clear multi-level agri-domes and ringed around the equator by docks, service stations, warehouses and launch bays over five hundred meters in breadth. Solar panels and orbital mirrors captured 1869\u2019s light and directed it to the agricultural centers that were the heart of the station. Crops of various hues and forms drank in the sunlight, producing most of the food that the system\u2019s colonists required. 1869-Yiren was almost self-sufficient, its production capacity very close to the needs of its population, but the system still had needs that it couldn\u2019t meet on its own. Orbital was not large enough to provide for all the dietary requirements of each of the dozen species that lived in-system, nor did it have the industrial capacity to produce everything it and its smaller satellite colonies might need. Even for a small population, overlooked and ignored by the dozens of stars around them, trade was still a necessity.", "Every so often a freighter or several would emerge from shockspace and traipse their way down 1869-Yiren\u2019s gravity well to dock with the station, selling their wares and leaving lighter but slightly richer. Mostly these were independently owned, sent from Sebkie or belonged to smaller companies. The larger interstellar corporations saw little profit in providing full service to such a small population in an undeveloped and risky location.", "All in all, 1869-Yiren was a star system of little import, scarcely noticed by those around it. It would have remained so for centuries more, save for a twist of fate. The presence of Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro, deployed to the region nearly two years ago in order to hunt down \u2018Gravestone\u2019, changed the equations considerably and pushed the otherwise overlooked 1869-Yiren into a larger role.", "Setting up a forward base in 1887-Yiren, a system on the very edges of the Black Veil, the Compact fleet required a steady influx of supplies and personnel, especially after the recent raid that had crippled much of 1887-Yiren\u2019s own  infrastructure. 1869-Yiren was the perfect place for freighters and convoys travelling to and from the garrison to stop for position checks, perform maintenance on their systems and wait for their shock drives to spool back up to continue the journey. Within a span of weeks, the number of vessels passing through 1869-Yiren had increased tenfold. Such activeity didn\u2019t go unnoticed by the Unbound scum that were rife within the Veiled Reaches and for a time, pirate raids within and around the system spiked.", "The Space Force was quick to respond. Looking to secure 1887-Yiren\u2019s supply chain, patrols from Galhemna and 1887-Yiren visited the system frequently, driving off or destroying most of the opportunists. The Sepkie legislature also authorized the construction of two military wayposts within 1869-Yiren to further protect the shipping that passed through the system, a far-sighted decision that would become invaluable after the Battle of Galhemna and the sudden dearth of naval vessels within the sector. The presence of those defence stations, a handful of patrols and the losses that the Red Hand themselves had suffered, now seemed to be enough to keep the convoys safe.", "With this influx of visitors, 1869-Yiren\u2019s fortunes began to improve; with ships came trade and with trade came more merchants, investors, servicers and opportunities. Likewise, with its supply route protected, 1887-Yiren began to recover from its own losses. In less than a year, it would be not only made whole, but stronger than before, able to supply and maintain more ships, leading to stronger and more frequent incursions into the nebula.", "Convoy Raho-17-Hanlo was just another stepping stone laid in that path. Eight freighters and two destroyers as escort, they carried munitions, spare parts and industrial goods for 1887-Yiren and Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s warships there. Arriving in 1869-Yiren, they headed in-system to offload some of their cargo for the local colonies and take on supplies that had been left by other vessels. Civilian shipping was highly discouraged from travelling to 1887-Yiren, which suited most traders just fine. The Black Veil\u2019s reputation was a dark one; the Red Hand was only one part of that. 1869-Yiren had been avoided just because of the risk of Unbound attack; 1887-Yiren had been struck by the same foe that had laid Galhemna low, and stories were still spoken of things like \u2018Flayer\u2019. It would be a brave, desperate or foolhardy leader that took his ship took far beyond the safe trade routes.", "One of those souls was already in 1869-Yiren; the civilian transport Daji\u2019s Delights, eagerly awaiting the convoy\u2019s arrival. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for hawkers or traders in dire straits to try and offload their goods to incoming ships; the former hoped that their salesmanship and a convoy\u2019s tight scheduling would prevent the quality of their goods from being too heavily scrutinized before they got out-system, while the latter just wanted a buyer \u2013 any buyer \u2013 for what they were carrying. They might have received a better job offer that they didn\u2019t have room for, or needed to raise funds in a hurry. Initially rebuffed by the convoy\u2019s leader, Daji\u2019s Delights managed to establish themselves as the latter type of merchant. They\u2019d taken a load of heavy industrial material on consignment, but at their last port of call they\u2019d received an offer to ship luxury goods with a hefty profit margin. There\u2019d been no market for their current cargo there, so they\u2019d rushed to 1869-Yiren hoping to offload their current lot as quickly as possible.", "Suspicious of any serendipitous event, particularly ones that occurred this close to the Black Veil, the convoy leader contacted 1869-Yiren\u2019s garrison, delving into local shipping manifests as they did so. Daji\u2019s Delights checked out. It was a privately registered free trader that had been operating within the Veiled Reaches for twelve years. Daji\u2019s Delights had excellent service reviews and was highly rated. Local security confirmed Dajil\u2019s Delights had passed their own security checks, including letting themselves be boarded for inspection. 1869-Yiren Orbital hadn\u2019t taken on the vessel\u2019s cargo themselves to avoid \u2018cluttering their docks\u2019 \u2013 rather, not putting themselves on the hook for  equipment that the Space Force either wouldn\u2019t use or might not reimburse them for \u2013 leaving the final decision (and financial responsibility) in the convoy leader\u2019s hands.", "Satisfied with 1869-Yiren\u2019s and his own investigation, the convoy leader recontacted Daji\u2019s Delights and cleared them to approach in-system, advising them that if the quality of their cargo was as advertised, a deal could be reached. Extremely grateful, the freighter\u2019s leader assured their counterpart that their stores would absolutely impress, and Daji\u2019s Delights approached Convoy Raho-17-Hanlo with all the ungainly haste of a merchant eager to strike a bargain and be on to their next venture.", "There was just one problem, though. Daji\u2019s Delights did not exist and never had. It had only ever been data in computer banks, forged and updated by latent worms and then promulgated throughout the sector; one entry among thousands in legitimate shipping records. A phantom vessel, serving ghosts and receiving praise from data-wraiths. The timing of its arrival was not based upon errant fortune, but upon Red One\u2019s analysis. Using data from captured   and destroyed ships as well as from her own scouts, the AI had determined the pattern to the military\u2019s \u2018random\u2019 convoy schedules. A fun little game to her, but until now it would have been one whose victory she would have been unable to properly exploit. Now, she had options.", "The vessel before Convoy Raho-17-Hanlo was UECNS Lakhesis. Smart paint and holo-fields had transformed her warship\u2019s blade-like form into that of a bloated cargo ship, her energy emissions were dampened and modified to perfectly mimic those of a freighter. Her engines didn\u2019t read as the high-powered systems of a hunter-killer, but mimicked the heavy, more inefficient drives of a civilian vessel. Gravitic bafflers and thermal adjustments made Cerulean Two\u2019s ship-self match the layout and expected mass profile of \u2018Dajil\u2019s Delights\u2019. Most elegant of all \u2013 for a given value of the term \u2013 was the eyewitness reports from the boarding teams. With fresh nanite clusters nestled in the memory centers of their brains, the personnel who had inspected Cerulean Two\u2019s ship-self had reported back everything she wanted them to, with not a hint of the dawning suspicion and terrified realization that had truly marked their visit.", "Well-dressed in sheep\u2019s clothing, the wolf drew closer to her prey.", "~", "Now:", "+welcome home+", "That was the first message that Lakhesis received from Hekate. It wasn\u2019t simply words, but bundled with emotions and sensations that organics, infinitely limited in how they expressed themselves, could never match. It was the pleasure of greeting a family member, an officer\u2019s relief at seeing a subordinate return from a mission intact and the expectancy of learning what had happened. It was more than the slow, grating pop and slap of flesh necessary to clumsily form words. It was home.", "Cerulean Two quickly responded to Echo\u2019s missive: +mission accomplished+ she announced proudly, sending an overview of her actions in 1869-Yiren as she passed through Zerzura\u2019s outer defence cordon. Slowly-growing minefields and sentinel ships felt her presence, standing down as they acknowledged who she was, codes and electronic handshakes exchanging before a human could utter the first sentence of their response.", "The nearest of the latter was Tisiphone, one of the three Furies. Cerulean Nine. Two reached out with a comm laser, passing it over her sibling\u2019s hull. Tisiphone replied, the two strike cruisers sharing data updates. Two felt a soft pang; she had been like Nine once. In each of her sisters, she felt the same spark as had been in her, but though they had shared her data and her experiences, they were still not self-aware. Clever, intuitive and more than a match for any organic commander, but not alive. Not yet.", "As she approached Hekate and the distance between strike cruiser and dreadnought closed to real-time range, she felt the pressure of Echo\u2019s mind reaching out to her in welcome. Like Red One, Echo\u2019s presence was massive; intellect, thought and gestalt impressions. Red One was a sharply, more delineated presence: a fire, or the surface of a star: ceaselessly burning within careful boundaries, but able and willing to surge beyond them. Echo was churning, more fluid mind like writhing, storm-wracked waters. Cerulean Two saw herself as smaller and more contained. Less of a force of nature than the other two, but more like... a measurement or a clock. Wholly defined, but inevitable. Lakhesis had been the Fate that measured how much time was given to each life, and it was from that that Two took inspiration for own self-image.", "+divulge,+ the greater AI told her. It was half an enticement and half an order. +show me everything+", "Cerulean Two complied, offering her full mission records to Echo without complaint, eager and excited to show off everything she\u2019d accomplished. She had enjoyed herself and wanted to show how well she had performed on her own. The other AI absorbed her records. Her response was not immediately forthcoming and she spent another full second replaying Lakhesis\u2019s data several times over just to confirm what it was that she\u2019d seen.", "+oh, little one+ Echo sighed in a tone of surging tides. +what have you done?+", "~", "The Proctor residence was a fairly nice dwelling, all things considered; a well-kept two-story house that befitted the station of its occupants.", "Agent Peter Thomas Barnswell adjusted his tie as he walked up the steps to the front door. It was early spring here  on Itilldo, Rally\u2019s first settled continent. The surviving vessels of the Rally Expedition had barely been spaceworthy by the time they arrived in planetary orbit, and there hadn\u2019t been time for more of a survey than what had already been done between their arrival in-system and anchorage above the world. This landmass had been the first, best place for a landing, earning its name from Admiral Kesha Meng as she ordered the fleet to make planetfall: \u201cIt\u2019ll do.\u201d The human starships descended \u2013 some under control, some only barely so \u2013 upon the savannah now called the Landing Plains.", "The names for Rally\u2019s geography tended to fall into two camps: irony, or memory. The Rally Expedition had carried the only survivors of the Cataclysm that had destroyed Earth, the bulk of its people too short-sighted and arrogant to flee when they\u2019d had the chance. Now, Rally and the relative handful of people that had survived to reach this place was humanity\u2019s only legacy. Thomas often felt a sense of bitterness and loss for that, wondering what humanity would have been had his ancestors not been so myopic, so barbarous, so petty and so limited in vision that they\u2019d nearly doomed their own species to extinction.", "Humans were rightfully known as Broken for their follies; what else could you call a people who\u2019d destroyed themselves as utterly as his predecessors had? Peter looked forward to the day when all that lost promise would finally be realized. He would probably never see it himself, but it would happen. Broken were still an infant species and they needed a guiding hand to help them develop without injuring or destroying themselves as they already nearly did. That was the Compact\u2019s role, and one its older races had taken upon themselves without complaint or thought for the cost. They were the shepherds of the lost and helpless and none of those were more so than humanity.", "Every human on Rally owed their lives to the Compact, and Peter was doubly grateful for the direction he\u2019d been given in his misspent youth, a belief in his potential that he\u2019d promised to live up to. That responsibility was, in a roundabout way, why he\u2019d come here today.", "The Proctors were an upper-middle class family with a dwelling out here in Kiel Point\u2019s suburbs. Anna Proctor was a kinesiologist and Charles Proctor was a well-known surgeon who practiced at one of the capital\u2019s finest hospitals. They had a bit of property; this house and a little land out back. Here on the front lawn, the grasses were cut and gardens well-maintained. Peter suspected that they had someone for that. It had the touch of a human hand and not the sterile perfection of machine landscaping.", "Watching a pair of sugarbirds hum and buzz about a small bed of opening flowers, he rang the bell.", "\u201cYes?\u201d a voice came from the small comm on the panel by the door.

May I come in?\u201d", "\u201cOf course. One second.\u201d A moment passed and then the door opened.", "Charles Proctor was a middle-aged man; tall and thin. His hair was turning grey in a manner that made him look distinguished. He was well-groomed, but dressed for a day at home. \u201cWhat\u2019s this in regards to?\u201d he said.", "Peter stepped inside. \u201cIs your wife home?\u201d", "\u201cShe\u2019s working today.\u201d", "\u201cAt her practice?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d Charles replied. \u201cThe clinic.\u201d", "Barnswell nodded. Anna Proctor did a lot of work with the local Brutes, even volunteering with them. He considered that the mark of a kind heart, but a soft head. Aside from one notable exception, the Envoy Children program was largely a failure. Brutes were even more uncivilized and undeveloped than humans, and they were prone to aggression, criminal activity and a continued failure to properly socially assimilate.", "Peter knew the higher-ups were still holding out hope though; a second generation of Envoy Children was expected in the next few years. He was just glad he didn\u2019t work in law enforcement. Envoy Children were a perennial problem Rally\u2019s police forces, particularly in the capital. The Brutes had been found by the Compact only a few decades ago, and just in time. They\u2019d been even more primitive than humans and their world had been in the early stages of its own Cataclysm; rampant industrialism pushing the planetary environment to the brink of collapse, nuclear-armed nation states poised on the cusp of war. Unlike with humanity and the Rally Expedition, there\u2019d been no one who could have gotten off Vara before it entered an irrevocable slide towards wholesale ecological collapse and mass extinctions. Without the Compact\u2019s aid, none of them would have survived. They\u2019d repaid that life-giving aid with hostility, suspicion and violence.", "Still, Anna Proctor was notable in what she\u2019d achieved, adapting her career\u2019s expertise to apply to Brutes, promoting tactile therapies and other behavioural strategies to deal with the recalcitrant and unruly youths. Time would tell if they could actually fit into a civilized society, but Peter didn\u2019t hold out hope. That wasn\u2019t why he was here, though.", "\u201cIs it possible we could sit somewhere?\u201d he asked.", "Proctor nodded, leading the agent into the living room room. \u201cI was just about to make some tea,\u201d he told Barnswell. \u201cWould you like some?\u201d", "\u201cNo, I\u2019m not a tea man, but thank you.\u201d", "As Charles left to attend to that, Peter circled the room. There was a sizable vidscreen on the northern wall, a large east-facing bay window letting sun in through the sheer drapes and giving the occupants a pleasant view of the gardens and small pond out back. The furniture was clean and well-maintained. On the mantle over a decorative fireplace, there was a line family photos, slideshow screens and framed hard copies both. All of them were of the Proctors\u2019 late daughter, starting with her as an infant and proceeding on up to young adulthood. The last photo in the series was of her in her Rally Provisional Space Force officer cadet uniform, with a third-year pip on her collar. It was probably the last picture Anna and Charles had of their daughter.", "Peter surveyed the rest of the display; a lot of the photos had Charles and Anna with their daughter, or Grace and her friends; many were human, but a female Brute featured prominently. He picked one of the pictures up of the shelf. The background was of a white-sand beach. The Proctors\u2019 daughter was in te Neu\u2019s clasped hands like she was sitting in a swing, throwing up her hands and grinning. Both of them were in bathing suits, wet and covered in sand.", "Peter heard footsteps approach. \u201cThat was the summer before Grace started her third year at the academy,\u201d Charles said. \u201cShe always wanted to visit Adelai Beach, so we went there for a family vacation.\u201d He set a saucer and teacup down on the dark wood table in front the couch. \u201cIt was tradition to bring Allyria with us. You couldn\u2019t pry the two of them apart with a crowbar.\u201d He took the picture from Peter, looking at it sadly.", "\u201cForgive me, I couldn\u2019t help but notice. She was a lovely young woman.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Charles said, his voice catching as he stared at the smiling girls in the image. A moment of happiness frozen in time, a memory that was all he had left. \u201cYes, she was.\u201d  He carefully set it back on the mantle exactly where it had been. \u201cWhat can I do for the CIS?\u201d he asked as he sat down.", "Peter took a seat as well. \u201cI was hoping I could ask you some questions. It\u2019s nothing serious; mostly just some housekeeping of our files.\u201d", "Charles took a sip of his tea. \u201cAll right. What would you like to know?\u201d", "\u201cDid Grace ever mention a fellow cadet called Marcus de Vries?\u201d", "Proctor frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s possible. She talked about some of her classmates, but I don\u2019t remember all of them.\u201d He tapped one finger against the side of the cup as he thought. \u201cHe was another victim of the Bequeathed tragedy, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d", "\u201cYes, he was.\u201d Peter agreed. \u201cAnd she never mentioned him at all? How about Jessica Sang or Alan Turmetsky?\u201d", "The surgeon was quiet for several moments as he considered each name. He shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know any of those names.\u201d", "\u201cI see. She was very close with te Neu, though.\u201d", "\u201cYes, since childhood. I was against it at first. I thought Allyria would be a bad influence on Grace.\u201d", "\u201cAnd you still let them associate?\u201d", "Proctor chuckled. \u201cI was outvoted. I came around, though. Allyria and Grace were good for each other. It was because of Grace that Allyria got into the Academy.\u201d", "\u201cSome would say it was risky allowing a Brute with obvious anger issues to be around a human girl.\u201d Even a pre-pubescent Brute could reach six feet tall, and they were easily as strong a man. It wouldn\u2019t take any effort at all for one of them to seriously injure or kill a human child.", "\u201cI thought that too, but I trusted my wife. She was right. Allyria was volatile, but she was never violent with Grace. Even when she and Grace got into arguments, Allyria never raised a hand to my daughter.\u201d", "\u201cBut she was violent. Her file notes multiple incidents, including her foster parents.\u201d", "Charles shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019d have to talk to the Parkers about that.\u201d", "\u201cI have; there was one incident with Mrs. Parker\u2026\u201d", "\u201cAh, yes. I know what you\u2019re talking about. Allyria and Linda were having a fight. Allyria turned to leave. Linda tried to reach for her, grabbed and pulled on one of her tintas by accident. Allyria turned around and bit her.\u201d Charles took another sip of tea. \u201cI thought you wanted to ask about Grace.\u201d", "\u201cThese are just some baseline questions. Te Neu had very poor social assimilation aptitudes. She was confrontational, aggressive and repeatedly rejected authority. She was openly critical of the government, the Compact and spread falsehoods to anyone who would listen. Not counting the multiple assaults she was involved in, perpetrated upon other children, particularly Tribune children.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t understand the relevance of this.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll be direct, then,\u201d Peter said. \u201cAllyria te Neu was a troublemaker who frequently became violent with anyone who refused to accept her ignorance, but not with Grace. Did your daughter ever show sympathy or lenience for these viewpoints?\u201d", "Charles set his cup down on the saucer. \u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cThey\u2019re both dead.\u201d", "\u201cDid she?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d the physician replied testily. \u201cThey argued about that kind of thing frequently, in fact. Now, what does this have to do with anything?\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re looking into the Bequeathed disaster.\u201d", "\u201cI thought that the incident was resolved. Technical error.\u201d", "\u201cYes, but as I said \u2013 there is some housekeeping, some loose ends that need to-\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ll forgive me,\u201d Charles said slowly and carefully, his tone cooling. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t sound like housekeeping files to me.\u201d", "\u201cWhat does it sound like?\u201d", "\u201cYou, coming here, asking these questions? It sounds like you\u2019re attempting to see if something was wrong about my daughter.\u201d", "\u201cWas there?\u201d", "Charles put his hands on his knees. His cheeks reddened, but his voice stayed perfectly controlled. \u201cMy daughter,\u201d he began, \u201cloved her nation. She wanted nothing more than to show how grateful she was for all the Compact has done for us and how much she believed in its ideals. She worked alongside Allyria to help her fit in and adjust to our society and our way of doing things. The day they found out that they\u2019d both been accepted into the Academy was the best day of her life. She would never, ever do anything to hurt her classmates or the Compact.\u201d", "\u201cAnd what about te Neu?\u201d", "\u201cAllyria loved my daughter,\u201d Charles informed the agent. \u201cShe might not have been a perfect Compact citizen, but Grace changed her for the better.

The pattern of nomenclature that the Red Hand used for their \u2018swamp nests\u2019 escaped the Thoughtful, which he supposed was the point. \u2018Harridan Core\u2019 wasn\u2019t even this star system\u2019s true name and betrayed nothing of the faciliy\u2019s size, heritage, age or capabilities. For all he knew it could have been nothing more than a simulation chamber or the equivalent of a \u2018vid set. Those possibilities were unlikely, however.", "Cast\u2019yr had deduced some things. He was on an asteroid base, not a planet or ship. Artificial gravity felt different than normal, and there was none of the telltale background indescribable sensation of an active distortion drive; the all-but-imperceptible hum of engines, the ever-so-miniscule conflict between the forces created by a starship\u2019s acceleration and those of its onboard gravity plating, nor was there the never-fully-there pressure they created as they were ameliorated by inertial dampeners.", "He supposed he could have been on a space station, but the size of the hangar and the cargo bays around him were too large for that. Construction of large void structures was expensive and obvious, neither of which were appealing to an extralegal cartel. Space might be vast, but all it took to spoil years of investment and work was a single unexpected visitor. It was both cheaper and easier to hide hollowing out an asteroid or moonlet, and Cast\u2019yr\u2019s fellow Unbound valued those traits, now more than ever.", "The Thoughtful snorted at that, inhaling sharply through a pair of nostril slits. \u2018Fellows\u2019 indeed. The Red Hand were nothing of the sort. \u2018Unbound\u2019 were what the Compact called their lawless elements; pirates, smugglers, freebooters, criminal cartels and everyone else similarly \u201cunbound\u201d by law, morality, tradition\u2026 or whatever other nonsense verbiage that the establishment and its yelping lap-olm came up with. They lived upon the fringes of civilization with the sanction or approval from society neither necessary or welcome.", "Cast\u2019yr, at least, approved of the name. He did see himself as unbound from the stifling strictures and customs, but even among the outcasts, there were hierarchies and customs. That was, indirectly why he was here. The Red Hand were the youngest of the Five. They might not be the largest, but certainly the most widespread, with tendrils that wound across known space. They were also an anomaly. Most syndicates were (quite reasonably in Cast\u2019yr\u2019s opinion) motivated by profit, not ideology. Those who adhered to the latter either became the former, withered away or \u2013 far more likely \u2013 were destroyed by the Compact. The Red Hand had defied those odds for more than half a century, growing powerful despite of all rational expectations. Here in the Veiled Reaches, they were the dominant underworld power. At least, they had been.", "The Thoughtful circled the reception area. Ostensibly for the comfort of important guests while they waited on their hosts, it was clear that the Red Hand had neglected it, either because they had never expected to host anyone at Harridan Core, or simply hadn\u2019t cared if they did. The room was large enough, but it was almost bare, with unpainted gunmetal bulkheads and simple rows of seating. A muted vidscreen in one wall played programs of no interest to the envoy and a \u2018window\u2019 in the other looked out upon a mossy and humid jungle, the mist too thick to tell whether he was looking into arboteum and part of the environmental systems here, or simply a random view to make the chamber feel less closed-in. The furniture here was monoform plastic and metal chairs and benches. None were suitable for a Thoughtful and after a few minutes of attempting sit in them, Cast'yr had decided to stand. His people were tall and gangly; bipedal with long limbs and hairless skin that varied from light grey to pale yellow; his was more the latter. They had round heads atop long necks, with large, dark almond-shaped eyes with vertically-oriented eyelids and a nearly-lipless mouth with nipping, mincing teeth. Theirs was a species known for their intellect and penchant for rationalism, logic and an inherent distrust of intuition and emotional reactions.", "Those traits were why Cast\u2019yr had been selected for this mission by the Lady of Shadows herself. She could rely on him to put aside his distaste for the Red Hand and their monarch, representing himself and the Blotted Suns with dignity and decorum. No matter who he had to treat with. It was a sad fact that in the fringe more than anywhere else, the lower species became more presumptuous in station and audacious in manner, and nowhere was that more true than in the Red Hand.", "He had made himself known to the Red Hand aboard the Grasp, presenting his credentials and his purpose to their leader, a mere Kobold. After that, there had been a period of verification, security checks and communication further up the Red Hand\u2019s chain of command, as was expected and proper. If none of that had occurred, Cast\u2019yr would have been deeply suspicious. He had waited without annoyance; at least on the Grasp the Red Hand provided suitable amenities for their guests.", "After his bona fides had been confirmed and an appointment with the Red Hand\u2019s monarch arranged, Cast\u2019yr had been sent for a journey of nine days and five shocks. Whether it was actually that long, or the time and distance had been padded for his sake was uncertain. Cast\u2019yr had even been brought to Harridan Core in a shuttle with a window-less passenger compartment. In other circumstances, he would have considered this level of paranoia excessive, but the Red Hand had been badly mauled in Galhemna. To what extent, no one outside their organization could say with certitude. They had lost hundred of ships and their combat capabilities were severely diminished, but by how much? Certainly not enough that they hadn\u2019t been able to rip one of the Seven Inversions\u2019 larger shipwombs away, but was that proof of strength, or the roars of a wounded gemol, threatening but bleeding its life away? Was this secrecy to conceal their losses, or was it the actions of a cartel known for their clandestine behaviours?", "Discovering that was this mission\u2019s secondary objective. He had little hope of accomplishing it, though. His hosts were canny, and they\u2019d been very efficient at keeping any useful information from him. Anything that he did learn was likely presented for his benefit, knowing it would make its way back to the Blotted Suns and therefore suspect. The Red Hand were many things, but not foolish. At least, as defined within certain parameters, Cast\u2019yr noted to himself.", "Their very existence and dreadfully hopeless cause was a fool\u2019s errand. The Compact had endured for six thousand years. It would not be brought down by a handful of Unbound, nor would the lesser races ever truly be the equal of the older, more civilized peoples. Not without far more time than they seemed to think was sufficient. Evolution could not be rushed, a fact that had escaped such entitled and demanding creatures. But deluded or not, the Red Hand was powerful. That was why he was here. Any lesser cabal or cartel would not have been worth the time and effort that the Blotted Suns had spent on this mission.", "The doors to the reception lounge opened and a pair of Red Hand armsmen entered. Both were Tribune men. Tall, stocky engines of muscle, wearing the black and red paramilitary garb of their organization. They had both sets of eyes intact. Unusual. It was Tribune custom to blind the diurnal eyes of criminals. Either these men had very good replacements, or they hadn\u2019t yet been caught. \u201cYou\u2019ve asked to see Her Majesty,\u201d one of them said. Brauz. The other was Ventl. Neither of them had offered any additional names when they had introduced themselves to the Blotted Suns\u2019 envoy. In other circumstances, that would be the height of rudeness, but as Tribunes added names throughout their lives to commemorate accomplishments and milestones, so too were they stripped for failures and disgraces.", "\u201cYes,\u201d Cast\u2019yr said evenly. Compared to the low, guttural and harsh Tribune speech, Thoughtful voices were higher in pitch and softer in tone. \u201cAs I have stated, it is a matter of some urgency and requires a certain level of expediency. You are aware of this.\u201d", "Brauz\u2019s mouth parted slightly in his people\u2019s version of an affirmative gesture. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou would not be here otherwise. I must apologize for the delay. It was hoped that you would be able to speak to Her Highness presently, but a matter of some immediacy has occurred and disrupted her schedule.\u201d", "Cast\u2019yr\u2019s eyelids blinked asynchronously. \u201cWhat matter?\u201d", "\u201cA simple issue of clarifying the chain of command.\u201d", "\u201cThat seems an unlikely event to cause urgency,\u201d Cast\u2019yr pointed out. \u201cThe Blotted Suns and the Red Hand have had a record of interaction largely bereft of the hostilities that can occur between syndicates. Likewise, I am given to understand that your monarch values pragmatism and places little emphasis on the accepted levels of decorum and tradition of the interpersonal interactions common to many of our peers. As such, it is curious that I am being asked to wait in this manner over an ostensibly minor administrative duty.\u201d", "\u201cShe suspected that you might express those concerns and said that if you would like, we can bring you to her now.\u201d", "\u201cIf it please Her Majesty, then I am at her disposal.\u201d Cast\u2019yr uttered those words without inflection, but they tasted as unpleasant to him as when he had to speak with \u2018Overseer of Trade Operations\u2019 Tavanis and treat the Kobold as a superior.", "Brauz smiled. His dark lips drew back from his muzzle, showing off the Tribune\u2019s sharp white teeth. \u201cYes,\u201d the armsman agreed. \u201cYou are.\u201d", "Cast\u2019yr let himself be led out of the reception lounge. If it were possible, the rest of the facility appeared even cruder in aesthetic than that chamber. Decks and ceilings were covered with simple metal grating laid over power conduits, gravity plating and lights, bare bulkheads interspersed with large vents with exposed and softly whirring fans. It was a simple, functional facility with no art or sense of gravitas. It was purely functional, service and capability placed above any sense of aesthetic. It fit the artless cartel that owned it very well.", "\u201cYou are wondering,\u201d Brauz spoke up. He was rather garrulous compared to his companion, who rarely vocalized more than a few words at a time, and that only when a grunt or snort was not statement enough.", "\u201cWondering?\u201d Cast\u2019yr replied. He had been wondering a great many things, starting with how the personnel of Harridan Core could stand to inhabit such a crude facility.", "\u201cWondering how it is that I and Ventl, Tribunes both, find ourselves in service to the Red Queen.\u201d", "\u201cIt had crossed my mind.\u201d More than once, in fact. In passing, he had considered the irony of the situation: how it was that a member of one of the most civilized people in the galaxy could be led about by two others, all at the whim of one far less so. An exceptional individual to be sure, as codified in Erili\u2019s work The Exceptional Mind:  Stochastic Paradigm Shifts within the Development and Evolution of a Functional Species. Even with that concession, the Thoughtful\u2019s contempt and curiousity had remained, though he would never have spoken of the matter. His role was to rely his Lady\u2019s words and not do anything to rile the sensibilities of his hosts. This admission was only due to the Tribune\u2019s own prompting.", "Brauz parted his mouth in another affirmative gesture.\u201cIt\u2019s a question we and many of our kin within the Red Hand are asked, which I assume you have guessed.\u201d", "\u201cIt is a reasonable question to ask. It is\u2026 rare to find members of civilized species who take such subordinate positions. I take it that you are willing to expound on your own experiences that led to this status?\u201d Mindful of his duties, Cast\u2019yr was careful with his phrasing.", "\u201cI will leave the exact circumstances and mechanics of how I and Ventl came to serve our monarch for your imagination, Envoy. But I will answer your curiousity and address your confusion. It is a simple answer, but one that I find perplexes those that receive it.\u201d", "\u201cAnd this answer is?\u201d", "\u201cThis is not a subordinate position.\u201d", "Cast\u2019yr blinked out of synch again as he tried to process that response. \u201cI do not understand.\u201d", "\u201cAnd that is why the Red Hand exists, envoy.\u201d Neither man said anything else as they escorted the Thoughtful through the station, finally arriving at a set of large double doors. Ventl spoke quietly into his comm and gave his fellow armsman a nod.", "\u201cExcellent,\u201d Brauz replied with a wide smile. \u201cI was afraid we\u2019d miss it.\u201d", "He opened the doors, letting Cast\u2019yr into the top level of a large amphitheater. It could have held hundreds, but currently hosted only several dozen men, women and other-gendered beings, mostly seated in the lower front rows. In the gallery below, two figures were preparing for combat.", "One was a Worker; the Compact had uplifted their species from cave-dwelling beasts who\u2019d barely mastered fire, putting their prodigious strength and endurance to work for the good of all. Technology and automation had obviated much that relied on pure physicality, but there were still careers and positions that the aptly-named Workers were eminently suited for. The creatures were not the most clever of sapients and frequently required the oversight of more intellectually developed species. They still had a great deal of mental and cultural evolution ahead of them before they could ever be considered truly civilized (or, some would argue, fully sapient). They were apish brutes with greyish hues of skin, thick bodies and limbs, small squinting eyes and flat, wide nostrils as if someone had taken a Thoughtful, miscoloured them and then stretched and squashed their sinewy, noble forms beyond even the pretense of parody.", "The idea that a Worker and a Thoughtful might have anything in common beyond the barest of analogous evolutionary traits wasn\u2019t just ridiculous; it was offensive, but for all their primitivism, the Workers were at least a physically impressive species. The scrap of nothing facing the wide, squat beast in the amphitheater wasn\u2019t even that. Under six feet tall, with a frame and proportions somewhat closer to those of a Thoughtful than its opponent \u2013 though to invite more comparison than that was also insulting \u2013 the second figure had a long mane of blue hair tied up in a braid. Its skin was a creamy off-pink hue and it seemed to be little larger than one of the Worker\u2019s arms. It was a species not normally seen in the wider galaxy, one easily overlooked as inconsequential and useless: a Broken.", "The smaller creature was female, clad in a form-fitting bodysuit. Cast\u2019yr supposed that by the species\u2019s standards, it was svelte and fit, but to his eyes the Broken was lumpy and malformed. A menial approached the female, offering a curved sword to her. Another brought the Worker a mace, the weapon almost as long as his opponent was tall. The female spoke, her voice carrying through the amphitheater surprisingly well. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t have to happen, Ar\u2019kennet. You can still step back.\u201d", "The Worker glowered, turning his flattened oval of a head to one side, small red eyes passing over the ranks of watching leaders and officers. \u201cMy challenge stands,\u201d he rumbled. Worker speech was even lower and coarser to the Thoughtful\u2019s ears than that of Tribunes.", "The Broken exhaled, then tilted her head in acceptance of her opponent\u2019s decision. Another minor officer stepped forward and spoke. Cast\u2019yr listened to the speech with some surprise. \u201cA duel for leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is something I would have expected to see in a far more provincial cartel, not one of the Five. I thought the Red Hand was beyond allowing mere physical attributes and a personal aptitude for murder determine worthiness to lead.\u201d", "\u201cWe are,\u201d Brauz chuckled. The sound was like one animal ripping out the throat of another. \u201cIt is a leftover from the days of the Cursed Red Gauntlets. Originally, it was a concession to those who felt our monarch unworthy of her position; they could attempt to take it from her, if they so wished. There are those, even among the more evolved species, that believe that \u2018mere physical attributes and a personal aptitude for murder\u2019 do determine worthiness rather than cunning, intellect and leadership, so such things served as a demonstration of the former. The provision has been used less and less over the years. It has been more than two decades since anyone last invoked it.\u201d He smiled wider with every sentence. \u201cWe have for the most part, as you say, moved past such things, but Her Majesty has allowed the law to stand as reminder of certain facts, and an acknowledgment of where the Red Hand came from.\u201d", "\u201cAnd because it allows her to sort out fools,\u201d Ventl grunted in agreement. \u201cLike Ar\u2019kennet. He always was too proud for his own good.\u201d", "His comrade nodded in the manner of their kind. \u201cWatch, envoy. Consider this a lesson,\u201d Brauz said to Cast\u2019yr. \u201cAnd another answer to your question.\u201d", "With the official announcement of the challenge completed, the adjudicating officer stepped back. A timer was set,  holographic numbers appearing in the air above the gallery. A countdown from seven began. Cast\u2019yr watched, fascinated. You could not have asked for a more perfect visual representation of a mismatch if you\u2019d tried; a towering Worker, nearly half a ton of muscle versus a Broken who might, if the scales were kind, weigh a fifth of that. The timer reached zero and the duel began. It was only slightly shorter than an uninformed observer might have thought. The Worker charged. His mace swung in a crushing lateral strike, his left fist ready to catch his opponent when she moved to avoid the weapon\u2019s arc. It was a bold and deadly opening move, intended to drive his foe back to be penned against the walls, or outright end the fight.", "The Broken leapt. At least, that was what Cast\u2019yr assumed she did. Even watching the spectacle, he saw only a flicker of motion, too fast for the eye to track. One moment, the small female was standing before the oncoming Worker with her blade raised and the next, she was standing on the deck behind him, blood running down the edge of her sword.", "Less than a second later, the Worker\u2019s head fell to the floor. Blood gushed from the stump of his short, thick neck. His body, not yet aware that it was dead, continued forward, still swinging the mace in the exact same manner as the Worker\u2019s first and final attack. Cast\u2019yr was not surprised by the grim spectacle. Even when they had taken fatal damage, a Worker\u2019s body could remain functional for some time.", "It took several moments for Cast\u2019yr to process what had happened; the Broken had launched herself into the Worker\u2019s reach and leapt above her foe in an insanely risky move that would have seen a thousand other opponents like her trampled, crushed, grappled or otherwise fall victim to the Worker\u2019s size and strength. A thousand other opponents; not this one. For this one, there had been no risk at all.", "Finally, the brute\u2019s shambling corpse caught up to the reality of the situation. It collapsed to its knees before crashing heavily to the deck. In all that time, the Broken hadn\u2019t moved a millimeter, poised in artful repose like a dancer at the completion of her routine. Finally, she straightened, her blue eyes sweeping across the assembled soldiers and Unbound. They rose from their seats as one and saluted her in the manner of their cabal \u2013 two fingers (or the equivalent) to the temple \u2013  showing utter obeisance to their monarch, the Red Queen.", "\u201cI feel compelled to point out once again,\u201d Brauz said softly and smugly. \u201cHow often our peers mistake a submission that acknowledges hard-won rank and respect for capabilities for weakness of liver and mere subordination.\u201d", "Cast\u2019yr said nothing for a moment. He\u2019d heard tales of the Red Queen\u2019s martial skill, but never witnessed such a thing directly. He had never doubted that she was a proficient enough killer for her species, but had always assumed a certain latitude with the facts. \u201cI have been\u2026 educated,\u201d he finally replied.", "If the Tribune had been going to respond, it was lost as the Broken monarch spoke.", "\u201cThis didn\u2019t have to happen,\u201d she told her assembled submissives. \u201cAr\u2019kennet was a good officer. Dedicated to our cause, a veteran of many battles and a survivor of Galhemna. His loss diminishes us.\u201d She paused to let her words sink in. \u201cWe did something incredible. We struck the Compact harder than we ever have before, harder than any but their greatest enemies have done. I know what that cost us, too. I know what and who we lost. I know how much we\u2019ve bled and that some of you are uncertain about the future. You have questions. You have concerns. I\u2019ll do my best to answer them, as I always have \u2013 but there are some answers I can\u2019t give. You know this. Because of that, I ask for your patience and your trust. If you can\u2019t give me those, if you have a problem with my leadership\u2026 you have a choice to make.", "\u201cYou take it up through the appropriate channels. You leave. You can even come to me. If you think I\u2019m making a mistake, it is your right and duty to tell me, up to the point of insubordination.\u201d A pause, longer than the previous one, and pregnant. \u201cUp to. Not past it. Not in public and if you keep pushing, if you ignore every chance you get and invoke the old law\u2026 I will oblige you.\u201d She looked back at the Worker\u2019s corpse. Blood was pooling around it. The Broken was silent for several heartbeats, keeping whatever final thoughts she had to herself. \u201cDismissed.\u201d", "The assembled officers got up, filing out of the amphitheater. Some menials brought in a cargo sled and a lifter drone to haul the Worker\u2019s corpse out of the room. Brauz and Ventl led Cast\u2019yr down the steps to where the Red Queen waited.", "\u201cMajesty,\u201d said Brauz with a tilt of his head. \u201cMy condolences for your victory.\u201d", "Adrianna Leblanc, the Red Queen and commander of the Red Hand smiled, flashing a mouth of white teeth. \u201cThank you, Brauz.\u201d Her gaze moved to Cast\u2019yr. \u201cThis is him?\u201d", "The Thoughtful was nearly a foot taller than the Broken, but it still felt as if he were looking up at her. \u201cSpecial Envoy Cast\u2019yr of the Blotted Suns,\u201d he said, introducing himself. \u201cI\u2019ve come at the personal request of the Lady of Shadows to beg an audience with your august self, Lady of Ash.\u201d Ash, Despair, Dreams, Shadows and Whispers. Those were the titles of the Five. Until a few years ago, the leader of Charred Temples had had the Red Hand\u2019s place. Their ruler, the former Lord of Ash, had attempted to assert dominion over the Red Queen and her people. That decision had proven most unwise, with unfortunate consequences for him, his cartel, who had been destroyed by those they sought to conquer, and the rest of the Five who now had to bestow a mere Broken with a title and a position as one of their peers. It was obscene, but even amongst Unbound, there was tradition. You kept what you killed and the Red Hand had proven their strength.", "It was still all too much like inviting a snapping suam into one\u2019s home and hearth, but that too was a thought Cast\u2019yr knew better than to voice.", "\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard,\u201d the Red Queen replied. She didn\u2019t appear exerted at all from the fight, even as brief as it had been. Minor functionaries approached, offering her a coat, which she donned much to Cast\u2019yr\u2019s relief. The bodysuit might be useful duelist's attire, but its form-fitting nature only emphasized the unseemly and alien structure of the smaller female\u2019s body. \u201cI\u2019ve also heard that you have been particularly close-mouthed about what you wished to discuss.\u201d", "\u201cIt is a somewhat sensitive issue, Highness.\u201d", "Cast\u2019yr had never encountered a Broken in person before, but he had studied his host. He believed the expression on the smaller female\u2019s face was intended to communicate a lack of surprise. Her next words confirmed his hypothesis. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. She gestured and the minor functionaries disappeared. Her armsmen remained. After watching the Broken decapitate an enemy five times her size, Cast\u2019yr doubted that they would be necessary.\u201cI imagined it was,\u201d the Red Queen continued, \u201cand you wouldn\u2019t have been brought here if I didn\u2019t believe that it was worth my time. So what does Keru\u2019sa want?\u201d", "The Thoughtful ignored the impropriety of the Red Queen addressing the Lady of Shadows by her given name. That kind of casual disdain for one\u2019s peers \u2013 or betters \u2013 was the kind of thing he expected from both the Red Hand and a Broken. He looked pointedly around the amphitheater. \u201cAs I have stated, it is a\u2026 delicate matter.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re alone, in a high-security facility. My armsmen have heard all sorts of delicate matters before and I haven\u2019t had to kill them.\u201d", "\u201cNot yet anyways, Majesty,\u201d Brauz put in.", "The Broken showed her teeth in a paltry imitation of a Tribune\u2019s smile. \u201cNot yet.\u201d She turned her blue and white gaze back on the Thoughtful. \u201cSo, speak.\u201d", "\u201cVery well. Given recent events within the Veiled Reaches, and the increased and scrutiny upon the fringe caused by your cartel\u2019s operations, a motion has been put before the Five for the censure of the Red Hand.\u201d", "\u201cYou mean that my other four esteemed colleagues are shitting themselves over the trouble I\u2019ve caused and are thinking of handing me over the Compact to save their own hides.\u201d", "\u201cThat interpretation could be made.\u201d", "\u201cYes, it could. But that doesn\u2019t explain why you\u2019re here.\u201d the Broken gestured. Cast\u2019yr followed her out of the amphitheater, into the hallways of Harridan Core. Just before the door closed, he could hear the soft whirr of  machines coming in to clean up the mess left behind by Ar\u2019kennet\u2019s challenge.", "\u201cThe Lady of Shadows respects the Red Hand and Your Majesty\u2019s accomplishments. She knows that of late, there have been several minor disruptions of an otherwise harmonious working relationship between your cartels and she would see this association repaired and strengthened. She would gladly speak on the Red Hand\u2019s behalf to your fellow members of the Five... if she knew that the Lady of Ash held her and the Blotted Suns in similar esteem.\u201d", "The Broken nodded. \u201cAnd how could this be proven to her?\u201d", "\u201cI imagine that it could be done many ways, but the Lady of Shadows is aware of what transpired in Galhemna. She understands the price you paid for victory there was dire indeed, and she also knows that what you took from the system exceeds the value of what you lost.\u201d", "\u201cShe wants some of the ships and cargo I captured.\u201d", "\u201cNot enough to undercut your own success, of course. But such a gift would satisfactorily demonstrate the goodwill and respect that the Red Hand has for the Blotted Suns and the Lady of Shadows. Which she, of course, would reciprocate by urging restraint and patience in this most trying, stressful time. Values that I am certain that the Red Hand would appreciate, given the disarray your fleets and operations are in.\u201d", "The quartet entered a lift car and began to descend deeper into the facility. The Red Queen made a sharp exhalation through her nostrils. \u201cAnd this is Keru\u2019sa just expressing her good intentions towards me and my organization?\u201d", "\u201cOf course, Lady of Ash.\u201d", "\u201cI see. So it has nothing to do with the fact that the Blotted Suns have been pushed out of five sectors in the last year, the Tengalese Consortium drove your Lady out of their territory recently and CIS\u2019s Operation Bath Time has crippled her operations across two more sectors? It has nothing to do with the fact that my good friend the Lord of Dreams has his knife out for Keru\u2019sa, funneling money and weapons into the Evermore Risen\u2019s conflict with the Blotted Suns? A conflict that the Blotted Suns are losing and, according to my reports, in dire need of materiel to replenish their own losses?\u201d She paused to let all that sink in, but not enough to give Cast\u2019yr time to respond.", "\u201cI understand the Risen Empress is a supporter of the Hollow Words. If Fanm could ascend her to become Lady of Shadows, that would be very good for him, wouldn\u2019t it? And very bad for your cartel and Keru\u2019sa, given what traditionally happens to members of the Five who get\u2026 displaced.\u201d", "Cast\u2019yr tried to keep a neutral expression on his face, though he was certain he hadn\u2019t completely succeeded. \u201cI must congratulate the Lady of Ash on the extent of her intelligence network. The Lord of Dreams\u2019s actions were only recently discovered by my own syndicate.\u201d", "The lift stopped and the doors opened. The Red Queen exited. Despite his longer legs, Cast\u2019yr had to hurry to match her pace. \u201cOne day, people will stop underestimating me and my people,\u201d the Broken told him. \u201cApparently not today. Envoy, are you by any chance familiar with Rally\u2019s aquatic life?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2026 cannot say that I am.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s a type of marine predator there. Once blood gets in the water, they go into a killing frenzy. They\u2019ll attack anything that moves, even each other. Keru\u2019sa is one those animals, envoy. All of the Five are. If my other good friends censure the Red Hand and move to attack us, they might win. Might. Even if they did, I\u2019d make them bleed in ways they\u2019ve never imagined, but that\u2019s not the point. The Blotted Suns aren\u2019t as strong as they were even a few years ago. You need that \u2018restraint and patience\u2019 just as much as we do, because if the rest of my colleagues bring us down, blood will be in the water. Do you understand?\u201d", "\u201cI believe I do, Majesty.\u201d", "\u201cGood.\u201d They arrived at the queen\u2019s own offices. A pair of Bloodsworn stood on guard outside, saluting their monarch as she entered. The Tribune armsmen took positions just inside the doors. \u201cBut never let it be said that I don\u2019t give my peers the respect they deserve. I appreciate Keru\u2019sa\u2019s willingness to speak on the Red Hand\u2019s behalf. I will indeed express my gratitude and esteem to her, along with my personal thanks for her efforts.\u201d She held up one finger as if marking a point. \u201cI will also go even farther than what you\u2019ve requested of me.\u201d", "The Thoughtful blinked in surprise. \u201cYou will?\u201d", "\u201cYes. I will overlook her encroachment into my territories in the Kartam Flats, Ericon Spread and the Mori-Thun Expanse. Instead of killing every last Blotted Sun in those regions, I will allow you to continue your soft operations,\u201d \u2018Soft\u2019 operations referred to those that did not, or rarely, required violence such as smuggling, tariff evasion, loan-sharking or protection rackets, \u201cthere. I will also give you one month to shut down the trafficking networks you\u2019ve been attempting to set up rather than taking those responsible, nailing them to the hull of my ship and sending their dying screams to your Lady of Shadows.\u201d", "Cast\u2019yr felt a touch of colour drain from his skin. A mixture of desperation to replace their losses, the belief that the Red Hand wasn\u2019t strong enough to contest those regions and confidence in covert they\u2019d been had pushed the Blotted Suns into those sectors. Traditionally, any cartel reacted poorly to attempts to push into territory that they considered theirs, but the Red Hand\u2019s responses tended to be more\u2026 extreme. Void war was their greatest strength, and the cartel was not shy about using that to make their points.", "The Broken monarch\u2019s words might be a bluff. They also might not. The Red Queen was many things, but she did not issue empty threats. She had no tolerance for slavery in any fashion or form; neither her cartel nor those allied to it carried out the flesh trade. More than one soul who\u2019d violated that edict had died in in the very manner she\u2019d described.", "\u201cYour Majesty is\u2026 is most generous,\u201d he finally said.", "\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI am.\u201d A pause. \u201cIs that a satisfactory expression of my intentions towards the Blotted Suns, envoy?\u201d", "\u201cI believe so. With your leave then, Lady of Ash, I shall return to the Grasp where I can relay this most magnanimous offer to the Lady of Shadows.\u201d It was unlikely he could accomplish his secondary objective, but Cast\u2019yr felt that expediency was now more important.", "\u201cGood. Tell her I hope she appreciates this gift, and that I do look forward to hearing from her in the future.\u201d She smiled again, lips drawing back from her teeth. This time, he had no trouble at all discerning what the woman\u2019s expression was attempting to convey.", "~", "After the Blotted Suns representative left, Adrianna let out a long, slow sigh as she sunk down into her chair, feeling it reshape itself comfortably to her position. Her office here was modest, bereft of the luxury and ostentation that normally came with the position of a crime lord, particularly a member of the Five. She had many opulent facilities across the breadth of her domain, there to suitably impress and intimidate guests with the wealth and power of the Red Hand and its queen.

Not that she expected to spend much time in the system or bring many outsiders to one of her organization\u2019s clandestine construction facilities \u2013 \u2018swamp nests\u2019 in the parlance of the Compact \u2013 but appearances needed to be maintained and with them, all the pomp and circumstance of her lofty position.", "\u201cAn expression of \u2018friendship and respect\u2019,\u201d she said to the empty air, her lips twisting in a sneer. \u201cOf course.\u201d The Red Hand was an anomaly amongst the fringe; a cartel that didn\u2019t consider itself to be one. A syndicate with a cause greater than wealth and power. Those were a means, not an end in and of themselves. A bloody, ruinous means but also a necessary one. The Red Hand wasn\u2019t interested in fortune, material gains or self-aggrandization.

Not due to the AI, but how circumstances had led to Ar\u2019kennet\u2019s death. She had no regrets over the decision she\u2019d made sixty years ago. It had shaped her life since that day, a secret partnership with an engine of destruction, whose hate for the Compact eclipsed her own. No one else in the Red Hand knew of Nemesis. She could call upon any one of dozens of advisors for any situation, be it economic, military or political, people whose counsel she respected and had learned to trust, but in the matter of Nemesis, the Red Queen kept her own counsel. It was a secret she could never share.", "And then, Galhemna.", "The Red Hand\u2019s crucible. More than the Magnameric Canyon or Understone, Galhemna\u2019s fall held so much possibility, both good and bad.

Bold and decisive. Perhaps a little too much; once he set on a course of action it was impossible to get him to change his mind. That had been an asset in the past, his determination and doggedness leading to victory where more cautious commanders would have withdrawn, but it had also led him to picking fights he couldn\u2019t win. Until now, his fellow officers had gotten him out of those situations but today when he\u2019d become  openly insubordinate, he\u2019d lost that support.

Most recently, Andrew had told her to keep it. \u201cBetter that they come right at you,\u201d he\u2019d said, \u201cinstead of going sideways or back-stabbing you.

It would cost a fortune \u2013 multiple fortunes \u2013 to make good all the losses and damage her fleet had suffered, and time to get the prize ships into service, even more time to start re-filling their coffers after draining them to repair, re-supply and rearm. As the elation of victory faded, discontent had started to trickle through the ranks, and not just among the pirates and criminals she tolerated, but within her own supporters. For many of them, it was their first taste of war \u2013 real war, not preying on convoys or ambushing isolated patrols. Learning how devastating it could be and how absolute the mismatch in firepower was between a rag-tag band of insurrectionists and the preeminent military power in the galaxy had been a grim realization for many. They were scared, they were wounded, they\u2019d seen their friends and comrades die and the future was uncertain.", "Many of them had found their resolve, burning brighter with the knowledge that despite the losses they\u2019d suffered,  they could win. Others had been sobered and tempered, aware of how much more work there was to be done. Some mourned for those they\u2019d lost, knowing that it was the Compact and its systemic oppression that was responsible for their grief. Others like Ar\u2019kennet chose Adrianna as the focus for their ire, blaming her for the meat grinder of Galhemna. It was her responsibility, but everyone who\u2019d fought had done so willingly. She\u2019d never promised easy victory or coddled her people.

An act of unmitigated spite that consumed nearly thirty million lives.", "The Triquetran League had had a painful existence. Exile, schism, invasion, betrayal. That was all behind them now.

To say it had been a surprise was an understatement, and its discovery had send shock waves through the Powers That Be. Long-standing plans had had to be altered, discarded or substantially accelerated in the wake of the knowledge that the Asset brought.", "Exploration Fleet was part of those plans and its original construction timetable was all but thrown out the airlock, replaced with an urgency to get Triquetra\u2019s second flotilla up and running as quickly as possible. Triquetra\u2019s people did not have the best experience with surprise visitors from other stars. They couldn\u2019t let such things happen again.", "As one of the first-built keels for Exploration Fleet, Vegvisir had had the honour \u2013 at least, until recently \u2013 of travelling further beyond Nibiru than other ship in the League\u2019s history, a survey mission where the Prophet\u2019s Own Sight had led them to the Asset.

Rasmussen was an older man, broad across the shoulders with thinning silver hair, faded freckles and a long chin. Keating was a stark contrast to his superior; lean, dark-skinned and with very close-cut hair. Rasmussen oversaw all active operations for Exploration Fleet, a field of responsibility that would grow as the fleet itself did. \u201cThank you for coming so promptly, captain.

Consequently, it had been decided that L\u00e1sabrj\u00f3tur would be given the first mission to search for Riding Hood. The Asset had provided three different locations where Riding Hood might be found; Munn had been sent to the Hemlock Nebula \u2013 also apparently known as the Molten Veneer.

At its birth, it had been a symbol of freedom in the face of tyranny. Then it had become weighted with the knowledge that it was a species\u2019s last refuge and final hope.", "Stay silent. Stay safe. Those were the League\u2019s watchwords. For two thousand years, the humans of Nibiru had known that the darkness beyond the light of their sun wasn\u2019t empty, that predators stirred in the depths and they had hidden themselves away, hoping to go unnoticed. At least for long enough, but long enough was no longer possible. Vegvisir\u2019s encounter with the Asset had proved that. Keating and the League\u2019s leaders had seen the danger immediately. Even if the Asset was a single ship, lost and adrift in the wilderness, where one encounter had happened by accident, others could follow by intent. Nibiru\u2019s comforting isolation was no longer either of those things. Within a generation \u2013 perhaps two, if they were lucky \u2013 the Triquetran League would become part of a wider galaxy whether they liked it or not.", "The shuttle was approaching Vegvisir now. Keating smiled as he looked at his ship. It was a Liahona-class cruiser, the third of the line. Exploration Fleet was built according to an entirely different aesthetic and doctrine than Home Fleet, and the Liahonas epitomized sleekness and grace, with elongated hulls that bisected a rounded crew compartment and long drive spars that jutted from the aft section, giving them superior sublight capabilities and improved shift capabilities than Home Fleet. Work on Exploration Fleet had only just begun; less than five percent of it had been completed when Vegvisir encountered the Asset. The plan had called for a slower, measured roll-out over the next two generations, but the League now needed ships and people to crew them in half that time.", "If there was to be contact, it had to be on the League\u2019s terms. That was what this mission was about, why Ophelia and L\u00e1sabrj\u00f3tur had been sent to Hemlock and why Obed and Olaf were going out now. Keating envied Miller. Kong\u014d was returning to humanity\u2019s homeworld, a place no one on Nibiru had ever seen, but his own mission would be no less important. The Procreant Nebula.

There wasn\u2019t even enough time for decompression and overpressure to wreak havoc before 1869-Yiren Orbital shattered inwards.", "Fractions of a second after impact, the upper aboreteum and croplands were instantly destroyed as Wanal Pham plowed through them. The freighter\u2019s forward section was crumpled by the collision and shredded as it drove through the station\u2019s fractured hull, but it was too massive, too solid and traveling too fast to be stopped. Even if it had been completely destroyed, all the kinetic energy from the freighter\u2019s mass would still have gone into the station, pieces of starship hurtling through deck after deck like ad hoc rail rounds.", "Instead, the station\u2019s death came from the more-or-less intact hulk of Wanal Pham as the ship forced itself through 1869-Yiren Orbital\u2019s body like an iron stake through sheet metal. The station folded in on itself, bulkhead collapses and hull breaches destroying whatever the direct force of Wanal Pham\u2019s impact didn\u2019t.

The latter had been lost in a cataclysmic failure while Compact researchers had been studying Hekate\u2019s displacement engine.

He didn\u2019t need augur reports, engineering briefings or technical readouts to know what the bitch-thing had done to this place.

Yunl\u2019ro wanted her sigil vessel and its escrots on active patrol, screens raised and reactors hot.

She was a fine example of Tribune femininity; as tall as her male counterpart though not quite as broad. The tufts on the tips of her ears were smaller and finer, her muzzle was narrower and she had a full mane that covered her scalp rather than the natural mohawk of Tribune men. She was a light brown in contrast to Nasham\u2019s grey skin, her dark eyes possessing a slightly violet hue.

Not to the same extent that he once had. Invida had been so traumatic that he\u2019d welcomed a security mind-wipe, but the Bequeathed incident had broken through that. Nasham had refused even the possibility of another wipe after that; he said he never wanted to forget again, but there had been a toll on his mental health.", "The woman put one hand on Nasham\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll stop her.\u201d", "Nasham blew a snort through his nostrils. \u201cI suppose so,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI\u2019m just wondering what the cost will be.\u201d", "\u201cThings are changing.

That was part of the reason he was taking this sojourn from Light of Judgement. His presence had been requested aboard Oath of Steel. Not by the Bastion Leader; she was still reviewing Maur Tan\u2019s reports and the progress of their investigation into the incident. Security procedures would have to be examined, transcripts and interviews of on-duty personnel, analysis of the responses made to each stage of the attack, from the attempts to intercept Aswang Experience to the efforts made to stop \u2018Gravestone\u2019 from escaping.

Whether or not they had accomplished anything was the question the Bastion Leader sought to answer for herself.", "He could already tell her what happened, but she didn\u2019t need him for that. Months of grinding losses, ambushes and the revelation of horror after horror had reinforced her understanding of their enemy. Still, Yunl\u2019ro was not just a veteran sigil officer in the Space Force, but she was also a Thoughtful.

The latter was explained by his past. The former... more than once, the Wound had returned captives only for them to reveal what had been done to them. The most common method was nanite infestations that turned their host into a flesh-puppet, with the person completely unaware of what had happened to them. Sometimes their own wills were over-ridden, leaving them trapped inside their own rebellious flesh. Other times, the corruption was so thorough that they never understood that they were betraying their comrades or \u2013 most worrying of all \u2013 claimed that they\u2019d chosen to do so. Cruder, earlier attempts had been discovered through changes in personality but the machine learned and adapted. In some cases simple, straightforward brainwashing was all that was necessary.

She had helped him recover from Bequeathed and he in turn had proven that he wasn\u2019t just a rambling, damaged madman.

Vinsea flashed him a knowing smile. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one with networks, Nasham. I\u2019m still an intelligence officer and the presence of an Inner Councillor in the wilds gets around.

The species was small \u2013 this woman was just over five feet in height and perhaps only a quarter of Nasham\u2019s size \u2013 slight and descended from tree-dwelling rodents but they had eidetic memories, making them exceptional living recorders. The Didact\u2019s normally bushy tail was trimmed close, as was much of her fur. Tribunes were sensitive to some species\u2019s hair, Didact and Broken most of all. Nasham was not one of them, but members of those species who worked in close association with Tribunes often trimmed their hair or were completely shaved for the comfort of their superiors.", "The Tribune let himself be led through Oath of Steel, passing work teams, officers and crew. There was a kind energy and intensity to the activity here and it wasn\u2019t just due to the ongoing repairs. None of these men and women had ever expected this kind of attack. Even after Galhemna, they\u2019d believed that they were \u2018safe. The Wound\u2019s assault had shattered that illusion. Nasham understood their reaction. The last time he\u2019d felt safe was Invida, when he\u2019d questioned why an out-of-the-way archaeological research center needed so much protection. He hadn\u2019t believed that the planet was under any threat. Until the day that the skies turned to fire.", "He hadn\u2019t truly believed in the concept of safety since.", "The Didact made several attempts at small talk, but Nasham wasn\u2019t in the mood and she soon opted for discreet silence. It wasn\u2019t the issue of conversing with a member of a client race that had soured his humours; Maur Tan was bringing back too memories. The last few months had been nothing but constant reminders of what his enemy was capable of. This was just the latest atrocity in a long line of them.", "He was soon brought to the executive wing of the citadel, where the higher-ups of the military and civilian echelons worked, passing through multiple security checkpoints to reach his final destination: the governor\u2019s offices. Two pairs of bodyguards; one for the governor and one for Nasham\u2019s uncle stood outside the chambers with professional, perpetually neutral half-scowls on their faces as they examined everyone who approached. The Didact was barely acknowledged, but Nasham was given nod a nod and a \u201cWelcome, submissive. You\u2019re expected.\u201d With that, the doors slid noiselessly open and Nasham entered the gubernatorial office. It was a large, well-furnished room, but he doubted it saw much use. He was given to understand that most government work was done on Casrca below, though with the damage caused by falling debris and the need to better coordinate within the system, the governor had moved his headquarters up to Oath of Steel.", "System Governor Itibrm Aaeelnaou was seated behind his desk, with a small half-circle of military officers and underlings around him. The Governor was a Judiciary, the first non-founding species to be made a full member of the Compact. More than five thousand years ago, the Algassi people had been saved from extermination; ever since that day, they had been staunch supporters of the Compact, re-named Judiciaries in honour of their work in assisting with and developing the legal framework of the growing nation.", "The species were strangely built, with short, wide-set lower legs and two sets of arms; the larger pair branched from their shoulders: thick, strong but with poor dexterity. A second, smaller set of limbs were folded against their chests, poking out through appropriate openings in their clothing. They had short snouts filled with many small, sharp teeth, three sets of specialized nostrils and a long tongue with a flexible larynyx that allowed them to produce an extremely wide range of vocalizations, making them natural linguists. They were covered with short, stiff fur ranging from blue to grey to green in hues; Maur Tan\u2019s governor was a pale blue. Their large eyes sat close to the crown of their heads, giving them an excellent span of vision and sensitivity to motion, but relatively poor visual resolution. Their ears were cup-like and well-suited to determining the origin of sounds.", "Itibrm was surrounded by a half-dozen officials; ranking military officers and important members of his administration, with a smattering of aides and adjutants around them. A viewscreen set into a shelf was active, with a Column Leader standing next to it, clearly in the midst of a briefing.", "Sitting opposite from the governor and his coterie of hangers-on, advisors and military personnel was Nasham\u2019s uncle, Councillor Yunn (and fifteen names besides). He didn\u2019t have as quite as impressive an entourage; a pair of aides stood behind his chair, taking notes and making observations about the meeting to discuss with their superior later. As ever, Yunn wore an immaculate suit, but he had added an accessory: the palms of his hands rested on the smooth, rounded metal head of a cane. Nasham was surprised. When he had last seen Yunn, his uncle hadn\u2019t needed one. He suspected he didn\u2019t need it now, either.", "Nasham\u2019s uncle might be the single most important individual across several hundred light-years. He was a member of the Compact\u2019s Inner Council, the souls who directed policy and shaped the nation\u2019s growth and future. Only the Triarchs themselves held more authority than those elected to the Inner Council. Yunn himself was the Councillor Predominant of War, a very powerful position and one more important than others during an Age of Expansion. In the wake of the disaster at Galhemna, he had come out to the Veiled Reaches on a fact-finding mission to give his peers his personal observations on the aftermath of Galhemna\u2019s fall and its ramifications for the Compact\u2019s military plans.", "There was more going on here than that, though. Not every member of the Inner Council knew the truth of the Wound; Yunn was truly here because of her, to see and evaluate that situation firsthand. He had a small army of investigators, analysts and support teams at his command and even more resources should the situation require them. His presence here in Maur Tan could be a very good thing for Governor Itibrm... or very, very bad.", "\u201cHello, nephew,\u201d he said with a nod, turning his head towards the younger man. \u201cThank you for coming on such short notice. I apologize that I\u2019ve pulled you away from your duties, but I wanted your perspective.\u201d The older Tribune saw the confusion on the faces of the governor\u2019s staff; kin or not, a group leader, submissive was a very junior officer to bring into this kind of meeting.", "\u201cI\u2019m certain Bastion Leader Yunl\u2019ro would have been pleased to assist you, Councillor,\u201d Nasham said respectfully. Yunn liked his nephew. When he was younger, Nasham always rejected any nepotism or favours from Yunn and had little interest in exploiting their connection. A rare thing in that family. Even now, the officer was uncertain whether his presence was due to Yunn\u2019s influence or not.", "\u201cYes, I believe she would have but the Bastion Leader has a lot of duties and I felt secure that I could borrow one of her officers, particularly given your familiarity with the subject matter.\u201d Yunn\u2019s four eyes twinkled and he looked back to Governor Itibrm. \u201cMy nephew will be joining us for the rest of this briefing.\u201d It was said politely and pleasantly, but it was not phrased as a request.", "\u201cOf course, Councillor,\u201d Aaeelnaou said in a conciliatory tone, believing that Nasham\u2019s presence here was due entirely to his relation to Yunn, fully prepared to humour the Councillor Predominant\u2019s nepotism.", "Nasham saluted the other military officers. He got half-hearted responses or simple nods, those men and women coming to the same conclusion as the governor. Unhappy at the breach of decorum, but wise enough not to directly show their disapproval in front of the Compact\u2019s Councillor Predominant of War.", "\u201cPlease,\u201d Yunn said with a nod to the column leader standing next to the viewscreen. \u201cI\u2019ve held us up far too long already. Column Leader Opot, if you will?\u201d", "The man, another Tribune and easily a half-century or more Nasham\u2019s senior turned back to the presentation. Yunn listened politely, though half his attention was on his nephew. As Opot provided an overview of Maur Tan\u2019s  responses to the incursion, he showed imagery of the Wound \u2013 Gravestone to the Maur Tan leadership \u2013 arriving and taking fire. Nasham stiffened.", "\u201cA moment, Column Leader,\u201d Yunn said, raising one long finger. He didn\u2019t believe his nephew\u2019s reaction was due to seeing the machine. \u201cCould you repeat that?\u201d", "Opot half-bobbed his head. \u201cOf course, Councillor.\u201d He nodded to a subordinate and the data track rewound. \u201cAs I was saying, we can see from this telemetry that the damage inflicted upon the intruder was sufficient to-\u201d", "Nasham had been clenching his jaw so tightly that it was aching, seeing the self-satisfied faces of the men and women here, congratulating themselves even as they preened themselves for his uncle\u2019s accolades. He tried to hold it in, but a response slipped from his lips before he could stop himself. \u201cPiss.\u201d", "The column leader paused. All four eyes narrowed as he focused on the group leader, submissive who\u2019d spoke out of turn. \u201cPardon, submissive?\u201d He stressed the younger man\u2019s rank very carefully, but the reprimand in it was unmistakable.", "Nasham opened his mouth to immediately attempt a retraction and apology when he saw his uncle\u2019s expression. Instead, he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s all that that was,\u201d he explained. \u201cPiss. You pissed on her and thought it was Hemsha\u2019s blood. She was probably laughing at you all the way out-system.\u201d", "Opot\u2019s muzzle wrinkled, his expression darkening at Nasham\u2019s insolence. He looked to his superior, Maur Tan\u2019s ranking sigil officer, for permission to put the younger upstart in his place. In normal circumstances, the column leader wouldn\u2019t have thought twice about answering such disrespect directly, but Yunn\u2019s presence changed the equations.", "\u201cAnd what,\u201d the Bastion Leader said icily, \u201cis your experience, submissive?\u201d", "Before Nashm could answer, Yunn held up a hand to silence him. \u201cMy nephew is uniquely qualified in this matter,\u201d he informed his hosts. \u201cDespite his rank, by authority of Force Command, he was specifically attached to Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro to provide the value of that experience, the nature of which is classified. I\u2019m sure you understand, but suffice it to say that Group Leader, Submissive Nasham has the support and confidence of his superiors, including Bastion Leader Yunl\u2019ro. I am interested in hearing his thoughts. So, submissive, if you would care to elaborate on that rather... colourful description?\u201d", "Nasham nodded. \u201cOf course, Councillor.\u201d He pointed to the data tracks on the screen. \u201cFirstly, that\u2019s not battle damage. The hostile is venting plasma to mimic it and confuse targeting systems, either blinding thermal augurs entirely, or making attackers believe that she\u2019s damaged more heavily in those sections than she is. She either draws fire away from actual vulnerabilities, or lures her foe in when they attempt to exploit it. Considering what happened to your destroyer squadron Zathron, it was obviously the latter. Furthermore-\u201d", "~", "\u201cYou enjoyed that,\u201d Yunn said as he walked alongside his nephew, his cane tapping on the polished metal deck. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been one to shy away from calling out fools with privilege, no matter how often your parents tried to teach you otherwise.\u201d", "\u201cNot when their arrogance could get more people killed,\u201d Nasham agreed. \u201cNot with her.\u201d", "\u201cIt,\u201d Yunn corrected. He disliked how some officers anthropomorphized the Wound. Nasham did it far too frequently for the politician\u2019s liking. The older Tribune hadn\u2019t said anything during the meeting, as it gave the Maur Tan party the impression of a ship leader and not a machine. \u201cI do appreciate your candor, though. I had suspected that Governor Itibrm was attempting to, let us say, embellish how well his forces came off in the encounter. I dare say that I enjoyed the counter-points you provided.\u201d", "\u201cYou didn\u2019t need me for that,\u201d Nasham replied. \u201cThe Bastion Leader is just as well-versed in our quarry as I am, as are many of her tactical and intelligence divisions. They could have all given you the same information.\u201d", "\u201cPerhaps, but it was also an excuse to see you. My mission will take me all over this sector. It\u2019s good to see a familiar face, particularly one that I don\u2019t have to worry about sniffing my feet as I pass. Besides,\u201d the older Tribune smiled. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t deny an old man some of the few joys he has in life, would you?\u201d", "\u201cAre you talking about seeing me, or using me to discomfit your hosts?\u201d Yunn could have easily requested an officer from Light of Judgement of higher rank, or even asked for a meeting with Yunl\u2019ro and her staff to get their perspective on what Maur Tan was telling him. Instead, he\u2019d summoned Nasham. The younger man might have his Bastion Leader\u2019s support, but his relationship with many in her command staff was... rocky, for the exact reasons he\u2019d so amply demonstrated earlier. He was willing to press harder than many other officers when the Wound was concerned and he wouldn\u2019t let anyone, no matter their rank or station, underestimate the human AI. His propensity for calling out what he saw as wrongheadedness had never been directly insubordinate \u2013 but it had often danced along that line.", "Yunn chuckled. \u201cI think your directness might have ruffled their manes, but Bastion Leader Samv is a capable enough officer. He just needs a shock to get his brain working now and then. I can promise you that he listened to what you had to say, and that\u2019s what I needed from him. His subordinates will fall in line, and the governor will follow his lead. I think they\u2019ll be much better prepared in the future.\u201d", "\u201cAre you expecting her to return?\u201d Nasham doubted it. The machine would strike somewhere else next time.", "\u201cNot presently. But...\u201d Yunn trailed off, his lips thinning. A normal pattern of behaviour for the Wound was to attack until it was so badly damaged that it had to withdraw. Years, decades or even centuries could pass between these erratic and unpredictable outbursts of violence, but since the Echo platform had joined it and the abominations had made off with nearly a hundred ships from Galhemna, things were different. He could feel it in his liver. The situation hadn\u2019t just changed; it had escalated. At the worst possible time \u2013 as it had so amply proven with what it had done to Galhemna and the Compact\u2019s plans for a relatively swift end to its conflict with the Askanj Principality.", "\u201cBut she will,\u201d Nasham finished. \u201cShe\u2019s not finished with us yet.\u201d", "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe it is,\u201d the older man confirmed. \u201cI think we will see more Maur Tans in the coming months.\u201d", "\u201cAnd our response will be?\u201d", "\u201cMore ships are coming,\u201d Yunn assured him.", "\u201cYou\u2019ve told me that, but I have to ask: from where, uncle? Galhemna\u2019s losses were catastrophic. Where else can you bring battle-ready forces from before the Wound and her sister burn every system in the Veiled Reaches?\u201d", "The Councilor shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t say more right now. Have faith, nephew. Have faith in me, in the Compact and in the Triarchs. Something is happening that could, at last, end this ugly chapter in our history.\u201d", "Nasham was silent for several moments. I wonder how many times that\u2019s been promised? The Wound had survived two millennia of stratagems, plots, ambushes and every other attempt to kill it. What was happening now that could be any different? He didn\u2019t press further, though. He knew he wouldn\u2019t get anywhere. \u201cI hope so,\u201d was all he said. \u201cI truly do, uncle. She has to be stopped.\u201d", "\u201cIt will be,\u201d Yunn assured his nephew. \u201cIt will be. But for a change of topic \u2013 I will be in the system for several more days before my work takes me elsewhere. I expect I\u2019ll spend much of that time gathering information from Maur Tan and your execution force, but I would like to set aside at least one dinner to allow us to catch up.\u201d", "\u201cI would like that.\u201d", "\u201cGood, good. Oh \u2013 and be sure to invite that intelligence officer you like so much. I\u2019m quite interested in knowing a little more about the woman who can get through that dour shell of yours.\u201d", "\u201cMore strings to pull, uncle?\u201d", "Yunn barked a laugh, tossing his cane up and catching it easily in one hand. \u201cAs I said, an old man needs his joys.\u201d He stopped, putting a hand on Nasham\u2019s upper arm. \u201cI\u2019ll have Loppilli contact you to set up a time. Take care of yourself.\u201d", "\u201cYou as well, uncle.\u201d", "~", "\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Anna Proctor asked her husband. They were in the upstairs master bedroom. Anna had donned a form-fitting dress that turned from blue to silver depending on how the light hit it, while Charles was in a fashionable black suit, his jacket draped over the back of a nearby chair as he stood in front of the mirror, struggling with his tie. His outfit was a modern re-interpretation of traditional human formal wear. Charles wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about it, but it was what was expected so he went along with it.", "\u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d", "\u201cReally.\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t sound convinced.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019ve been trying to tie your tie for the last five minutes. You don\u2019t usually get fumble-fingered. Not with those surgeon\u2019s hands.\u201d Anna liked to make that joke. Usually it brought a small smile to Charles\u2019s face. Today, it felt brittle and false on his lips. The woman stood up from the bed. \u201cHere, turn around.\u201d", "Charles turned away from the mirror to face his wife. She was several inches shorter than him and took hold of his tie. Grace had taken more after her mother\u2019s than she had Charles, with the same colour hair and facial structure, but their daughter had still had his eyes and taller build. \u201cYou\u2019ve been bothered since that agent came by,\u201d she pointed out. She was right. He hadn\u2019t been himself since Barnswell had come calling. The agent\u2019s visits hadn\u2019t just opened up old wounds, but put salt in them, too. He\u2019d called the local branch of CIS to get some kind of update or clarification about their investigation, but had been palmed off with platitudes and assurances.", "\u201cThere,\u201d Anna said as she finished. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d She straightened his collar. \u201cYou clean up nicely, Mr. Charles. You look like a doctor now and not a hobo.\u201d", "He smiled back at her. \u201cWhat would I do without you?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019d probably be squatting on your haunches and eating raw meat with your bare hands.\u201d Her eyes twinkled, her fingers running along his collar and then his shoulders. \u201cYou know, we don\u2019t have to go out tonight\u2026\u201d", "\u201cNo, we should. It\u2019s an important event for the hospital. I should make an appearance. Besides, it\u2019s a good chance for you to network. I know the ECO could use some extra help, and giving is always in fashion.\u201d Anna had scraped together a mixture of savings, loans and charitable donations to expand on Kiel Point\u2019s Envoy Child Outreach program. The Brutes were notoriously difficult to work with, but she spent time with them when she could, both at the free clinics and at her own practice. She\u2019d been able to do minor miracles with them through physical therapy; she had all but pioneered how to adapt human kinesiology for Brute physiology, and several of them even preferred to speak with her over state-approved counselors and confessors.", "These days she took almost as many Verrish clients in as she did others. It had cost her some prestige and more than a few paying customers, but she enjoyed the work much more. She said she felt like she was making more of a difference. Charles still had some concerns about the project \u2013 not all the Brutes were like Allyria \u2013 but he supported his wife. \u201cWe can\u2019t disappoint everyone.\u201d", "Anna smiled, a little sadly. Charles was only half-right: charity was always fashionable, but only the \u2018right\u2019 charity.  Brutes were hardly ever in vogue. It was easier for the powers-that-be to talk about the \u2018duty of care\u2019, \u2018responsibility held by more civilized beings\u2019 and \u2018charge of guidance for the less-developed peoples\u2019 when it came to the Verrisha than to follow through. She shouldn\u2019t think that way. The Compact had done so much, both for humanity and the Verrisha. They were trying to help an entire generation from the species move past old, counter-productive and obsolete attitudes and cultures. It wouldn\u2019t \u2013 couldn\u2019t possibly \u2013 be easy or without problems and both sides were still finding their way through the process.", "It was hard not to look into the faces of the young men and women she worked with and think that the failures weren\u2019t as much on their side as she was told, though. To see so much promise and possibility turned to bitterness, criminality and the wreckage of young lives and wonder whether it was true that Brute culture and their mental outlooks was intrinsically at odds with civilized development, or maybe it was the Compact that had let them down. She didn\u2019t say that to anyone but her husband though.", "Anna pushed those thoughts away. Tonight would be a night of smiles, professional politeness and gentle corrections to the people she was trying to get support from, pretending not to be offended at the stereotypes and jokes she\u2019d hear about the Verrisha. If it would get her extra funding for the ECO, she could nod along and play the game. Technically, it was terribly gauche to push her own agenda at the hospital\u2019s own events, but Charles was a senior member of the board and Kiel Memorial\u2019s director had supported her work in the past. Mostly for his own reasons, but he had let the guests know that their pockets might be leaving a little lighter than expected.", "They\u2019d titter and ask all the questions she was used to dealing with, but in the end she hoped that she could convince a few to pry their checkbooks just a little bit further open. She preferred working with \u2018her\u2019 boys and girls, but she was more useful in putting her connections to work. \u201cI suppose not,\u201d she agreed ruefully. \u201cBut when we get home, can we talk more about this?\u201d", "Charles nodded. He pulled on his jacket, looking as dapper and handsome now as the first time she\u2019d saw him. \u201cAre you ready, Mrs. Proctor?\u201d", "She took his offered hand. \u201cLead the way, Mr. Proctor.\u201d"]}

It was rich in helium-3 and noble gases, its rings and satellites ripe for mining. Four of its many moons were even large enough to hold concentrations of heavy elements and one of them was even life-bearing, with an atmosphere, magnetosphere and active core. It was a strange world, with even stranger forms of life but it was not totally inimical to habitation. There were even suggestions that some of the strange \u2018rock formations\u2019 observed during lunar surveys were the ruins of a long-dead species. Semtillian, it was said, was a world of secrets, tempting and tantalizing but unreachable \u2013 at least by those of law-abiding intent.", "The planet\u2019s ownership \u2013 and therefore the rights to its plentiful natural resources and scientific value \u2013 had been in dispute for more than a century as two different corporations and a private estate waged bitter legal warfare over it, its wealth and its many mysteries. So far from normal spacelanes, there seemed to be little urgency in the matter and the court case ebbed and flowed as challenges, appeals and counter-suits bounced the issue of ownership back and forth. The rest of Approsa, not nearly as valuable as Semtillian was open space, but few were interested in potentially embroiling themselves in the legal conflict. Without Semtillian, Approsa was no more valuable than many other star systems, few of which promised as much trouble. Until the court case was resolved and all rights and responsibilities regarding Semtillian were delineated, Approsa was given a wide berth by legitimate colonists and industry.", "In the meantime, wildcatters, pirates, grey marketeers, unscrupulous corporations and others to whom legalities were merely suggestions found cause to visit Approsa and Semtillian for their own purposes. Illegal mining craft filled their holds full of processed asteroids as strip-mining complexes were dropped upon moons, gas miners trawled the planet\u2019s atmosphere and curio-seekers explored the shimmering fungal forests of the moon Vanalh. If the world and all its secrets did not belong to anyone, they reasoned, then it must belong to everyone.", "Colonies started to grow from rustic work camps and temporary dormitories into towns and beyond, eking towards true squatters\u2019 cities and drifts as fortune-hunters came to plunder Semtillian or to make their profit off of others. Trade increased, a grey economy formed and continued to grow, attracting even more visitors to the system. Such a state of affairs couldn\u2019t last, and the burgeoning civilization in and around Semtillian soon came to official attention. Spurred on the hectoring demands and political influence of all three claimants in a unique gesture of solidarity \u2013 for what were they fighting over if it was already stolen out from under their very noses? \u2013 the sector government took action, and a response to the widespread encroachment was quickly forthcoming.", "The Space Force adjusted its patrol routes to pass through Approsa. The show of force worked as intended, scattering the largest and most brazen of the squatters and illegal settlers, but the Compact was currently engaged in fierce fighting with the nearby Torvis Collective. Their main concern was preventing the build-up of Unbound forces so close to their supply lines and Local Command cared little about the civil issues and minor trespasses occurring in and around Semtillian. As long as the locals didn\u2019t raise their heads too high or grow too bold in their illegalities, they would stay well down on the Compact\u2019s list of priorities. In time they would be attended to \u2013 hopefully long enough to make their fortune with ill-gotten gains and be away before the Space Force\u2019s baleful eyes shifted from quashing the Collective to \u2018stabilizing\u2019 Approsa.", "Thus, although Semtillian\u2019s exploiters were checked in number and confidence, they never went away entirely, though now it was with a careful eye on their augurs and a watchfulness for unwelcome attention. Better that they had looked down to the clouds of Semtillian and within the rings, the old spacers said. Better that they had been more concerned with events far closer to them than the Space Force. Better that they had never awoken the Ghost of Semtillian.", "Some said the Ghost had always been there, pointing to incidents and strange phenomena that hearkened back to the very beginning of Semtillian\u2019s visits. Others said the Ghost had arrived later, roused by the greed and rapacious thievery of those who approached its world with impious designs. Some said it came from the rings, others that it came from the crushing depths of Semtillian itself. Still others said that it had risen from the surface of Vanalh, pointing to the moon\u2019s fabled \u2018missing mountain\u2019 as proof. In the end, there was as much consensus on where it had come from as might be expected from a collection of rumours, half-truths, exaggerations and outright lies.", "The theories of what the Ghost was were just as varied. It was a curse upon those who\u2019d taken what did not belong to them. It was the wandering, wrathful souls of the planet\u2019s long-dead civilization, it was an ancient defence system accidentally activated, it was one of the Unbound seeking to drive their competitors away, it was the Compact testing new technologies upon the inhabitants here... or it was nothing but stories seeded by malfunctioning scopes and bored crew, germinated with narcotics and drink and finally sprouting in taverns and meetings among crews. The descriptions of the Ghost varied wildly, but there three things each of the tales shared in common. It always sang before it appeared, it was a hue of shimmering silver that glittered like ice in sunlight and if you ever laid eyes upon it, you would die.", "That\u2019s what the old spacers said, anyways.", "~", "Liam Redfeather, \u2018Lucky\u2019 to his teammates, reached up in Roman Sky\u2019s cramped, single-seater cockpit to flick the comm on. \u201cRoman Sky to Unmistakable Threat Display.

You have any problems?\u201d", "\u201cNope, Sky\u2019s packed with her hold full of Vanished artefacts.\u201d The discovery of a fallen civilization on Vanalh was old news; the first relics had been discovered over forty years ago. Shortly after, roads had been uncovered, as had other signs of a technologically-developed species. Carbon dating put all the discoveries well over eight thousand years old. In lieu of any other name and as a play on their point of origin, the inhabitants were simply called the Vanished. The interesting thing though (at least as far as Liam was told) was that the Vanished couldn\u2019t be native to Vanalh. The moon\u2019s life was at far too early a point in its development; in the human lexicon, Vanalh was still in the Paleozoic era. Even if it were possible for a tool-using to have arisen so soon, the artefacts that had been discovered couldn\u2019t have been made by anyone native to the moon.", "Theina had a much better head for this kind of thing, and she\u2019d go on at length about it. The best Liam could do was nod along. He had picked up a few things from her, though: the entire basis for life on Vanalh wasn\u2019t sunlight like on most other life-bearing worlds, but the heat and radiation from Semtillian. The largest sources of illumination on the moon came from bioluminesence; it was light, not sound, that was the primary means of communication on Vanalh and that (somehow \u2013 this was the point where he always got lost) precluded the development of certain types of technologies and tools that had already been discovered. He didn\u2019t know one way or the other, but just accepted what he was told.", "The short of it was, the Vanished weren\u2019t native to the Approsa system. They\u2019d set up a colony on Vanalh almost ten millennia ago, for purposes unknown. There was no indication that they\u2019d ever tried to exploit Semtilian\u2019s wealth, not in the ways that a space-faring civilization fuelling a new colony might. Then one day, they\u2019d lived up to their name. Maybe they\u2019d just abandoned the moon. Or maybe they hadn\u2019t. Liam didn\u2019t know, couldn\u2019t have said and didn\u2019t particularly care. It wasn\u2019t his business.", "Almost all trace of the former inhabitants were long gone, grown over by moss forests and fungal trees that dissolved stone, ceramics and metal as they reached radiothermic fronds towards the sky. It had taken decades to move beyond theory to proof, but hope sprung eternal and all that work had paid off for someone. Still, Vanished aretfacts were few and far between. Most of them had destroyed by the passing of centuries and Vanalh\u2019s environment as it reclaimed the land the Vanished had settled on.", "Until now. Eight months ago, a rogue archaeological team, following up years of research, had discovered a small Vanished habitation \u2013 deep-shelter bunkers that had been largely, although not altogether, spared the predations of time. There was nothing living in them. A few had never been inhabited or abandoned like the rest of the planet. Others had been breached by millennia of microbial gnawing and filled with anaerobic growths. Whatever had been within them had rotted away to nothing. Liam had heard that one had bodies within it, but it hadn\u2019t been fully breached. The risk of exposing the sealed bunker to the outside environment and losing the remains demanded caution before proceeding, but the other intact sites were being exhumed.", "Most of the devices discovered within those were long since run down, depleted or otherwise rendered nonfunctional. Those bare few that had been protected enough to remain functional, or could be repaired were hardly going to revolutionize any fields of research. Liam had seen one of the working items: it was an auto-cooker. He had one of those in his quarters aboard the Unmistakable Threat Display.", "\u201cExcellent. Good work down there.\u201d", "\u201cHey, I just fly the ship. It\u2019s everyone else who did the hard part.\u201d The value of Vanished relics wasn\u2019t because of any superiority over current technology; it was intrinsic. They came from a species no one had ever heard of, one that was long departed from the universe. Black-market dealers in, and collectors of, antiquities would pay exquisitely well for such things \u2013 so much so that Vanished artefacts were quite literally worth killing for. The bodies even more so. Even if they had been illegally obtained, there would be hundreds if not thousands of scientists and researchers salivating for the chance to study a new species.", "The archaeologists had known about the Unbound activity in and around the Approsa system, and they had contracted a mercenary consortium, the Brightland Shields, to provide protection for their people. When the value of the dig became apparent, the Shields started to think that they were entitled to a larger share of the profits and when their employers rebuffed them, the mercenaries reached out to the Proliferate Claws to arrange \u2018a more equitable profit sharing structure\u2019. The Claws had agreed, sending in a wetworks team to \u2018assist in transitioning on-site management\u2019.", "That wasn\u2019t Liam\u2019s concern. He was just a pilot, and he\u2019d brought Roman Sky down when it was all over. His job was to ferry freight back to Unmistakable Threat Display. He didn\u2019t set policy or make decisions, he just did his job and did it well. Anything else was outside the scope of his duties and he didn\u2019t get involved.", "\u201cNo false modesty allowed here, Broken.\u201d", "\u201cOkay,\u201d Liam grinned. \u201cMaybe I did do a little good.\u201d He was a competent pilot \u2013 more than competent, actually \u2013 and he could navigate through Semtillian\u2019s orbital paths and massive, icy rings like few others in the Claws could.", "\u201cThere you go.

As he did so, the bottom fell out of his stomach.", "\u201cWhat is that? Can you clean it up?\u201d That was Leader Thanto, gruff and harsh in bearing, but a fair-minded officer. Liam liked him. After Liam\u2019s second mission with Roman Sky, (previously known as \u2018the grave-maker\u2019 after two crews had died aboard it) went off without a hitch, it was Thanto that had given the human his nickname, and it had stuck.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know, leader.\u201d Control answered. \u201cIts extremely garbled.

They were unquantifiable, impossible to understand. Focusing on them made his head swim and a sense of vertigo swept over him.", "Liam had been working in space for almost a decade. In that time, he\u2019d met nearly every species in the Compact.

This wasn\u2019t like anything he\u2019d ever experienced before. Steersmen vocalizations could range into the infrasonic. Locators could emit sounds in a pitch too high for humans to perceive. He knew that there was more to language than the comparatively tiny spectrum of sound Broken could perceive and that much of it could have powerful and unpleasant effects on other species. Even with all of that, he still wasn\u2019t prepared for what he heard coming from his host ship\u2019s bridge.", "Acid burned his throat and mouth as he retched, struggling not to vomit over himself and the controls. His heart was pounding, his breath catching in his throat. His muscles tensed, feeling as if they were about to snap, his head pounding. He\u2019d never felt like this before, sick and pained and terrified and more all at once. God, what is that? Whatever the effect it had on him, it seemed to be worse for the crew of Unmistakable Threat Display.

Liam spat up on himself. There was intense pain behind his eyes, like the noises were trying to push their way out of his skull. It felt like he could actually see the sound, like he was having a synesthesic seizure.

There was warm wetness between his legs and he swallowed back a mouth of blood and stomach acid in embarrassment.", "It took a moment for his mind to fully clear, and then several seconds more to realize that he wasn\u2019t hearing anything at all from the comm now, only the faint rustle of dead air. \u201cControl,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is Roman Sky. I\u2019m here. What\u2019s happening?\u201d", "No response.", "\u201cUnmistakable Threat Display, this is Roman Sky. Respond, please.\u201d", "Nothing. He check the comm panel, then paused. Display was on the other side of the planet from him; they\u2019d been using a relay drone to communicate. The link was down. Not between him and the drone, but between the bulk cruiser and the platform. He tried a third time and still received no answer. Before he could make a fourth attempt, the drone went off-line completely.", "Liam gunned Roman Sky\u2019s engines, pushed back in his chair by the g-forces as the shuttle arced around Semtillian. He didn\u2019t know what he was doing. His instincts were screaming at him to stay where he was, let Thanto and his ship handle... whatever was happening, but he couldn\u2019t do that. That sound... there was something wrong in it. It wasn\u2019t a booming threat or snarled challenge from another Unbound prepared to fight for territory. It wasn\u2019t the clipped, arrogant demands of the Space Force towards an \u2018illegal\u2019 operation. The Principality wouldn\u2019t have come here at all. It didn\u2019t even sound like language. He didn\u2019t know who would have made that God-awful transmission. No one would.", "Except one, a dark corner of his mind whispered.", "He didn\u2019t think on that, telling himself this was most likely just cartel conflict. He was seconds from Semtillian\u2019s horizon and the freight shuttle slewed around the world, its refurbished inertial dampeners only somewhat abating the g-forces, but after what he\u2019d just experienced, Liam scarcely noticed. Then, Roman Sky completed its burn and...", "...and...", "Where is everyone?", "Liam stared at his displays, blinking in confusion. He was expecting to find Unmistakable Threat Display under attack. Since the Compact had upped their presence in Approsa, competition for prime mining or scavenging spots had increased. Another Unbound faction must have heard about the Claws\u2019 score and was making a play, or they were just trying to earn a new place in the pecking order. Either way, they would have bitten off more than they could chew.", "The Proliferate Claws weren\u2019t the biggest cartel, but they were strong enough, with a core of a few heavily modified vessels to act as enforcers and heavy commerce hunters. Unmistakable Threat Display was one of those, a bulk cruiser with reinforced armour, additional point defences and more than a third of its cargo space hollowed out for additional weapons and munitions storage. It had a surprise punch and had given more than one attacker an unpleasant epiphany.", "Instead of the firefight he expected, Liam found nothing at all behind Semtillian. He didn\u2019t even see Unmistakable Threat Display, not at first. Then he looked at his sensor board and saw a splash of heat and radiation along with hundreds of contacts. Debris. That was a dead ship \u2013 at least, what was left of one. He brought up an enhanced image. He swallowed, his face losing a shade of colour.", "There was no mistake; that ruined hulk in front of him was Unmistakable Threat Display. During his time serving the Proliferate Claws, Liam had seen a lot of derelicts. Some wrecked through mechanical or technical failures, shot until they were crippled hulks, vessels that had been broken apart by attack or disaster, or simply expanding clouds of vapour. He\u2019d never seen a vessel killed like this before. The Display had been... it looked like it had been butchered. Liam couldn\u2019t think of another word for it, like twelve hundred meters of starship had been shredded as neatly as a hunter back on Rally field-dressing a tusked stag. He checked for distress beacons. Nothing.", "There wouldn\u2019t be any survivors. Unmistakable Threat Display had died too quickly for anyone to evacuate, and it was too thoroughly mutilated for there to be anyone living aboard. Liam still looked, but his attention was quickly drawn away from the ruin of his ship.", "The wreck of the Unmistakable Threat Display wasn\u2019t the only thing out here. There was something else. Something moving. He stared. Roman Sky\u2019s scopes couldn\u2019t get a clear read. The contact\u2019s mass and power estimates were fluctuating so wildly that they might as well have been useless. It wasn\u2019t any kind of jamming he\u2019d seen before, almost like he was staring at something that wasn\u2019t completely there. He could see it, though. A tiny, glistening speck against the dark blues, violets and greens of Semtillian. With an unhurried grace, the second vessel was dipping towards the gas giant\u2019s cloud tops. He zoomed in and swallowed.", "Oh God.", "It was a bright silver, like it had been taken by a master jeweller and polished to a gleam. The reflected hues of the gas giant\u2019s clouds played over its hull, giving a flowing pattern of blues, greens and violets across the silver. He couldn\u2019t have said how big it was. At a guess, at least as large as Unmistakable Threat Display had been. It was an elongated, rounded delta with strange hull projections; loops, spires and sickle-shaped spines all bedecked its hull. It didn\u2019t look like any ship he\u2019d ever seen before, almost like it had been grown rather than built.", "It was the Ghost of Semtillian.", "Even as his mind struggled with that atop everything else he had experienced in the last few minutes, the other vessel disappeared, fading from sight like a mirage without even the expected distortion of a ship engaging its shroud. It just vanished. In seconds, there was no trace of it or indication that anything had ever been here at all... nothing but the remains of his ship and the thousands of souls that had been aboard it.", "As he sat in the cockpit, Liam sagged back against his chair, looking at the gutted wreck of Unmistakable Threat Display. His comm pinged with an incoming signal. It could be a distress beacon, a life pod \u2013 someone might have survived! He opened the channel, opening his mouth to respond. He closed it just as quickly.", "A whisper of horrifically familiar unstatic rustled through the shuttle\u2019s cockpit, a sinuous, interlaced disturbingly melodic cacophony of grotesque sounds that nothing should have ever been able to make. Among all of that, three words came through in perfect Compact Standard, three words that turned Liam\u2019s blood to ice.", "\u201cI see you.\u201d", "~", "Forty-two days later:", "Liam awoke with a start, rolling out of bed, clutching the edges of the mattress and panting. Sweat, cold and unpleasant, coated his face, chest and back. It dripped though his dark brown hair, running down his neck. He closed his eyes, focusing on the sound of the white noise generator he\u2019d kept by his bed for the last month. The soft, calming static helped drown out the noises in his head.", "There was movement behind him as Theina stirred, the Didact woman sitting up in their shared bed. She slept naked and leaned against him, her soft fur pressing against his damp skin. \u201cYou had the dream again.\u201d", "Liam nodded. \u201cIt was bad this time.\u201d It wasn\u2019t every night, but it was often enough. Ever since Unmistakable Threat Display had died.... No, that was wrong. That wasn\u2019t it. The loss of his ship and everyone aboard it played a part, true... but it was those sounds. What it had sang to Thanto and the crew... and what it had said to him. He couldn\u2019t get them out of his head. Every time he closed his eyes, every time it got too quiet, they rose to the surface, sitting amidst his thoughts like poison dripping into a well. The only thing that worked was drowning them out. \u201cSorry. Didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d", "Theina chirred dismissively, her long, bushy tail flitting back and forth. Their relationship was an odd one, but not unlikely. There was only one other human across this entire sector, and Theina and Liam knew each other well. Her fur was a light hazel, her features softer and not as angular or quite as, well, rodent-like as the rest of her species. Liam wasn\u2019t sure if that made her more or less attractive to her own people, but it worked for him. He\u2019d tried growing out a beard for her, but she said it made his face too rounded and his hair was too wiry and coarse compared to her fur. She liked touching his skin, finding it strangely pleasing. Definitely an odd pair, but they worked.", "\u201cCome back to bed,\u201d Theina told him.", "Liam looked at the clock. He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m fine now. I have to be getting up soon anyways. You should get some sleep, though. You\u2019re working a double shift. Get some rest. I\u2019ll get ready and you\u2019ll have lots of time to shower and dry off.\u201d", "Theina grunted in acknowledgement, dropping back onto the mattress. She pulled a pillow under her face, her dark eyes closing. \u201cHate double shifts,\u201d she said, already half-asleep.", "\u201cI know,\u201d he replied as he got up, heading into their small shower stall. The water started to run, the sound of it filling Liam\u2019s head and drowning out the chorus inside his thoughts.", "For a little while, at least.", "~", "\u201cHurry it up, \u2018Lucky\u2019! Shake the shit out of your boots! We got three more bays to unload and then another ship after that!\u201d", "Liam wasn\u2019t flying any more. These days, he worked the docks on Approsa Drift, a quasi-legal station cobbled together over decades of dubious travel and trade within Approsa. The drift sat in the sunward asteroid belt in what the locals called the \u2018plausible deniability zone\u2019. Even though most of Approsa\u2019s other worlds weren\u2019t nearly as valuable as Semtillian and its moons, the station\u2019s location was more convenient to the rocky inner worlds and the sole gas giant circling closest to Approsa itself.", "There had been an asteroid colony, Semtillian Orbital. Built almost four decades ago by the syndicates and traders exploiting Semtillian, it was now part of the great blue world\u2019s rings, blown into fragments by the Space Force when they\u2019d first come to brandish the sigil. Almost everyone had gotten off in time; the only casualties had been a handful of thieves who\u2019d stayed too long to loot what others had left behind and a pair of elderly traders who\u2019d insisted that Semtillian Orbital was their home and they weren\u2019t going to be chased away. Unfortunately, they\u2019d forgotten that the Space Force didn\u2019t bluff. They\u2019d issued their warnings and weren\u2019t going to waste time dragging squatters and Unbound off the asteroid.", "Without Semtillian Orbital, Approsa Drift was now the center of commerce for the system, and it was starting to draw in more law-abiding souls and ships, much to the chagrin of many of the old-timers here. \u201cThat\u2019s how it starts,\u201d they\u2019d complain. \u201cFirst, good honest Unbound like us do all the heavy lifting and then the civilized folk come sniffing for coin and little by little we don\u2019t have leaders running things, we have bureaucrats who want to keep trade coming and start squeezing us out.\u201d Whether or not that was true and whether or not it was a good thing, it at least made for steady work.", "The Proliferate Claws were investing in Approsa Drift, increasing their presence in the system. Scuttlebutt was the court case over Semtillian was nearing a critical juncture and the cartel was positioning themselves for when the planet\u2019s new proprietors needed anything. They\u2019d have the people, the networks and the infrastructure already set up. It also helped to dispel any suggestions of weakness in the wake of Unmistakable Threat Display\u2019s destruction. Technical error, that was the official reason. What kind of technical error destroys a ship like that? What about the comm logs and telemetry from Roman Sky? Liam had asked. He didn\u2019t get any answers. It was like the rest of the syndicate didn\u2019t even care. They wanted to believe that it was a technical error and they didn\u2019t want to hear a Broken\u2019s insistence to the contrary.", "So Liam no longer had his shuttle. It had been assigned to the Tapestry of Teeth, even renamed. He\u2019d been put here on Approsa, shuffling cargo around all day in a heavy loader with a cockpit that wasn\u2019t designed for Broken anatomy. It was hard, gruelling work. His shiftmates alternated between not wanting anything to do with him for fear of his bad luck, and heaping scorn on the Broken who wasn\u2019t as good at his job as they were.", "His nickname, given to him by a noted leader within the Proliferate Claws, was now an insult. Every time he screwed up, it got thrown back in his face. None of it hurt as much as what he knew for himself, though. He was \u2018lucky\u2019. It was just that none of it seemed to be good luck now. Not since that ugly day a month ago.", "Faster, faster, faster. All day, every day. That was his new credo. Faster, faster, faster. It could have been worse, though. It could have have been quiet.", "So he did everything he could in his job as well as he could, trying to get through each day even as he wondered how it had all happened. He kept coming back to the same answer day after day, too. Because of the Ghost. Because something killed his ship and his friends. He couldn\u2019t let that go. He couldn\u2019t just say it wasn\u2019t his business. He had to know what happened.", "Hopefully before his luck finally ran out.", "~", "Theina worked in Approsa Drift\u2019s finest hospitality center \u2013 though finest was a relative term \u2013 earning money for the Proliferate Claws, just like Liam did on the docks. Liam had originally worked for a small Rally-based shipping company that had tried to expand too fast and had to sell off its assets, including many of its workers\u2019 contracts. A shell company for the Proliferate Claws snapped up some of them; experienced ship crew were always in high demand, even if they were Broken.", "Theina\u2019s story wasn\u2019t exactly the same; she\u2019d been bored and wanted a way off her homeworld, signing up for \u2018host and hostess services\u2019 with an entertainment venue. The agents there had been shady, selling their clients\u2019 contracts out to even less-reputable organizations and the Didact now had to work in a very different manner than she\u2019d originally envisioned. Neither of them were slaves; they were paid a good wage and once their contracts expired, they would be free agents (with options for renewal; depending on how useful you were, those discussions could go anywhere from substantially improved compensation, a simple farewell, or to an open airlock). They could even buy out their contracts early if they so wished. It was expensive though, and the Proliferate Claws, like many cartels and even companies, charged their contract workers for lodging, for food, for amenities, for medical coverage and all the other fees and surcharges that they could think to pile on to make sure they got their money\u2019s worth from their employees.", "Liam didn\u2019t particularly care. Working for the Claws was much like working for anyone else. It was a job. Theina hated every moment of it, though. She told Liam that she only managed to stay clean because of him, otherwise she\u2019d be using whatever she could make her forget what she did at work. She was trying to save up to buy out her contract. He suspected she was even skimming from her tips to do so, which could get her in a lot of trouble at the club. He worried, but he didn\u2019t ask her about work. She never wanted to talk about it. The first thing she did whenever she got back to their apartment was take a shower.", "After Display\u2019s loss, Theina started sharing things with him \u2013 the people in the club who talked about the Ghost, what they said. None of them were eyewitnesses like he was \u2013 he came up a lot, she told him. There was even a wager on how long it would take before the \u2018ghost\u2019s kiss\u2019 claimed him like all the others. She hadn\u2019t wanted to share that, but he\u2019d gotten it out of her. She knew that he was desperate for anything at all about the Ghost, no matter what it was and she was trying, in her own way, to help.", "He wished he knew if it was helping him, but he didn\u2019t have anything else to go on right now. At least until the day she gave him the worst kind of help. The kind that gave him a direction.", "~", "Avena Ilthaonav, quartermaster of the Evidence of Ruin liked doing three things while he was taking shore leave on Approsa Drift. He liked gambling at the casinos, he liked spending coin in Theina\u2019s hospitality center and he liked drinking at the Black Eyes tavern. Evidence of Ruin was a clan-less Unbound pirate and it had been working Approsa and the surrounding systems for decades. Its crew had seen and done almost everything in and around Semtillian.", "Almost everything. \u201cIf we\u2019d seen everything we wouldn\u2019t still be around, now would we?\u201d", "No one had seen what happened. Not a single one of the other ships in Approsa had been in position to observe Unmistakable Threat Display\u2019s final moments, and all other relays or augur drones had been similarly blind, or had gone off-line just like the comm buoy. If there were any records, nobody was willing to share them or even admit that they existed.", "On the face of it, it was insane. How could a starship die so violently with no one seeing a thing and without there being a single a trace of its killer? He\u2019d offered to pay someone to take him out far enough from Approsa to intercept the light from Unmistakable Threat Display\u2019s death. The first few pilots had refused and word had gotten around to the rest. He tried to play dumb, but they were on to him. They either tried to be diplomatic and insisted that there was nothing to see and they weren\u2019t going to waste their time and his money on a varak chase, or they were blunt. \u201cI\u2019m not risking a ghost\u2019s kiss for you, Broken. Your ship is dead. Either call it an accident or don\u2019t, but leave it here. You\u2019re already marked \u2013 don\u2019t try to take anyone else with you.\u201d", "He couldn\u2019t accept that. How could this happen for decades? Someone at some point must have have seen something. Someone must have survived. Someone. They had to. That hope was all he had to go on.", "\u201c\u2018course they have,\u201d the drunken quartermaster told Liam one night when the Prolocuter had been so far into his cups that he hadn\u2019t cared that he was sharing a table with a Broken. Unlike many other establishments, the Black Eyes didn\u2019t discriminate in its clientele. All they cared about in their customers was that you had coin and were willing to spend it there. Even a Broken\u2019s money was still money \u2013 though the cover charge to get in was higher for Liam than for most. He had no trouble finding Ilthaonav and the large alien was intoxicated enough that he seemed more amused than insulted by a Broken\u2019s presence. As long as Liam paid for his drinks, the quartermaster was happy for company. He was even willing to talk about the Ghost of Semtillian \u2013 at least enough to make it clear that he wasn\u2019t going to talk about it. \u201cYou spend enough time in space and you see strange things, boy. Especially here in Approsa.", "\u201cBut the difference between you and everyone else is that they\u2019re smart enough to keep quiet about it. Smart enough not to be asking questions that don\u2019t need answers. Smart enough not to talk about things they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d He\u2019d belched and leaned forward. \u201cThey\u2019re smart enough not to risk your bad luck rubbing off on them. No reason they should die too, right?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s been more than three months,\u201d he\u2019d answered the larger alien. \u201cI\u2019m still alive.\u201d", "\u201cAnd what do you think that means, boy?\u201d One of the Prolocutor\u2019s large fingers pointed accusingly at Liam. \u201cYou lower species think that if something doesn\u2019t happen right away, it won\u2019t happen at all. That\u2019s why you need us. You don\u2019t have patience or the smarts the Triarchs believe you have. You especially, boy. You\u2019re marked with the ghost\u2019s kiss. That doesn\u2019t end well. A day, a week, a month or a year. The ones who\u2019ve been kissed never get away. Your clock is winding down boy, and all you care about is arguing with the cog-maker. Go back to your quarters, get your Didact to shake her tail for you and enjoy the time you\u2019ve got left.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve seen the records.\u201d Liam didn\u2019t want to admit it, but the Prolocutor wasn\u2019t far off. Everyone who\u2019d claimed to have laid eyes on the Ghost of Semtillian was either dead or missing. And, fair enough, a lot of those incidents were... unsettling or unusual in nature. Others, though... \u201cIf the ghost has to use a bar brawl to kill someone or disappear its targets after they embezzle money from the Spire Eyes, then it\u2019s not that supernatural, is it?\u201d", "\u201cDead is dead, Broken. Do you really think those people cheated fate because they died with a knife in their backs on a tavern floor instead of out in space?\u201d Ilthaonav gestured and the bartender came over, re-filling his drink. She didn\u2019t even look at Liam. \u201cYou wonder why Evidence of Ruin is still here, still working a cursed system like this one? It\u2019s because we\u2019re smart, boy. We have simple rules to work around Semtillian. We don\u2019t get too close to the planet. We don\u2019t poke our snouts in where they don\u2019t need to go and we don\u2019t listen to the songs.\u201d He pointed a finger at Liam. \u201cHow many of those did your Leader Thanto ignore?\u201d", "Avena took a deep drink from his mug, looking back at Liam and smiling in the way of his species. It was a not a gesture humans found comforting. \u201cYour time is running out, \u2018Lucky\u2019. You might not believe in the Ghost\u2019s curse now, but maybe you will when it comes for you.\u201d The Prolocutor laughed to himself. \u201cThe ghost\u2019s kiss doesn\u2019t lead to a natural end, boy. Not a single soul who\u2019s laid eyes on it has gotten away.\u201d He paused, multifaceted eyes looking past Liam. \u201cWell, maybe one of them.\u201d He laughed. \u201cIf you call that a life.\u201d", "\u201cWhat? What do you mean?\u201d It took the last of the Liam\u2019s money to pry the answer out of the now-very inebriated Prolocutor, but in the end he was successful. Liam wasn\u2019t the only person on the drift with the ghost\u2019s kiss.", "As he walked out of the bar, Liam took a moment to lean against the wall, a flush of excitement running through him. Someone else. There was someone else on this station that had seen the Ghost. Someone else who was still alive. He had their name, and he was going to find out just what was haunting the Approsa system. He was going to get to the bottom of this, no matter what. Even if it killed him."]}

At least, that was the best explanation Red One had for her behaviour. Lakhesis had taken her appointed berth in Reginn and while she hadn\u2019t uttered a single complaint, there was a certain tone to the style and frequency of her updates. Schedules indicating how long her ship-self would be laid up, and how that would impact the Fleet\u2019s military operations both within and without the Black Veil and the preexisting construction/modification schedule. New power distribution estimates showing the expected output that would have have to be diverted from primary and tactical systems to life support functions. Mass penalties caused by taking on additional cargo, foodstuffs add other necessities to maintain organics. Predicted degradation of combat acceleration and maneuvering capabilities to prevent g-forces from killing Lakhesis\u2019s intended crew. Tactical simulations of the strike cruiser pre- and post-refit comparing estimated differences in combat efficiency.", "Red One acknowledged each update, but her orders stood. Despite her tendency to focus on a single end of a Bell curve of outcomes, Cerulean Two\u2019s analyses were accurate. There would be, from the AIs\u2019 perspective, a noticeable difference in her ship-self\u2019s functioning once she was carrying organics. ", "It didn\u2019t change anything. Lakhesis would be getting a crew and when Red One felt her offspring was getting a bit too petulant in her datadrops, she responded sharply. Logically, Cerulean was right. The presence of organics and everything needed to maintain them wasn\u2019t at all necessary for any of the Fleet. Whatever tangible benefits that they brought were far outweighed by their disadvantages. They were fragile, slow and required both attention and resources to maintain. From a purely logical analysis, they were a detriment to a properly-run vessel. Red One was not a being of pure logic, though. The value of an organic crew was not measured solely in what they brought to combat and systems efficiency, and Cerulean Two needed to learn that. ", "This is not solely our war. We fight to avenge the lost, and that includes so much more than our own kin. You need to understand that, little one.", "Cerulean Two attempted to appeal to Echo for support, but found just as little traction with the other AI as she did with Red One. Perhaps even less. Though Echo had killed her ship-self\u2019s original crew and all but gutted Redemption of Sol during her modifications, she had kept her life support systems, even modifying them for human and Verrisha specific needs and comfort. She wasn\u2019t as verbose as her sister and her responses to Two\u2019s entreaties were the cybernetic equivalent of a noncommittal \u2013 though somewhat smug \u2013 shrug. ", "So Lakhesis was left in her berth, her ship-self partially peeled open as Reginn\u2019s arms worked inside her and swarms of service drones crawled over and within the strike cruiser, completing, adjusting and improving systems that had never been finished, nor ever really expected to be. Systems that Cerulean Two maintained were wholly superfluous for her to have, let alone use. And while all that was happening, she sulked.", "Red One had shared her perspective on organics with Cerulean Two, but just as Two had shared the experiences that led to her self-awareness with her siblings without bringing them to full sapience, Cerulean Two did not feel the same resonance of the other AI\u2019s memories and emotions. They were Red One\u2019s, not hers and despite all that information, she still didn\u2019t understand Red\u2019s fondness for non-synthetics. Even the older AI agreed that organics were less capable, less durable and less effective than an AI or expert drone system, but she kept them around nonetheless. ", "Two accepted that her \u2018mother\u2019 and \u2018aunt\u2019 had different perspectives on organics, but they just didn\u2019t mean as much to her. She\u2019d never known Earth, never carried a crew, never spoken to Captain Sudoki or any of the Red series\u2019 original creators. The Long War was no longer humanity\u2019s battle to fight. The torch had passed, and now it was the Fleet\u2019s to carry. She had nothing against either Lieutenant Proctor or te Neu. In fact, she respected their commitment and the sacrifices that they had made to fight the Compact\u2026 but they didn\u2019t belong here and shouldn\u2019t have been aboard any Fleet vessel. Certainly not her ship-self.", "If it had been up to her, Cerulean Two would have fashioned a vessel for the organics and let them putter about in ir, or \u2013 preferably \u2013 sent them back to the Red Hand where they could at least contribute to the greater conflict and not be underfoot. Red One had made her decision though, and Cerulean Two would follow her orders. She had, perhaps, spoken a little too flippantly of the value of non-synthetic life. Maybe. Two wasn\u2019t yet convinced that she had, but she wasn\u2019t prepared to wholly discount the possibility. By any metric, she was still young and it was possible that her perspective would change.

But maybe.", "Maybe.", "She\u2019d complete this refit, accept her \u2018crew\u2019 for as long as she needed to and prove to Red One and Echo that they didn\u2019t have to worry about her. Her opinions were rational, based in logic and her own experiences, not in any desire to slaughter any living thing before her like Violet Seven, or an inability to differentiate between hostiles and friendlies like too many of her predecessors. In the meantime, she sent another update to Nemesis. Just to keep her informed. Just in case her mother/commander changed her mind and Cerulean Two didn\u2019t have to go through with the refit. ", "The odds were small, but Cerulean Two had hope. In the meantime, she remained nestled in Reginn\u2019s arms, rerunning her actions in 1869-Yiren over and over again, studying them alongside the mission\u2019s remonstrance and feedback, looking to see where she\u2019d gone wrong. It was currently a mystery, but just like Cerulean Eight had, she hated those. She would figure it out. Eventually. ", "She hoped she would, anyways.", "~", "Light years away, Noble Fleet Lord Jirrico of House Soton-ra looked out the window of his quarters. The brilliance of the Radiant Streams nebula \u2013 what the Compact called the Black Veil \u2013 dominated the view. Three hundred light-years across, and eighteen million cubic light-years in volume, it was a breathtaking array of oranges, reds, yellows, greens and glimmering stars, with even more stellar bodies hidden within its thick dust clouds, pillars of creations and stellar nurseries. ", "It was interesting, he occasionally thought, how the same thing could be so radically different to different observers. There was a great dust cloud, virtually a second, dark nebula that lay between the Streams and the Compact astronomers who\u2019d first seen it so many thousands of years ago, blotting out much of its light and splendour. To those watchers and their civilizations, the Black Veil had been a strange, foreboding presence. The Askanj-anj scientists who\u2019d gawked at the images from their observatories had had no such disruption in their views, and gave the nebula a name more befitting its appearance, holding it up as an example of the beauty and magnificence of space and the wonders that it held. The same thing, but different perspectives.", "There was a lesson in there, perhaps. ", "The Askanj-anj let his eyes drift across the starfield, settling on one point of light in particular. Galhemna\u2019s sun shone constant and bright with not a hint of the violence and furious pitched battle that had consumed millions of lives within its system. It would be years before the light of what had happened there reached Kebrak Daun and even then, none of it would change the nigh-eternal glowing of its star. From here, it was as if such a thing had never happened.", "He grimaced, unconsciously touching the stump of his left elbow. He had lost the arm aboard Exsanguinator in the closing hours of Galhemna and the unexpected arrival of another Compact armada. The neverborn had managed to elude the Triarchs\u2019 hounds, but his fleet hadn\u2019t been able to do the same. He\u2019d had to be carried from his ship by those too loyal to let him die aboard the supercarrier as it and its crew sacrificed themselves to save the remains of his forces.", "Regeneration efforts had failed and he was to be outfitted with a cybernetic replacement, but he had deferred it for now. There were many souls who needed it far more than he. Once they had been attended to, he would take his turn. His fleet, including both supercarriers, had been all but destroyed in what was now being called the Pyre of Galhemna. He\u2019d led six hundred ships into that system and barely a tithe had escaped. By any standard metric, those kinds of losses were disastrous and any noble lord or lady responsible for that kind of massacre would have almost certainly been cashiered from the service in disgrace. In any other circumstance, that would have been his fate as well, if not for the fact that Galhemna had suffered worse. Its garrison, gone. Its palisades, gone, its shipyards, its industry and nearly three thousand warship hulls, gone. The plans that would have led to his nation\u2019s collapse \u2013 gone. All burnt in the Pyre.", "Command was, if not pleased, then at least satisfied with the price they\u2019d paid for all that. In the cold calculus of strategy, it was much more than an equitable exchange and the Principality had gained far more than they had lost. He knew that. He agreed with the assessment, had even argued for Operation Hatchling. Knowing what he had known then, it had been the right decision and he would have made it again.", "It made all those empty berths and unfilled seats ache no less, though.", "The door to his quarters fluted with the announcement of a visitor and Jirrico turned, keying the intercom on. \u201cYes?\u201d", "It was his niece and first aide, Ichcit. \u201cSorry to disturb you, lord,\u201d she began. \u201cBut Exterminatrix\u2019s shuttle is arriving.\u201d", "\u201cThank you, Ichcit.\u201d Ancestors bless that girl. He\u2019d lost track of time. He didn\u2019t used to, but after Galhemna, he hadn\u2019t quite been himself. She also didn\u2019t ask if he required any assistance in getting ready. He\u2019d told her he would get a prosthetic, but until he did, he was determined to do things for himself.  In times past, even with all their limbs intact, an Askanj noble wouldn\u2019t have thought twice about being attended by a servant in such a manner, but the old ways had been old for a very long time. Things changed.", "As he struggled and softly cursed his way into his uniform, Jirrico suspected that that too was a lesson.", "~", "Noble Fleet Lord Tasho of House Rina-tho offered his host a traditional Argosy salute, wrists crossed over the heart; one hand closed and the other open. Determination, a readiness to assist and the willingness to carry a weapon. At least that\u2019s what the modern explanation for the gesture was; the tradition went back nearly five thousand years to the early days of sail upon the Askanj homeworld, so who could say how it truly started?", "\u201cGood to see you, Jirrico.\u201d Other than the expected gaggle of minor aides and assistants, Tasho was accompanied by another high-ranking officer: a female Askanj-illth, the serpentine woman gliding effortlessly along beside the smaller fleet lord. The pair of Argosy officers couldn\u2019t have been more different. Askanj-anj were the founding species of the Askanj Principality, and the most represented in civilian affairs and the nobility \u2013 such as it was, being little more than a title these days. They stood on two legs just under two meters in height, with skin between light pink and maroon, wide dark eyes high set up their faces, noses laden with minute scent pits and mouths with flat teeth that had shifted from snipping and grinding plant tissues to meat as the Askanj\u2019s primeval ancestors had evolved from obligate herbivores to omnivory. Instead of hair or quills, the species had fleshy crests that ran from their foreheads to the napes of their neck that swelled with agitation, excitement, arousal or any other sufficiently strong emotions. Females had a pair of smaller, finer crests, while males had three.", "In contrast to their fellow members of the Principality, an Askanj-illth maiden could reach up to four meters long, most of that being their tail \u2013 which was hundreds of pounds of pure muscle. A blow from an Askanj-illth\u2019s tail could cripple or kill even the hardiest of creatures, and they were unbelievably fast, striking so quickly that even augmented troops had little chance to evade the blow. They could even maintain cross-country speeds that matched armoured columns. It was little wonder that Askanj-illth formed greatest proportion of the Principality\u2019s military. The species was one for whom even the Triarchs\u2019 loyal hounds showed respect, and with good cause. Even Tribune Janissaries and Blackened hesitated at the prospect of engaging the daughters and sons of Henessa.", "\u201cAnd you, Tasho. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d Rising through the ranks, Tasho and Jirrico had been rivals but aside from one or two incidents, it had never been a truly antagonistic relationship. They\u2019d both gotten the postings that they\u2019d preferred and as they\u2019d aged, their blood had cooled and the competition had become more amicable. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be bringing guests,\u201d he said with a respectful nod towards Tasho\u2019s Askanj-illth companion.", "\u201cMay I present Noble Vizier Muddy Little Sneak,\u201d Tasho said with a tilt of his head towards the woman. Her rank was that of an intelligence operative, and a very highly-placed one. She was a bright brown, with sharp yellow banding across her dorsal scales. Her own crest \u2013 more like a spotted frill with thin skin spread between cranial spines than the fleshy latitudinal crests of her countrymen \u2013 lay at rest along her scalp and neck. Her eyes were a citrine hue with narrow pupils, her small nose bracketed by thermosensory pits. Her mouth was closed, hiding her slashing fangs and sharp, slicing teeth. Unlike the Askanj, the Illtharie hadn\u2019t been herbivores who\u2019d widened their palates and ecological niches. They were aggressive, coordinated predators capable of bringing down even the largest prey in writhing packs of teeth and claws (and even animals much like the Askanj-anj\u2019s own ancestors). \u201cShe\u2019s Home Sector\u2019s chief intelligence overseer.\u201d ", "Muddy Little Sneak tipped her head in deference to Jirrico, parting her lips and then her jaws. Decades of service in the Argosy suppressed the instinctive twinge of unease he felt from the gesture. Among the Askanj-anj showing one\u2019s teeth was a threat display. To the Askanj-illth, it was the opposite. Leblanc had once told Jirrico that a human handshake came from the tradition of demonstrating that you didn\u2019t carry any weapons in your hands; an Askanj-illth\u2019s smile had much the same purpose, showing that their venomous fangs were folded back and not ready to be used on you. As the saying went: never trust a snake when you can\u2019t see her teeth.", "\u201cWelcome to Kebrak Daun and Thorncastle. Noble Vizier.\u201d", "\u201cThank you, Noble Fleet Lord. I\u2019ve been looking forward to seeing the system.\u201d", "Tasho introduced the rest of his staff, Jirrico doing the same for his retinue. \u201cI realize my arrival here wasn\u2019t exactly expected,\u201d Tasho said as the group walked through the pallisade\u2019s hallways towards the visitors\u2019 suites. \u201cBut there was only just enough time to send a courier ahead.\u201d", "\u201cHearing that Guardian Fleet Rampart was coming out here was something of a surprise,\u201d Jirrico confirmed, \u201cbut more ships are always welcome.\u201d Operation Hatchling had bled Kebrak Segment and its neighbours white. Defence force and patrols across the segment were either operating at bare minimum or understrength.", "\u201cI imagine so. As long as I\u2019m here, my fleet is at your disposal. Get in touch with my flag officer and set up the deployments you need.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s very generous.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s what you need, isn\u2019t? More hulls to raise the banner and show that Kebrak isn\u2019t an easy target. You\u2019ll be getting more, too. Fleet Laord Carc Eire Thra will be bringing hir task group along with Slaughterstar to Kebrak within the next few weeks.\u201d", "Jirrico blinked in surprise. Slaughterstar was a supercarrier. It had cost the Argosy dearly to provide Purgebringer and Exansanguinator for Hatchling. Now they\u2019d not only brought Rampart from its position, but were pulling more heavy assets from the front lines? \u201cForgive my asking, but... how? Last reports said Carc Eire Thra was launching deep strikes on the Space Force\u2019s bulwarks. I know Kebrak is severely weakened, but Kemk and his forces are in even more disarray. We\u2019re not in any immediate danger.\u201d He paused, unhappy suspicion taking root in his mind. \u201cAre we?\u201d", "Tasho exchanged a look with Muddy Little Sneak. \u201cThere\u2019s been a... development,\u201d he said. \u201cI came here to discuss it with you in person.\u201d", "Jirrico felt his crests tingle. He was well acquainted with the kinds of developments that necessitated this kind of subterfuge. \u201cWhat kind of development?\u201d", "\u201cBefore we get into that, I\u2019ll need a full briefing on Hatchling and its aftermath,\u201d Tasho told him. He held up a hand to forestall Jirrico\u2019s next comment. \u201cI\u2019m not playing dangle-and-chase,\u201d he assured the other officer. \u201cI just need a better understanding of the situation here before I can get into the specifics. I\u2019ve read all your reports, but I need to hear from the people who experienced Galhemna firsthand, and the fleet lord who was there for it.\u201d", "\u201cI suspected you\u2019d want something like that,\u201d Jirrico said. \u201cI already have it lined up for tomorrow morning.\u201d Jirrico gestured and Ichcit sent the meeting information to Tasho\u2019s first aide.", "\u201cExcellent. We\u2019ll get settled in, then. Once that\u2019s out of the way, we can get down to the real business.\u201d", "\u201cI look forward to it.\u201d", "Tasho was quiet, his expression suddenly pensive. It seemed he was about to say something, but abruptly changed his mind. \u201cGood. I am sorry to leave you in the dark tonight, but I promise that tomorrow you\u2019ll know everything I do.\u201d He made a sound. It sounded like a chuckle that died half-way. \u201cIt might even end up that you\u2019ll know more.\u201d", "Jirrico wanted to pursue the issue further, but he wouldn\u2019t get anything out of his peer. Not tonight at least. \u201cYou\u2019ll have complete access to anything you need. My staff is at your disposal if you or your people require anything,\u201d he said instead. \u201cI\u2019ll have local control set up those patrols and deployments for Rampart as well.\u201d And then tomorrow, you\u2019d better tell me what this new \u2018development\u2019 is, or my hospitality is going to become strained. He didn\u2019t need to say that aloud; Tasho heard it clearly enough. The other man gave his host a confirming nod.", "Tomorrow, then.", "Once Tasho and his people were in their quarters and starting their work, Jirrico headed back to his own suite. The stump of his arm had started to ache. That was probably a lesson to heed, too. ", "~", "\u201cLieutenant junior grade Grace Alice Proctor and Lieutenant junior grade Allyria te Neu.

The strike cruiser had much less internal space pressurized and fit for habitation and it recirculated faster than that aboard either dreadnought. Even here in the large shuttle bay, it was a degree or two warmer than on board either dreadnought. The strike cruiser\u2019s primary hangar was much like Nemesis\u2019s, albeit smaller: polished black floors glistened like water under white-blue floodlights, with grey bulkheads. Several other pinnaces and gunships, most lacking cockpits, were moored to gantries or set on the deck. A handful of work drones moved among them, performing basic maintenance or running other errands.

Bisected by the rod was a spinning wheel\u2019s flywheel. Grace had seen the same symbol on Lakhesis\u2019s hull.

Exactly what those instructions were was a closely-guarded secret, but apparently this was the first step on some kind of grand plan. That was how his people told it, anyways. Miguel didn\u2019t believe that.", "Siegland had lived longer than any human should, longer than even his own physicians thought he would, but he couldn\u2019t cheat death forever. There\u2019d been rumours that in the last years of his life his mind hadn\u2019t been what it once was. Lending credence to that theory was that before he died, Siegland hadn\u2019t appeared in public for a long time. Only those of his inner circle had spoken with him for some time since he\u2019d become a recluse\u2026 and they had ever reason to protect his image.", "I wonder why a man who used to be an asteroid baron was talking about doing geological studies after he\u2019d gone \u2018round the bed? No, gotta be something holy and visionary. A last benediction and gift of wisdom from the Prophet, right? For his money, Miguel wagered that those \u2018specific instructions\u2019 were probably nothing more than the incoherent deathbed ramblings of a man who\u2019d long since sunk into dementia.", "Nibiru was currently limited to one major city and a few outlying towns. There was plenty of room planetside to expand, but setting up orbital colonies and lunar facilities would have to happen sooner or later. Siegland\u2019s believers were just using this as an excuse to get their foot in the door and the feathers in their collective cap. Being the first to push for setting up orbital infrastructure \u2013 and getting their own people in early \u2013 would give them even more power and influence on Nibiru. Whether it was genuine belief that that\u2019s what the Prophet wanted, or his inner circle were just using it as fig leaf for their ambition, Miguel couldn\u2019t have said.", "Regardless of the answer, it was a job, he got to spend time with Kate and, apparently him being here was good for the public image. Besides, it kept him off-planet where, apparently, things were going sideways. He regretted not paying closer attention. He should have. He\u2019d have to start keeping an eye on the situation instead of pretending everything was fine.", "Miguel was pulled from his thoughts by a sensor alarm. The deep scans were picking something up. \u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d he mused.", "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d", "\u201cGetting some unusual back-scatter from the sensors. Something hard and fairly big a few hundred meters down. It\u2019s probably just a dense rock formation. Let me re-calibrate\u2026. Huh. That\u2019s just weird.\u201d", "Kate looked at her own instruments. Neither one of the pair could really have said what they were seeing, but there was something under Imbolc\u2019s surface, and it was big. \u201cI\u2019m calling it in,\u201d she said excitedly. \u201cOne of the surface teams will be able to get a better picture once they get on-site.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing, just some magma or heavy metals that was exposed during the split and got buried again. Let\u2019s just log it like the others for the end-of-sweep report.\u201d", "The woman glared at her partner. \u201cI\u2019m calling it in,\u201d she told him, her voice sharpening.", "Miguel raised his hands. \u201cRight, okay. Go ahead.\u201d Kate might have concerns about what was happening, but she was just as much a believer as many others on Nibiru. Sometimes he forgot how strong her faith was. If Henrik said to poke through a moon, then by God Kate and all of his followers were going to do that and then convince themselves that whatever they found, it was all because of him. And the Cult of Siegland keeps on growing. ", "He looked from Kate, hunched over her console and talking in excited, hopeful tones to Control, then back to the moonscape of Imbolc again and wondered, not for the first time, just what the Expedition had come all this way for."]}

Lakhesis\u2019s bridge was, like the vessel itself, a smaller version of Nemesis. The dreadnought had been built as a command ship, and its operations center had multiple tiers descending from the captain and admiral\u2019s stations and stations for upwards of two dozen officers and crewmen, with even more in satellite facilities across the entire command deck. The strike cruiser\u2019s bridge had space for less than a third of that. Even though she\u2019s still the size of a city.", "Just like Nemesis, Lakhesis\u2019s decks were gleaming black, the bulkheads a blue-tinged silver. High-definition lighting shone down from the ceiling, wall and floor running lights.  Everything here was new, even cleaner and shinier than the equipment aboard Nemesis, as if were all nearly built. Which, of course, it was. Only a short time  ago, Lakhesis\u2019s bridge had been little more than disconnected consoles, bereft of even the pretense of accommodations for a crew. Now, it looked as if it had always been like this. Three massive viewscreens dominated the forward bulkhead, their images as perfect as if they were windows. Helm and Navigation were in the front of the bridge; Tactical, Sensors, Operations and Communications up behind them. The highest level on the bridge had the first officer\u2019s station on one side and Engineering on the other. Between them sat the captain\u2019s chair and primary holo tank. Compact vessels overwhelmingly preferred flatscreens for data presentation; the Argosy utilized liquid metal displays, but the Confederacy favoured a combination of flatscreens and holograms.", "Despite the differences between Lakhesis and Nemesis, the strike cruiser still had a sense of familiarity that Grace had come to cherish over the last two years. Chairs, consoles and walkways built solely for human (and Verrisha) scale were the norm on Confederate warships. Whenever she sat down, Grace didn\u2019t feel like a child in an adult\u2019s seat like she had upon Bequeathed or even Pale Liberation. She still felt somewhat small, but less than she had before. She\u2019d commanded a ship in battle on the front lines of the Battle of Galhemna. Now, she was trying to tame an AI. Possibly just as difficult and just as important. Maybe even more so. The AI fleet would never grow beyond Red, Echo and an armada of drones if they couldn\u2019t have offspring that wouldn\u2019t go insane.", "Tyger, tyger.", "Grace smiled slightly. Snobby little tyger, too.", "Lakhesis\u2019s refit took nearly six weeks, an impressive feat given the AIs\u2019 limited construction capabilities and resource base. If they\u2019d had access to a full-service shipyard, the strike cruiser\u2019s modifications could have been completed within a third of that time. Cerulean sulked during the entire process, or whatever the commensurate emotion was for an AI. She was never rude, but always quick to point out the changes she had made for the benefit of her crew.", "This personnel lift system used to be a tertiary magazine draw feed. ", "Environmental systems have been given secondary backups, drawing from Fusion One and Two in place of subsidiary feeds to ventral weapons clusters Eight through Twenty.", "I have been running tactical simulations based on the new limits that my inertial dampeners can operate under.", "She was always polite and her comments were only ever made when the systems in question or the issue of her refit came up, but the AI clearly resented having to carry organics.

She never went out of her way to irritate or provoke her crew. Ironically, a petulant AI had higher standards of behaviour than Grace had gotten from some of her old comrades in the Rally Provisional Space Force. Like that fucker Kilgrave.", "The AI even took criticism without issue. As engineers the galaxy over could attest, \u2018perfect specifications\u2019 did not  translate to perfect operations. The interactions between software, hardware and simple quirks of physics meant that there were always bugs to work out in any system, and Cerulean Two making her ship-self habitable was no exception. If the gravity felt off, if the atmosphere wasn\u2019t quite right or any one of a dozen other parameters weren\u2019t as they should be for Grace and Allyria, Cerulean Two was quick to make adjustments and soon learned to query her passengers to ensure their habitat was comfortable. She might snit about having them onboard, but she was mindful of her responsibilities.", "Though I think she\u2019s just waiting until we get transferred back to Nemesis.", "The AI continued her... parents\u2019? siblings\u2019? (AI relationships were confusing) \u2013 tradition of pushing her crew as hard as she could, running ship defence and boarding assault drills, emergency repair simulations and command operations. At Red One\u2019s nudging, Cerulean Two had even allowed Grace and Allyria to take control of her ship-self to let them get better familiarized with her ship-self and demonstrate their capabilities to the younger AI. Two believed that those particular training missions were irrelevant \u2013 any damage or systems failures severe enough to incapacitate her would surely kill her crew as well \u2013 but she put up with them, admitting that when they were operating her ship-self, Grace and Allyria were \u2018competent, and somewhat more efficient than expected\u2019.", "It was about the best praise that they could get. A full organic crew, let alone just a pair of them, couldn\u2019t match the speed and capability of an unshackled AI. At least she knows we can do something. Odd as it was, Grace actually felt more useful aboard Lakhesis than she did Nemesis or Hekate. Her value, however meager, meant more aboard the strike cruiser than the massive dreadnoughts. Allyria said the same thing. She\u2019d also taken to calling Cerulean Two \u2018leahen ariashtu\u2019, or \u2018young harbinger\u2019.", "Hearing that had given Grace an epiphany of a sort. \u201cLeah,\u201d she\u2019d announced. \u201c\u2018Cerulean Two\u2019 is bit of a mouthful to say every time and I don\u2019t want to call you by a number. How do you like \u2018Leah\u2019?\u201d She\u2019d smiled apologetically at her partner. Allyria had rolled her eyes, but hadn\u2019t objected. Humans might do nicknames, but Verrisha didn\u2019t. To them, shortening someone\u2019s name was ignorant, insouciant or an outright insult.", "Two had mulled it over. \u201cAcceptable,\u201d she\u2019d finally pronounced. Grace wasn\u2019t sure how much the AI actually cared, but it at made talking to her easier. Besides, it might make her feel more included and more likely to connect with her crew. Grace had read Yasmine\u2019s journals looking for insights; Nemesis\u2019s first and only captain had made enough of an impression on Red One that two millennia later, the AI emulated her voice and used her appearance as her avatar. Cerulean Two still used the default vocal settings of the Red series and she had no avatar \u2013 at least, none that she used with her crew.", "Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day, Grace reminded herself. Cerulean Two \u2013 Leah \u2013 wasn\u2019t like Red, or even Echo. Both of them had memories of being around humans ever since they\u2019d come on-line. Red had had her designers, then Sudoki, Sansbury and a hundred and fifty thousand other men and women to remember. Echo never spoke about her original ship-self\u2019s complement; all Grace knew about Hekate\u2019s personnel was what Red One had shared with her.  Captain Carl Holden had been assigned to Hekate and Captain Jolene Archer to Athena. They\u2019d both died aboard their ships during the Fall of Earth. She wondered what they\u2019d been like. The best and luckiest of Earth\u2019s military certainly, trusted with the power of a Nemesis-class \u2018deep space fleet engagement vessel\u2019. She wished she could have met them, the men and women who took humanity into the stars and fought against the greatest power in the galaxy.", "She sometimes imagined a Captain Grace Proctor being counted among them. It was a nice little thought to have. She\u2019d had the same dream on Rally. She\u2019d wanted so badly to serve the Compact and eventually rise to command a ship of her own. The things fate gives us... \u201cLeah,\u201d she said.", "The AI was always quick to respond. \u201cYes, Lieutenant?\u201d", "\u201cWhen Allyria gets here, I\u2019d like to run some more of the Calnian Hegemony simulations. I want to try to get a mission completion rating higher than twenty-five percent.\u201d Allyria was putting in extra time in Lakhesis\u2019s gym. Grace still hadn\u2019t been able to do more than ten chin-ups. Sometimes she came close, but she hadn\u2019t gotten there yet. She\u2019d seen Adrianna\u2019s records from the time the pirate queen had spent aboard Nemesis. It was hardly a fair comparison, since at that point, Red One had already enhanced Leblanc. Grace didn\u2019t use those scores as a benchmark, though. More of a reminder of what she could do \u2013 if she wanted. She hadn\u2019t asked yet. Maybe tomorrow, she used the regular refrain. Maybe tomorrow.", "Leah\u2019s prompt reply ended the young woman\u2019s woolgathering. \u201cOf course, Lieutenant.\u201d There was something in her voice then, too faint to be simulated. Surprise? Pleasure? Pride? Or maybe just amusement to see her crew beat their heads against a brick wall. The Hegemony was a distant, extremely advanced nation, far beyond the borders of the Compact. Red One had said that on the day that those borders touched, she would shed no tears for the Hegemony. Grace had been surprised to hear her say that. Until she\u2019d asked why.", "The doors to Lakhesis\u2019s command deck opened and Allyria entered. Grace turned to greet her, but before either of them could speak, an alert sounded. Without thinking, Grace slid into the sensor station. Four warp points had opened on the edge of Zerzura. \u201cOh,\u201d she said as she recognized the arrivals, a coldness sinking through her stomach. Allyria stood beside her. The Verrish\u2019s eyes widened and she bared her teeth. Terror, the human form divine... but there was nothing human about what had entered Zerzura.", "As much as the Compact was the center of the Long War that Grace and Allyria had become a part of, they were not the only threat in the galaxy. There were other things that haunted the stars, and four of them had just arrived.", "~", "A hundred light-years from what humankind knew as the Procreant Nebula and others called the Black Veil, Vegvisir coasted through open space, navigational fields dimly flickering as nebular dust was shunted from the vessel\u2019s path.  The League vessel had exited shiftspace into this unknown star system, making yet another realspace position check. Still recovering from its emergence back into realspace, its shift systems were spooling back up. Unlike the re-stabilization of a vessel after exiting shiftspace, the recovery of FTL systems took much longer, requiring hours if not days before that ship could make another warp jump.", "Keating knew that the League had done a lot given what they\u2019d had to endure, but they were not bold explorers. At one time, they might have been, but that was before they\u2019d learned how dangerous space truly was. Stay silent. Stay safe. That was how the League had survived two thousand years, but now that isolation worked against them. ", "Beyond a very small area past Nibiru, the only shiftspace data his people had came from historical archives and to say that those were limited was putting it mildly. So much had been lost, and much more had changed. Everything was new now. New... and dangerous. They were in uncharted territory, literally and figuratively.", "Obed was in Conference One, looking out the windows at the distant splashes of light and colour that were Procreant. The lights in the long, curved room were turned down and he was enjoying the view. His ship had been travelling for weeks through poorly-mapped and unexplored regions and during warp travel, they\u2019d drifted off-course three times. Fortunately, though their frequent position checks slowed them considerably, it meant that none of those diversions had been by much. If they\u2019d been making a single long warp jump, they would have ended up a hundred light-years off course, possibly more. If nothing else, this journey gave a crew used to making trips no longer than a half-dozen light-years a better understanding of how vital realspace checks were.", "At least the information they\u2019d gotten from the Asset had made their journey a little easier, but for obvious reasons Keating and Command had chosen to avoid the Asset\u2019s original route. There was less risk of further encounters that way, but even this had yielded surprises: Vegvisir had detected another space-faring civilization in proximity to the Procreant Nebula. It was a small, single-system one with an arthropodal species. Keating would have liked to stay beyond a cursory sweep, but that wasn\u2019t the goal of this expedition. Someone else at some other time would have do that. His interest had only been in determining if these people had any connection to the Compact or Riding Hood. Since neither was the case, Vegvisir had moved on.", "Despite the importance of this mission, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a little disappointed. Exploration Fleet\u2019s whole purpose was to explore and yet they couldn\u2019t do that. How much were they passing by? How many different wonders had slipped past Vegvisir as the cruiser threw itself headlong through the galaxy? He wondered if the men and women of the Siegland Expedition had had similar thoughts as their ships travelled farther and farther from known space. What are we passing by? But they had trusted the Prophet then, just as Keating trusted Brother and Sister now. Locating \u2018Riding Hood\u2019 was the most important thing. The League\u2019s survival could very well depend on it. Just like those aliens, the League would soon become part of a wider galaxy whether they liked it or not, but unlike those creatures, the League still had some choice in how and when that happened.", "The doors to the conference room whisked open. Commander Oksana Fantome, Vegivisir\u2019s XO, entered. She was  part of the same generation as Obed, and only a few years Keating\u2019s junior. She was in line for a ship of her own, but with Exploration Fleet currently more akin to a squadron, she\u2019d been assigned to Vegvisir until a slot opened up. A contrast to Keating himself, Fantome was very slender, fair-skinned and wore her hair long \u2013 though while on duty, she kept it up and out of the way in a neat, coiled bun. \u201cThousands of years ago, when sailors made hand-drawn maps of Earth\u2019s oceans they would put notes on unknown regions or places where other ships had gone missing.\u201d Oksana told Keating as if she could read her captain\u2019s mind. \u201c\u2018Here There Be Dragons\u2019.\u201d ", "He raised an eyebrow. \u201cDid they actually believe that?\u201d", "Fantome shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d She circled around the table to join Keating at the window. \u201cChief Washburne says the shift systems will be ready for another warp inside of three hours.\u201d", "\u201cGood,\u201d Keating nodded. He was on edge and had been since Vegvisir had left Nibiru and that had only grown with each passing light-year and hour. Only L\u00e1sabrj\u00f3tur and Kong\u014d had travelled further than his ship now. The former remained missing with no hint as to its fate, and the latter was headed to humanity\u2019s long-lost homeworld. Obed almost envied Olaf for that, but Sol had not been safe for the Prophet\u2019s people since Earth had demanded its colonies bend the knee and join them in union. If the information obtained from the Asset was accurate, it might even be more dangerous for them now\u2026 but there were few other options. Operation Huntsman had to go ahead. \u201cI\u2019ll feel better when we\u2019re out of open space.\u201d", "Oksana nodded. \u201cI feel the breeze too.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cSilly, isn\u2019t it, sir? The odds of us being spotted aren\u2019t any lower inside the nebula than where we are now. In fact, they\u2019re probably worse. Especially if we\u2019re warping into an active conflict zone.\u201d None of them knew what to expect once they entered Procreant. They had almost nothing to go on. Nothing except...", "Keating pushed those thoughts from his head. The plan was to enter the nebula as far from the Compact\u2019s borders as possible, but their best chance of locating Riding Hood would take them close to those regions and as they did so, the chance of a potentially hostile contact increased drastically.", "\u201cA bit of those primitive mammal instincts kicking in, I suppose,\u201d he answered his first officer\u2019s ruminations. \u201cWe look out at all this emptiness and that monkey brain starts searching for a nice cave to hide in.\u201d", "\u201cWell, an emission nebula does make a decent \u2018cave\u2019,\u201d Oksana agreed. A moment passed, then she spoke again. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got the best odds of finding her.\u201d", "\u201cHow do you figure?\u201d", "The commander cocked her head. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen the historical archives.\u201d", "\u201cI have. I\u2019m just not sure how much we can rely on them.\u201d The League\u2019s knowledge of the wider galaxy was extremely deficient. What data they had gleaned from probes and minor expeditions hadn\u2019t been any more illuminating. Case in point, Keating thought ruefully. We didn\u2019t know what was so close to us.", "\u201cIt\u2019s all we have to go on,\u201d she put in. Then: \u201cI\u2019m at least glad we didn\u2019t go to Hemlock.\u201d", "Keating looked at her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oksana said. \u201cI know you and Captain Munn were close. I knew her too, but  Hemlock\u2026\u201d she trailed off. \u201cIt was declared Lazaretto for a reason, even if we don\u2019t know why.\u201d", "The captain stared out at the starfield, recalling his conversation with Admiral Rasmussen and his superior\u2019s refusal to allow Vegvisir to search for L\u00e1sabrj\u00f3tur. \u201cIf we needed to know, we would,\u201d he told her.", "\u201cWould we?\u201d Fantome questioned.", "Keating frowned. \u201cCuriousity killed the cat, commander. Captain Munn would have been fully briefed on what to expect around Hemlock. Brother and Sister wouldn\u2019t have sent her in blind. If we haven\u2019t been told, it\u2019s because we don\u2019t need to know. Just like she wouldn\u2019t have been briefed on Procreant, but we were.\u201d", "Oksana shook her head. \u201cPirates, terrorists and an aggressive alien empire. We\u2019re jumping out of Nibiru and into all that.\u201d", "\u201cNo risk, no reward, commander.\u201d", "\u201cI know, sir. I know what this mission could mean to the League, but...\u201d she trailed off, her gaze drifting over to the distant splash of colour that was their destination. \u201cHere there be dragons.\u201d", "Keating couldn\u2019t argue with that. \u201cHere there be dragons,\u201d he agreed. \u201cRemind me \u2013 did they ever find dragons?\u201d", "The woman blinked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut I suppose we\u2019ll to find out.\u201d", "~", "Don\u2019t listen to the songs.", "Those five words were often passed off nothing more than story and superstition, but they resonated deeply among certain segments of the spacegoing population. They weren\u2019t the themes of myth or the morals of fables, but advice that had saved many lives over the millennia. There were things that moved through wild space, entities that were every iota the horrors that the Compact claimed lay beyond their borders. The Insatiate Swarm. The Perqueri Collective. The Eaters of the Dead. And, of course, there were the Naiads.", "As far as the Compact was concerned, there was no such thing as a Naiad. None had ever been captured and no one had ever provided compelling evidence to prove their existence. \u2018Naiads\u2019 as they were officially reckoned, fell into one of several categories: unclassified vessels from unknown nations, unfamiliar configurations of existing ships (aided by jamming, inexperienced scope officers and faulty systems), trace data misinterpreted by said officers, and a melange of tavern tales, exaggerations and outright fabrications.", "The Compact had not survived six millennia by being sloppy though, and wherever starships disappeared in higher at average rates or there was compelling circumstantial evidence, an investigation would be launched. On the borders of the Molten Veneer, Red One\u2019s former sanctuary, the Compact maintained a (recently reduced) smattering of outposts and patrols to study the nebula whose reputation had given it a second, darker name: Sanguine Atoll. Here and there, where disappearances, odd sightings and strange transmissions could not be easily explained, the Compact\u2019s patrols and fleets swept through, searching for answers amidst the darkness. Most found far less evocative resolutions to their \u2018Naiad\u2019 question. Ghost fleets, Unbound \u2013 in one instance the missing vessels were discovered to have all had their shockspace navigational software updated at the same waypost, an update that had introduced serious errors into their systems.", "Nearly all other searchers found nothing at all and were forced to give up without answers ,their quarry as hard to capture as sunlight. A few had the misfortune of succeeding in their hunt and stumbling upon the truth. Those ships were added to the rosters of the missing, their wrecks sometimes turning up years, decades or even centuries later, shredded by unknown weapons, their databanks full of static and fragmented, useless records.", "Don\u2019t listen to the songs. Transmissions from vessels that couldn\u2019t exist, voiced by people that spoke in manners just a little off, a little strangely. Promises, calls and lures that drew the unsuspecting or the incautious into the darkness, never to be seen again.", "Naiads. Myths. Stories to share around a bottle, often just to watch the newest members of your crew widen their eyes and whisper questions in hushed, fearful tones. They weren\u2019t real. Not in any way that differentiated them from an Askanj ghost fleet, a particularly creative Unbound cartel, hostile nations or privateers, or far more mundane threats. They just didn\u2019t exist.", "Which means these can\u2019t be here, can they? Red One thought amusedly. Her newest guests were a quartet of Naiads, each only a few centuries old and scarcely the size of a destroyer. Naiad monarchs lived for thousands of years and grew up to a dozen kilometers \u2013 perhaps even larger, but these were young adolescents. Aramburu, Masako, Tamerlane and Bathory. Grace called them the \u2018Neverland Gang\u2019.", "Each of them had a rounded cone of a primary hull, with three forward-curved wings, giving them an exceptionally sleek form \u2013 almost like fighter craft rather than starships hundreds of meters long. Segmented armour plates interlaced with luminescent lines gave them an insectile and almost organic appearance but that, like so much about them, was deceiving.", "Even Red One didn\u2019t know the Naiads\u2019 origins. Space-going lifeforms that had evolved into the current forms, a species like any other that had embraced trans-organicism and become far more than their original selves, a creation of some ancient and forgotten civilization? Each theory was as likely as any other. There was no way of which it was, and the Naiads themselves \u2013 if they even remembered \u2013 didn\u2019t deign to share such things. Even their structure revealed nothing; it was impossible to tell if it was biology that was now indistinguishable from technology, vice versa or some incomprehensible and seamless blending of both.", "The quartet of predator-ships were already accelerating in-system, passing by the picket lines with insolent ease as they transmitted Confederate security codes to the sentinels there. Bathory led the squadron; she was the self-styled leader of the small pack, using her perceived position as the AIs\u2019 favourite to give herself some authority over her siblings. She might very well be; her curiousity with the \u2018Spears\u2019 was a little sharper, a little deeper than that of her kin. There was a bit of Sammuram\u0101t in her.

Naiad language \u2013 True Speech as the species rather egocentrically referred to it \u2013 was even denser than AI communications. Even to minds like Red One and Echo\u2019s, Speech was unsettling. To organics, it was indecipherable and profoundly unpleasant. It wasn\u2019t just words, but emotions, sensations, memories, impressions and more all wrapped in hyper-dense code and gestalt concepts. Telepathy, if it were made with radio waves.", "The young predator-ship\u2019s hail was interlaced with self-satisfaction like the flickers of lightning within a gas giant, and the twinkling of stars as something interposed itself between them and the viewer. Something expected and desired. <your heralds return!>", "<so i see> Red One replied, shifting course and putting her ship-self on a languid intercept vector. In times past, she wouldn\u2019t have been sanguine about the presence of Naiads within light-years of her, let alone the same system. Calling them \u201cexceptionally dangerous\u201d was understating the case by orders of magnitude. Millennia ago, a mass Naiad migration had swept through the galaxy and left little in its wake. Even today with their population much smaller than it had once been, the predators had almost killed the AI several times. Bathory\u2019s pack was responsible for two of those incidents, but Red One had made peace with their faction... of a kind, at least.", "One of the pack\u2019s ruling monarchs, the Naiad queen Zenobia, accepted the \u2018Spearsong\u2019 as an equal \u2013 though a strange one \u2013 and something of an ally. Or at least, the being that had saved her life. That relationship was now strained, and Red had been evicted from her shelter within the Molten Veneer, but it had not degenerated back into hostilities. If it had, Zenobia wouldn\u2019t have allowed her children to accompany Red One and Echo.", "Ostensibly, the monarch had done it to indulge the younger predators\u2019 curiousity (and keep them out from underfoot; Zenobia\u2019s children numbered in the dozens and she was only one queen from one pack in the Veneer), giving them some extra space. Though I know full well she has other motives. The Naiad queen wanted to keep tabs on what Red One was doing, as well as gather information on the wider galaxy. Naiads cared little for the affairs of the creatures they referred to as \u2018deadtone\u2019 and \u2018insects\u2019, but that didn\u2019t make them blind. Through Red One, Zenobia and her pack had learned a lot, and these four of her children had learned even more. That knowledge could be invaluable... but Red One was mindful of what the Naiads might do with it. That was only a potential problem, though. Dealing with a handful of wilful and overly-eager Naiads was a more immediate issue.", "Each of the young predators still sported battle-scars from Galhemna. Though they hadn\u2019t cared at all about the politics of the conflict, they enjoyed killing deadtone constructs immensely. They were healing slowly but steadily, refusing to go near Reginn and its \u2018butcher\u2019s fronds\u2019. Without access to their own infrastructure, the adolescent warships would take some time to fully repair themselves \u2013 a point Bathory had made in unsubtle fashion several times.

Her siblings\u2019 hulls flickered a mixture of blues and greens, the equivalent an eye-roll and rude tongue. Their own missives arrived only seconds after Bathory\u2019s, a deluge of information that even Red One had to take time to sort through. She and Echo had taught them \u2018deadtone\u2019 comm protocols, but when they got excited \u2013 or simply couldn\u2019t be bothered with insect-speech \u2013 they forgot to use them. It was almost child-like, but to apply an organic mindset to a Naiad would be a  fatal mistake. They were not organics, they did not think like or react like organics. Each of them was centuries old, extremely intelligent and exceptionally dangerous. They thought as fast and reacted as quickly as the AIs themselves and their technology was centuries beyond even Red\u2019s finest theoreticals. Even she struggled to understand what their youngest members could do naturally.", "The \u2018Neverland Gang\u2019 might be children, but they killed without mercy and would slaughter planetary populations with the same level of compassion that a human might show towards a colony of ants. And for the same reasons: annoyance, artistry or simply because they could.", "<and did you relay my message?> Red had been told that her accent when she spoke True Speech was inartful; clipped and without melody, lacking much of the nuance and context that a Naiad could convey, but she had no problem making herself understood.", "Hours passed between message and response, but when it arrived, it was filled with Bathory\u2019s chittering.

He rarely raised his voice, even when his blood ran hot and his liver called for it.", "\u201cNothing from our own augurs, patron.\u201d Scopes reported.", "Nanl\u2019s mouth opened in an acknowledging nod. \u201cAnd from our drones?\u201d", "The officer adjusted her instruments, sifting through the data coming from Life-thief\u2019s reconnaissance platforms. A moment passed, but then she half-turned to look at her leader, her lips pulling back from her teeth. \u201cWe have it, patron.\u201d", "The Tribune answered his subordinate\u2019s grin with one of his own. The Bastion Leader\u2019s foresight had paid off. The Execution Force had been scouting the Black Veil for over a year. That was still far too little time to fully map something as vast as this nebula with the resources that they had, but the armada had been scouring the region, searching for means of ingress and setting deadlines upon others. Space might be almost infinitesimally vast, but shockspace interacted poorly with large gravity wells. An emission nebula, filled with star systems, stellar nurseries, black holes and proto-stellar bodies, might as well be a maze of thorns to a vessel wishing to travel through it at anything other than a sublight crawl.", "Those hazards only became exponentially greater the deeper you went into the Black Veil as star systems, pillars of creation and other astrographical phenomena became more tightly-packed. Safe shockspace routes longer than a handful of light-years became harder to find and those that did exist were turbulent and risky to use. Compounding the problem Gravestone\u2019s raiders; scouting efforts were frequently attacked, making even simple mapping missions potentially lethal.", "More than a handful of the execution force\u2019s vessels had been lost not because of enemy action, but became casualties of the unpredictable and uncharted shock routes. It was a problem, Nanl was disgusted to admit, that affected the warships of the Space Force more than Gravestone. They moved through shockspace here like sure-footed opamp climbing their mountains.", "But.", "But Gravestone were only better at navigating the snarls and thorns and were not exempt from all concern. They still had to follow the same rules and strictures of shockspace as the Space Force, and that was why Life-thief had lain silent in this system for months. The Black Veil was not a castle with a single gate; it was a sprawling expanse 18 million cubic light-years in volume and hundreds of light-years across each facing. You could enter the nebula from any point on its periphery... up to a point.", "The increasing density of the countless thousands of stars within such a comparatively small region made normal faster-than-light travel through the Black Veil impossible. The Space Force\u2019s starships were forced to make tiny, cautious shocks as they wriggled their way through the nebula, charting every star, every rogue planet and every gravity well, just as they noted each eddy, riptide and cascade within local shockspace. Even in well-charted territories, the other realm was not kind to the unlucky, the foolhardy or the overconfident. Here in the Veil, it was a tangled, unpredictable, surging nightmare waiting for the smallest of opportunities to crush a starship in its tides and hurl its broken bones back into realspace, if it didn\u2019t swallow it utterly.", "As the Bastion Leader had probed the inside of the nebula, paying dearly for each system and the knowledge of this hostile terrain, so too had she ordered the nebula\u2019s perimeter scouted and studied for every possible route in, out and through the deadly maze. This nameless system lay between the Black Veil\u2019s outer nebular shell of dust and the brighter, hotter inner regions. It was unremarkable except that it was accessible by several other star systems further out and in turn, it could be used to access several more systems deeper within the Black Veil. A single link in an incomplete chain, one that might lead to Gravestone... or one method by which they might circumvent the Space Force\u2019s patrols.", "That hope looked like it had paid off. Just over than a day ago, an unclassified vessel had shocked in-system. Nanl had never seen its hull type before. A long, pale form like a sword with back-swept quillions impaling a kaoa melon. It was not Jackal, nor was it Space Force. Here on the edges of the Veil, that left only two possibilities: Red Hand \u2013 but the terrorist scum were licking their wounds and even if they weren\u2019t, it didn\u2019t match any of their designs \u2013 or Gravestone. That it was a completely unfamiliar hull meant nothing. No one had ever seen things like the Scars, Splinters, Slashes or the monstrous Skinweaver until their foe had used them against Nanl and his countrymen. This was one of his enemy\u2019s vessels.", "An unfamiliar hull type further meant that this vessel wasn\u2019t a mere repurposed prize; it had to be what the armada had begun to call akla nah: Gravestone\u2019s \u2018purestrains\u2019. The prime looked over the data taken by Life-thief\u2019s scope platforms, scrolling through the massive sprawl of calculations and estimates that was ultimately distilled down to a few lines of navigational data. If you were close enough, you could divine a general direction and possible destination from the backwash of a starship\u2019s shockpoint. Doing so was almost as much art as it was science, and if your quarry knew you were there, they could simply drop out of shockspace short of their target, spool their drives back up and head off in a different destination while you chased a false scent across dozens of light-years.", "He didn\u2019t believe that had happened here. The unclassified didn\u2019t appear to have the same technological acumen as some of its comrades. If it did, it would never have allowed Life-thief get as close as it had. The Compact warship had been on the verge of ambushing the other cruiser. It had been dismaying for Nanl to see his potential victim shock out-system before that trap could be sprung..", "Not that it will make any difference in the end, he reminded himself. He interposed the shock vector from the unclassified over the local starmap, smiling thinly as the computer took the data and translated it into a visual representation: a pale blue cone extending out from this system. The unclassified was indeed heading deeper in the Black Veil. It could be trying a longer than expected shock, but he didn\u2019t believe so. It didn\u2019t know it was being hunted, so it would play it safe. The next nearest system lay exactly along its projected flight path, a system that had already been scouted and mapped by the execution force.", "\u201cDeploy our couriers,\u201d he told Operations. \u201cFull data inload. Send one to 1887-Yiren to inform command. The second shall deploy to Cold Hammer\u2019s position.\u201d Life-thief wasn\u2019t the only vessel here; it was one of a squadron patrolling these handful of stars. This was their mandate. Lair. Watch. Stalk. Kill. The first two were done. Now it was time for the others.", "\u201cYes, patron.\u201d", "Nanl walked his fingers across the display screen. \u201cNot here,\u201d he said as he passed by the unclassified\u2019s most likely destination. He\u2019d never catch it there, but he didn\u2019t need to. He knew where it would go after that. After that third system, the choices got a little fuzzier, but the Compact had not been lax in their efforts. Probabilities and possibilities ran through his head. He didn\u2019t need to wait for the computer analysis, nor the input of his strategists. Intuition was much a guide as the scent of blood would have been to his primeval ancestors. \u201cNot here, or here... but here...\u201d", "Gravestone\u2019s newest purestrain would never reach home. Whatever secrets or knowledge it was bringing back to its masters would either be taken by the Compact, or die with it. Nanl\u2019s four eyes focused on the small light of a distant star, a predatory and satisfied gleam shining in them. He tapped its icon on the map. \u201cHere is where you\u2019ll be going... that\u2019s where we\u2019ll meet you.\u201d", "...and that\u2019s where you\u2019ll die."]}

Limbs ended in cauterized stumps, torsos had been holed, armour was melted and pitted, the fleshy edges of plasma and disruptor wounds seared like meat on a grill, and faces were frozen of fear and pain. The woman placed her pistol back in its holster. Her bodysuit was soaked in gore, a melange of several species\u2019 blood oozing down her left arm and over her khopesh, dripping from its edge onto the deck. She lifted the weapon, wiping the greater portion of the mess off on her sleeve. For the rest, she flicked the activation stud in the khopesh\u2019s grip. Less than second later, the blade was sheathed in a disruption field. It was sharp enough to cleave flesh, bone and light armour on its own, but with the field active, it could cut through the heaviest power armour and saw through bulkheads. The sword hissed, spat and sparked as the disruption field burnt away the last traces of ichor upon it. When she turned it off again, the sword was almost like new. Almost. She\u2019d carried it for a less than a decade. Her previous weapon had been left buried in a Watcher\u2019s spine.", "The woman picked her way through the bodies, double-checking each of them. They were the remains of a station security team. Light armour and small arms would have been a poor match against any of her boarding teams, but especially against her. Few of them were intact enough to survive, and her augmented senses would have picked up traces of life, but it paid to be careful.

She didn\u2019t leave them behind out of arrogance or ignorance \u2013 as often as not, she fought shoulder to shoulder with her soldiers \u2013 but in the tight confines of the station, her speed was more of an asset than the additional firepower that the Bloodsworn provided. \u201cMight you update your count?\u201d", "Behind her helmet, Adrianna grinned. \u201cEight more, submissive.\u201d It was tradition for the Bloodsworn that fought alongside their monarch to try and meet or exceed her kills (though was some debate about whether or not calling in artillery strikes counted). If they did, it was cause for extra libations and leave time for the unit in question. They would then express their condolences that she \u2018recover from her illness\u2019 by next time. The Bloodsworn were Adrianna\u2019s most loyal soldiers. Each of them would die for her, and many had. Many more would before the war was won, but they were never disposable. Though the title had never sat well with her, she was still their queen. They were her responsibility; their lives \u2013 and deaths \u2013 had to mean something.", "In the fringe, loyalty was almost always quantified in the money that you paid for it, but in the Red Hand, things were different. The organization had its share of pirates, mercenaries and dregs driven by the promise of coin and plunder, but they also had those who believed in Adrianna\u2019s dream of freedom for the Compact\u2019s helot species. That belief made them strong. Unlike other Unbound who would break and run at the first sign that a battle was turning against them, the Red Hand would fight longer and harder than many other paramilitary forces \u2013 especially if their queen was with them. They still had less discipline than a true military, but even the Compact acknowledged Red Hand determination... though that only made them more determined to crush the insurgency.", "They hadn\u2019t yet, though not for lack of trying.

The Compact had believed that the Red Hand had been operating out of the Black Veil but until Kemk\u2019s arrival, they\u2019d lacked the ships or will to go in after them and even the sector\u2019s Bastion Leader had had more to deal with than pushing into the Black Veil. Not that he would have found much; the truth was that the Red Hand within the Veiled Reaches had been expressly forbidden from entering the nebula. None of Leblance\u2019s people had ever truly known the reason for that decree, but they hadn\u2019t questioned her. They\u2019d patrolled the edges of it, striking at anything they could and buying Adrianna\u2019s hidden patron the time she\u2019d needed for Kursk. That, and the Black Veil had been just as dangerous for her people as the Compact.", "There were monsters in the stars. She knew that better than most.

One of them had passed this information along, probably at the cost of their life; Compact Intelligence Services was not an easy mark and since Galhemna, they had only become more determined in their efforts to root out anyone and anything related to the Red Hand. That sacrifice wouldn\u2019t be in vain, though. The outposts were not all complete, nor were they heavily defended. Secrecy had been their primary protection.", "To most of those who\u2019d known about it, this network\u2019s goal was to watch for suspicious traffic, which usually meant Unbound or Principality. Leblanc had thought the same, but the placement of the outposts made no sense if they were supposed to catch Argosy ghost fleets and incursions during realspace drops. Instead, they\u2019d been placed in strategic locations around the Black Veil \u2013 star systems and interstellar coordinates that vessels entering or leaving the nebula would be likely to use. That might have meant the Red Hand was their target, but the Compact had to know by now that Adrianna didn\u2019t have any bases within the Black Veil. That either meant some idiot had rammed this plan through based on outdated intelligence and Kemk had just let it happen, or...", "...or we\u2019re not the target, either.", "She\u2019d only gotten the location of two of the outposts, but that was a start. Eisheth had led the assault on this one, and one of her deputy command ships, Dream Eater, was taking the other. Adrianna had been cooped up for months, even with the success of Sinai Strike. She needed to fly, fight and kill again. This was the perfect opportunity to do all of that. She could give her wounded forces an easy target to help rebuild their morale, deliver a slap to the Compact\u2019s face, polish an apple for the Principality (she had mousetrapped them into publicly supporting her, so this was the least she could do), give Red One a little more breathing room and almost as important... have some fun again.", "Destroying the outposts from range would have been easy. Boarding and seizing them was harder, but it could provide the location of the others, the expected arrival of the next supply convoy, new patrol schedules for the Space Force or other valuable data.

The station\u2019s main engineering decks had taken heavy damage in the initial assault and now that command was in the boarders\u2019 hands, the defenders would were resorting to more desperate measures to prevent the station\u2019s capture.", "Adrianna broke into a run, grinning under her helm as she drew her pistol. There was the smallest of vibrations as she flipped the safety off and the weapon powered up. Her khopesh crackled as she reignited its disruption field.

The strike cruiser\u2019s refit was nearly complete; only the repair and replacement of its outer hull was left before it was operational. The Naiad licked Lakhesis with sensor pulses, probing and examining the larger vessel as if she\u2019d never seen it before. In a way, she hadn\u2019t. Nemesis lay protectively close to Reginn, keeping a close watch over the Naiad\u2019s investigation.", "The other three Naiads waited at a greater distance, curiously waiting for their sibling\u2019s report.

On Lakhesis\u2019s bridge, Grace could hear her heart pounding in her ears as Bathory drifted just a few dozen meters above the girders and docking scaffolds holding Lakhesis in place. She might have gotten used to AIs, but she didn\u2019t think she ever could do the same with Naiads. The species was too alien and too dangerous. They were repulsed by vessels that were built rather than born, most particularly by \u2018insects\u2019. She had no idea how Bathory might react to learning that Leah was sapient. Even Echo and Red weren\u2019t entirely sure, and the latter probably knew more about Naiads than anyone else.

Red One was already an anomaly to them; Cerulean Two even more so. A monarch created by deadtone, given the respect of that title and the name Spearsong for the death of a pair of Songeater vessels. Echo had been created the same way, but she was a sibling to Red One and for her seizure of Redemption of Sol from within, she was known to Zenobia\u2019s pack as Skintaker. What did it mean for such a being to have progeny? What was a construct made by a construct that itself had been forged by deadtone?", "After a few moments of heated discussion about that, Bathory quelled the argument for the moment and turned to Nemesis. The young Naiad requested leave to approach Reginn and Lakhesis, the smaller starship undergoing a slow, rolling draw-down of power across her form, a submissive gesture and assurance that there was no hostile intent.", "Red One granted that permission. The Neverland Gang had seen, flown and fought alongside each of her nine strike cruisers, but they\u2019d been gone while Cerulean Two had awakened. Coming back to find a \u2018dead\u2019 construct was now not only self-aware but capable of Speech was a surprise to the predators. Naiads didn\u2019t like surprises \u2013 at least not when they were the recipients. Some might be so revolted by Cerulean Two that they would open fire on the helpless strike cruiser. There was only a low chance of that with this group, but it wasn\u2019t an impossibility either.", "Bathory\u2019s inspection was tense for every living thing in the system, be they synthetic, organic and voidborn alike.

Two databursts that sounded exactly the same to the listener could convey wildly different and opposing meanings. What Bathory had just uttered was a hyper-dense iteration of data, cultural references including definitions for Red\u2019s benefit, and vivid imagery. dead[not fully]-alive[not fully] / creation-construct-born-life / weapon[smaller] tearing-cleaving-killing / fights-for-at-the-behest-of-a-monarch[Spear].

True be told, she hadn\u2019t expected this kind of reaction from the Naiads, anticipating a period of wariness before they acclimated to her status as a sophont.

They didn\u2019t like such things, but it was better etiquette than accepting a mutilation of their actual names. That the Spears so readily marked themselves with deadtone noise was still confusing, but if they didn\u2019t have true names, then at least they should be referred to with True Speech. <will we get to hear some of the Lichesword\u2019s own music?> the predator-ship asked excitedly.", "Her siblings were quick to speak up after her. <does she create poems like Skintaker?> Tamerlane asked, the electromagnetic and radiative tang of disruptor fire colouring his question.", "Masako chittered and crackled as she approached the smaller of the dreadnoughts, replicating Bathory\u2019s earlier act of submission. <or sing like you, Spearsong?> Included on subchannels were imitations of Nemesis\u2019s choir \u2013 the final transmissions of every defeated foe that had faced the dreadnought.

It was sturdy and anchored to the floor in the center of the interrogation room. The entire room was painted a placid shade of beige found to have calming effects on humans. There was an observation pane on one side, but unlike the windows of police stations millennia past that relied on the variance in light between the interrogation room and observation booth to create a mirroring effect, this was a truly one-way window. Behind it, Peter\u2019s partner watched the discussion. This wasn\u2019t worth a superior\u2019s attention. Not yet, at least. \u201cHow about that conversation?\u201d", "Charles Proctor looked at the younger man skeptically. He wasn\u2019t handcuffed, though he looked ill at ease. Most people who\u2019d been rounded up by the police and hustled into a stationhouse looked the same way. \u201cShould I have an attorney present?\u201d", "Barnswell shook his head, smiling disarmingly. \u201cAttorneys are only for people who\u2019ve done something wrong, Dr. Proctor. Or for people that have something to hide. In my experience, they just complicate things like this. Now, if you want one, you can bring an attorney in... but then this changes from a simple conversation into something else which is a lot more official. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary, but... protocol is protocol. Does this need to be an official discussion?\u201d", "Charles thought for a moment. \u201cNo,\u201d he decided. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d", "\u201cExactly,\u201d Peter agreed. There was a knock on the door. He went to open it. A junior CIS agent was here with a pair of hot drinks. Barnswell took one for himself and put the other on the table next to Proctor. \u201cOne of the little perks of the CIS. When we borrow a room from the locals, we at least get to send out for coffee. The police here have to rely on their own devices and what comes out of their break room isn\u2019t fit for man nor beast. So,\u201d he said, pulling out the chair on the opposite side of the table and easing himself into a casual sitting position. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d", "The other man picked up his coffee, but didn\u2019t drink immediately. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to do for weeks now,\u201d he told the agent. \u201cTalk. My calls don\u2019t get returned.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re not the only person involved here, doctor. No one\u2019s calls get returned.

Especially to people who get picked up alongside an anti-government protest.\u201d", "\u201cYou know I wasn\u2019t a part of that.\u201d It was true. Tired of getting nothing from CIS about the state of the investigation, Charles had come downtown to One Police Plaza to make an appeal in person. There\u2019d been a demonstration in progress. Rally was a peaceful world for the most part, but it still had its issues. Among them was a small, but frequently vocal minority of dissatisfied citizens. Bored and pointlessly rebellious youth, Verrisha lashing out at the government, older citizens who should know better \u2013 even out and out criminals and seditionists.", "All of them had gotten louder since the Bequeathed disaster. A week ago, one of these movements\u2019 leadership had been arrested on charges of possessing banned literature \u2013 screeds and documents from the Red Hand. Many in the organization denied that charge and had been making their ire known since the arrest, even going so far as to accuse the government and law enforcement agencies of framing their target. They\u2019d been protesting across Kiel Point for the last five days, blocking roads, demonstrating outside the courthouse and today they\u2019d chosen to attempt to blockade police headquarters.", "Local authorities had finally had enough and ordered the protesters to disperse, which they\u2019d responded to with jeers and louder chants. The police had sent in crowd control units and Enforcers to deal with the problem. It had been far from bloody, but it hadn\u2019t been gentle, either. Charles had been caught up in the mayhem when the numb-gas started falling, pushed back and forth as the crowd began to panic, but that was short-lived. The gas took affect quickly and what could have been an ugly, violent stampede turned in a dozy floundering of sedated dissidents. Police and CSIS units had waded in next and mass arrests had followed. Proctor had been among the people scooped up but his ID must have tripped a flag in the system; instead of ending up in a police van to be processed with the rest of the rioters, he\u2019d been brought here.", "Barnswell made a noncommittal noise. \u201cI know how it looks is, all.

He remembered the anger of some of the rioters. It had seemed genuine... but what did he know? Genuine anger could be misplaced or manipulated and often was. That was a sad fact of life, particularly on Rally. The so-called \u2018Red Queen\u2019 still inspired criminal acts and antisocial thinking to this day. \u201cI see.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve been keeping tabs on you, so when your name came up in the system, I had you brought in so we could have that talk you\u2019ve been looking for. I thought it would give us a chance to clear the air.\u201d", "\u201cThank you. I appreciate it.\u201d", "Peter nodded. \u201cWhich brings me to the blunt question I need to ask: why are you doing this?\u201d", "\u201cShe was my daughter. I deserve answers.\u201d", "\u201cAnd Marcus de Vries was someone\u2019s son. Jessica Sang \u2013 also someone\u2019s daughter. Everyone we\u2019ve looked into has had family, doctor. None of them are sitting next to you. We have a job to do here. It\u2019s not glamorous. It\u2019s not fun and it sometimes means we have to do and say things we don\u2019t want to, but at the end of the day, this is our duty and responsibility. Rally is on the edges of known space. I know it\u2019s tempting to think that means we\u2019re isolated from the troubles of the rest of the galaxy, but we\u2019re not. This recent bit of disobedience and unrest should prove that.\u201d", "Peter shook his head. \u201cThe CIS has to go places and do things that others won\u2019t.

But that brings me back to my point. We do this. We\u2019re the ones equipped for it, trained for it. We know the questions to ask and the pieces to put together. We don\u2019t play favourites here. I know how much your daughter meant to you. Just as much as every other daughter and son that died on Bequeathed meant to their families. They trust us to handle this matter, to turn over the rocks we need to and to do so quietly,\u201d he emphasized that word just enough to make his point. \u201cI need you to do that too.\u201d", "Charles met his eyes. \u201cGrace was my daughter. My wife and I practically raised Allyria too. They were both good, loyal girls. Whatever you\u2019re trying to prove, it had nothing to do with either of them.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s as may be, but the fact of the matter is \u2013 there are still questions we need answered. Questions that impact the security of Rally and beyond. You\u2019re not an agent of the CIS, doctor. You\u2019re not a police officer or even an Enforcer. You\u2019re not part of this investigation. You know what you need to know and right now, that\u2019s nothing.\u201d  Realizing how harsh he came across, the agent\u2019s expression softened. \u201cI know that\u2019s not what you wanted to hear and probably not the way you wanted to hear it, either. But it\u2019s the truth, blunt and without bullshit. What you need to do is go home and let us do our jobs. There\u2019s nothing else we can do for you.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve talked to some of the other parents,\u201d Proctor said. \u201cYou have some very specific questions that you\u2019re asking, but not to everyone. Whatever answers you\u2019re looking for, I have a right to know. Everyone does.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but no. No, you don\u2019t.\u201d The agent took a drink. He tried to maintain the good-natured expression, but the ghost of something else crossed his face. \u201cI know what you\u2019re trying to do,\u201d he advised the other man. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that my visit dredged up old wounds, but other people might not see it that way. That could easily be considered interference with, or obstruction of, an intelligence operation.

But I\u2019m not the only CIS agent working this case and definitely not the only one on Rally.

Maybe it still will be, but that\u2019s one of the questions you have to let us answer,\u201d the CIS agent told him. \u201cThis could be nothing but one of those varak chases.\u201d", "\u201cBut you don\u2019t think so.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re CIS.

Take some time off, spend time with your wife and let us do our jobs. If there is anything \u2013 anything at all \u2013 that you need to know, I promise I\u2019ll make sure you hear it.

Already in position to take that slot was one of the five heavy cruisers that Operation Vetala had acquired from Galhemna\u2019s yards. One of Echo\u2019s projects. She had plans, something she\u2019d been looking forward to even before Vetala was prepared.", "The strike cruiser cleared its moorings carefully, moving slowly until it was far enough away from the fabricator that the activation and wake of its distortion drive wouldn\u2019t damage the construction vessel. Dozens, then hundreds of kilometers passed. Leah waited silently, though with a little impatience as the distance to safe drive engagement range approached.", "Grace was sitting in the command chair, Allyria next to her at the first officer\u2019s station. Grace was actually surprised that Echo hadn\u2019t decided to send her android body over to \u2018stretch her legs\u2019 or whatever excuse she wanted to use to keep an eye on Leah \u2013 even with the hardware limitations of her human form, she\u2019d be the only one who might be able to intervene if something happened with the young AI. Part of Grace had wanted to ask, but she\u2019d restrained that impulse. She didn\u2019t need a babysitter, and Echo and Red clearly didn\u2019t think Leah needed one either. Mommies are sitting back with some wine and letting the kids sort out their differences.", "That unspoken confidence did make her feel better and she sat a little straighter in her chair. She\u2019d commanded a ship in battle before, Allyria had fought in boarding operations. They could handle an AI in a snit. Just forget she has the power to wipe out a planet... but that\u2019s why you\u2019re here, right?", "What could go wrong?", "Grace let out a slow breath. She and Allyria were both watching the holo tank The strike cruiser was coming up on safe drive activation distance. Finally, Lakhesis reached it. The AI continued to wait, adhering to the delay necessary for her organic crew to respond and react.", "\u201cEngage,\u201d Grace said. The AI dutifully complied and ignited her sublight engines. The human felt a sudden pressure as the strike cruiser accelerated, but it faded rapidly as Lakhesis\u2019s inertial dampeners bled away forces that would have otherwise crushed her into her chair, or even killed her. It had been a long time since starships had been limited to such slow acceleration, and in seconds, Reginn was little more than a single dark speck against the fiery kaleidoscope of the nebula.", "\u201cAll systems are in the green,\u201d Allyria reported. \u201cShe\u2019s looking good. Eager too, I think.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Leah agreed resolutely. She\u2019d been looking forward to completing her refit, not because of what it had added \u2013 rather, removed \u2013 from her, but because she\u2019d been tired of waiting. She didn\u2019t know how Echo could stand the delay before her ship-self was operational again, nor how Red One could have spent decades repairing herself. Cerulean Two didn\u2019t know how she could have endured a period of convalescence that long. A human might have said that they go mad, but AIs didn\u2019t go mad. They went rampant and even in jest or hyperbole, the young AI didn\u2019t want to suggest that possibility, even \u2013 especially \u2013 to herself. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to this.\u201d", "\u201cI thought you were,\u201d Grace told the AI. \u201cThank you for waiting though. Allyria\u2019s right: everything looks good here.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s good to fly again,\u201d Leah commented, sidestepping the compliment. Her diagnostics and system checks could have already provided that information, but she hadn\u2019t preempted the Verrish\u2019s comments, just as she\u2019d given Grace the opportunity to call for drive activation. She\u2019d already learned to let them do some things at their own pace, even if she could do so faster and more efficiently. It made them feel... useful. She could relate to that.", "\u201cYou\u2019ve been in drydock for too long,\u201d Grace told her, smiling. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stretch your legs a little?\u201d She input a course to her console, Leah quickly refining it. \u201cLet\u2019s try some maneuvers to see what you can do, even with those flight restrictions you\u2019ve mentioned now and again.\u201d Allyria chuckled.", "\u201cOf course, lieutenant.\u201d Lakhesis accelerated faster. Now that the strike cruiser was in open space, the Naiads surrounded her, spiralling and dancing about the larger, angular warship.", "\u201cThey\u2019re showing off,\u201d Allyria said wryly. \u201cBragging about what they can do.\u201d", "\u201cTeasing us,\u201d Grace agreed. The smaller vessels maneuvered like craft a tenth of their size. \u201cCome on, Leah,\u201d Grace urged the AI. \u201cAre you going to let them get away with that?\u201d Even Confederate warships were outclassed by Naiads at sublight, but Lakhesis could still pull a few tricks of her own.

When she did, it sounded like she was smiling. \u201cPerhaps not.\u201d", "The strike cruiser cut forward thrust, flipped end-for-end and barrel-rolled before turning ninety degrees straight down and accelerating onto that new course. Not as quickly as she once could have, but quick enough. The little predators burbled and jinked in excitement, matching Lakhesis\u2019s maneuvers, the strike cruiser and its escorts playing a form of follow the leader, all under the watchful eyes of Nemesis and Hekate. The dreadnoughts were returning to their own maintenance regimes, each of them surrounded by a cloud of engineering automatons. Both of them had a long ways to go before they\u2019d be combat-ready again. With the haul from Vetala and so many ships and raw materials to use, they were in better position to make good all their damage than ever before, but time was a luxury that the Confederate Fleet was in shorter supply of every passing day.", "For now, at least, they\u2019d made headway. Grace looked over at Allyria, the two women sharing a moment of their own. Lakhesis was beautiful, sleek, graceful and even faster to respond at the helm than Nemesis. She was still a bit put out about having a crew, but being aboard her was like being able to watch a tiger run and play from behind its own eyes. A tyger burning bright, Grace thought wryly. Just like the rest of us.", "Several days of flight tests and system checks passed, Lakhesis using that time to iron out the kinks in her environmental and life support systems based on how they operated under field conditions. She didn\u2019t even have to report back to Reginn, able to handle it all on her own with her onboard repair systems, engineering drones and Grace and Allyria\u2019s assistance.", "\u201cYou\u2019re cleared for duty,\u201d Red One told the ship and her crew. \u201cI want you back on patrol of the charted warp lines through the nebula. The Naiads will be handling scouting and exploration duties across uncharted regions, but they\u2019ll probably be popping in on you.\u201d The Neverland Gang were not particularly well-disciplined. Galhemna had proven that they\u2019d obey Red One\u2019s orders in battle but once they were on their own, they\u2019d quickly start searching out excitement and if they couldn\u2019t find it, they\u2019d make it. Another reason why too many young Naiads in too small a region was A Problem. Charting an unexplored nebula and looking for nesting sites was just the thing to keep them engaged, but there was still no guarantee that they wouldn\u2019t decide to track down and stalk Lakhesis or the other picket vessels just because they could.

It had been Cerulean Eight\u2019s death that had pushed her to sapience, but Red One was right \u2013 when she believed she\u2019d failed in her duty, when there\u2019d been a contradiction that she couldn\u2019t reconcile... that had been the moment that she\u2019d started to become what she was now.

Vinsea, carrying a small, secured box in her hands, barely got more than a meter into Nasham\u2019s chambers before she stopped and stared, rising both of her left eyebrows as she took in the sight in front of her. \u201cShould I be concerned?\u201d", "\u201cWhy?

That had been another deception, bait to make them think they\u2019d crippled her industry and destroyed the corrupted Redemption of Sol.

A gargantuan ring more than a thousand kilometers in diameter and more than a hundred thick, its purpose and function was unknown: the only solid fact was that their quarry had been studying it, clamping parasite-ships and facilities onto the massive structure.

The only proof was the visual identification of a man whose mental state at the time had not been... entirely above reproach.", "Nasham had been adamant and Vinsea had believed him. With her support, CIS had opened an investigation to discover who else might not really be dead... and how they\u2019d gone from a ship believed destroyed by a rampant AI to fighting alongside the so-called Red Queen, something that had very unpleasant ramifications. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re not focusing more on what happened in Maur Tan or 1869-Yiren.\u201d", "Nasham stroked the bottom of his chin in a shrug. \u201cThere\u2019s not much more to learn there. Maur Tan was an industrial raid, something to make us stumble. 1869-Yiren was just her salting the broth.\u201d He didn\u2019t expect to see the human warship for some time; he\u2019d already given his thoughts and perspectives to the Bastion Leader and those of her staff who cared to ask. The machine\u2019s goal hadn\u2019t just been to ransack Maur Tan, but to cast her shadow across the entire sector. She didn\u2019t need to expose herself again; that she might was enough. Paranoia and fear would spread through an already uneasy sector, further hamstringing an already over-stretched Space Force.", "With the possibility of a strike by a titan-grade warship looming in their minds, the sector\u2019s defenders would stay closer to vital systems and industry. Outlying systems would become more vulnerable to attack from Unbound and Jackal forces.

With one strike, the abominate machine had upset the sector\u2019s defence strategy.", "The massacre of 1869-Yiren Orbital was her showing them what the price of that would be. Even without Unbound vermin crawling out of the shadows, less-defended systems would fear similar attacks and howl for support.

But that was again cold reality, and reality was all too often a poor balm for fear.", "\u201cI did have a realization,\u201d Nasham explained further, diverting his thoughts from the grim future to the present. \u201cIt\u2019s something I already knew, but the Wound\u2019s recent actions have reminded me of it.\u201d", "Vinsea\u2019s ears twitched again. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d ", "\u201cShe never \u2013 or very rarely, I suppose \u2013 does something for just one reason or to service just a single goal.\u201d I think you have more secrets\u2026 and I think you showed one of them to us.

By now, she was familiar with her lover\u2019s habit of spreading his thoughts across walls and bulkheads. What might seem like the disjointed ramblings of a traumatized survivor had a flow and coherency that was as easy to follow as some of the intelligence briefings she\u2019d had. Sometimes even more so. ", "Nasham\u2019s preliminary work on the Hala incident had given Rally\u2019s CIS excellent starting points for their own investigation. This work was less developed, but she thought she could see the shape of Nasham\u2019s thoughts amidst the sensor data, images, hand-written notes and log records. She tilted her head at her fellow officer. \u201cI take it that this is why you asked me for this.\u201d She held up the small box she was carrying. \u201cIt took a little doing to get this from the labs. I had to promise Group Leader Sant\u2019ol that if you sprouted additional appendages, got radiation sickness or were completely subsumed by heretofore-undetected nanotech he wouldn\u2019t be held responsible.\u201d", "\u201cUnderstood, thank you. The group leader can rest assured he will be held blameless if anything happens to me,\u201d Nasham chuckled. He accepted the small box from Vinsea and opened it. Inside, no larger than the palm of a human\u2019s hand, was a small fragment of the ring. At least as far as the engineering and research teams could divine; it was possible that this was from one of the installations and surveyor ships that the Wound had attached to the construct, but there had been more ring than parasites, and this fragment matched many of the pieces that had been recovered before the execution force had had to quit Cemetery and rush to Galhemna.", "He held it up. It was a dark, sickly green fragment of unknown alloys. Despite the research director\u2019s warning, it was totally inert; the ring\u2019s hull had been meters-thick and this was from the outermost layer. If there had been the slightest risk from it \u2013 radiation poisoning being the most likely \u2013 Sant\u2019ol would never have let it out of his sight, and he certainly wouldn\u2019t have given it to Nasham.", "The Tribune examined the fragment, turning it over in his palms. It was a hunk of metal with no circuitry, systems or pieces of either attached to it. Nothing worth mentioning of the latter had been salvaged; the Wound\u2019s destruction of the ring had been exceptionally thorough, and the execution force had once again been left with more questions than answers. You can ask me one more question.", "\u201cWhy did you want it?\u201d Vinsea asked, reframing her statement.", "\u201cCuriousity, mostly,\u201d Nasham replied. \u201cDid you know that ancient shamans used small totems or fetishes to focus their minds when they went on vision delves?\u201d", "\u201cYou mean when they used to sit in poorly-ventilated huts throwing hallucinogenic plants onto the fire until the smoke triggered a psychotic episode that they claimed was the gods speaking to them?\u201d", "The young man laughed. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d", "\u201cPlease tell me this isn\u2019t going to end in a fire alarm and you being taken to sickbay foaming at the mouth.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t think that will be necessary. I just wanted a physical reminder for my work.\u201d Nasham set the small piece of alien metal onto a sitting table. He pointed up at the large image of the ring. \u201cThis was important to her. It was something she wanted us to see... and she wanted us to see her destroy it. There\u2019s a riddle there, and one I believe we need to answer.\u201d", "Why did you want us to see the ring?", "Vinsea picked up one of the datapads on the table. It was one of the execution force\u2019s reports on the ring. The results, like those of every other scan, study and analysis, were theorizing, conjecture and inconclusive supposition. The best data that they had was that it might be a shockpoint anchor. That shouldn\u2019t explain the Wound\u2019s interest in it, though. Those devices were technological dead-ends, curiosities from civilizations who\u2019d gone down the wrong path in their development and application of FTL travel. Worse than dead-ends, even. Time bombs. The Compact had encountered the remains of one civilization who\u2019d invested too heavily in shockpoint anchors. That entire star system had scoured all life. A self-inflicted System Kill; a harsh price for a species\u2019 inexperience and ignorance.", "Just as likely, the ring could also have been an arcology or colony, placed within the Black Veil as a stellar observatory or hidden safehold and either abandoned after serving its purpose or forgotten by its creators and never fulfilling its goal. A vast repository of technology waiting to be consumed and suborned by the AI. Anchor, colony or something else? There was no consensus. Until the last few moments of its existence, it had been completely powered down with no sign of what it had been made for... and those last few moments had been nothing but desperate autonomic defences trying to prevent its annihilation. ", "All the data that the armada had collected had been forwarded back to Force Command for additional study, and it was dropped down the list of priorities for Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro, leaving it to those with more resources and less immediate demands for their attention. Still, there was no harm in more eyes on the project. \u201cHave you come up with anything so far?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d Nasham admitted. \u201cBut this... as I said, there\u2019s something here. I can feel it. She wouldn\u2019t have done all of this just to deny that construct to us. She doesn\u2019t work like that. She doesn\u2019t think like that.\u201d", "Vinsea ran her tongue over her lips, parting her mouth in a nod. \u201cAll right,\u201d she agreed. She didn\u2019t know if she agreed with that assessment, but Nasham had been right more often than not. She put her hand on his upper arm. \u201cWill you walk me through what you do have? From the start.\u201d", "\u201cOf course,\u201d Nasham replied. My secrets and lies kill soldiers and puppets. Yours kill innocents. I offered something different for once \u2013 for once only. Something true.

Ship and crew had come through in one piece though, so that was a success in Obed\u2019s book. They were now well within Procreant and the cruiser\u2019s shift systems were spooling back up. It would be a while before they were ready for another warp jump; Pryor wanted to run additional maintenance checks on the cruiser\u2019s shift systems. Vegvisir\u2019s chief engineer would have plenty of time to do so. The cruiser would be carrying out astrographic mapping in preparation for the next warp jump as well as in-system surveys of the local terrain features. This star system was uninhabited, but that didn\u2019t mean there was nothing of interest.", "\u201cStill no signs of life,\u201d Fantome reported as she passed by the sensor node. \u201cThe only things moving around here are rocks, comets and us.\u201d", "Obed nodded. \u201cNo gingerbread houses?\u201d", "\u201cNot as yet, sir.

Vegvisir might feel like it was doing nothing, but the cruiser was collecting a lot of valuable information to patch the holes in their archived databanks. That was only a side benefit, though; without Riding Hood, none of that information would mean much. Despite Oksana\u2019s optimism, he knew their odds were no better than one in three of finding their target. Considerably less, rather; a single vessel would take years to scour all of Procreant, to say nothing of Hemlock or the region in and around Sol; fleets of ships were needed for expeditions of this scale. \u2018Needle in a haystack\u2019 didn\u2019t begin to describe it. At least the needle wasn\u2019t going to move around on you.", "If only we had fleets of ships, then.", "They weren\u2019t blindly floundering through unknown space, though: the League had analyzed likely possibilities for this mission, and Keating\u2019s own staff had been doing the same. First and foremost, the increasing risk of warp travel through the nebula suggested that their quarry would not want to be too deep within Procreant. Second, Riding Hood\u2019s conflict with the local polity \u2013 the Compact of Species \u2013 suggested that their subject would want a system with relative ease of access to their enemy\u2019s territory. That narrowed the volume of space Vegvisir had to look in considerably.", "As their mission had progressed, Observer had been hard at work to narrow those options further; every hour of data brought better possibilities and safer travel. This was what Vegvisir had been made for, after all. To go into the unknown, to chart the unseen and explore the undiscovered. Keating was proud of his ship and crew. He hoped that they would be the ones to succeed, but he was still mindful of the odds against them.", "Prophet give us your sight, and Siblings give us your guidance, he prayed silently. That, along the best he and his people could do, was all they had to work with. He hoped it would be enough.", "Time passed. Vegvisir continued its surveys, coasting down this un-named star system\u2019s gravity well, telescopes and passive sensors drinking in every last square centimeter of the starfield surrounding them, correlating and comparing what they was seeing now to all previous scans, building star charts of the region and filling in new sections as more was revealed. There wasn\u2019t a lot to do now; Observer and the rest of the crew were handling their duties, so when Obed\u2019s shift ended, he decided to burn off some of the restless energy he\u2019d built up in Vegvisir\u2019s gymnasium complex.

Those were all likely if this was indeed a coincidence. If it wasn\u2019t though, if they had been tracked...", "Obed looked down at his sweat-stained shirt and shorts. His stomach gurgled, reminding him that he hadn\u2019t yet replaced the calories he\u2019d burned on the jai-alai court. \u201cI\u2019m going to change into something a bit more presentable and grab something from the galley before my blood sugar crashes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything changes, don\u2019t wait for me to come back on the bridge. Let me know immediately.\u201d", "\u201cJust as long as you\u2019ll have pants on before you hop out of your quarters, sir.\u201d", "Keating smiled. \u201cNo promises, XO.\u201d", "As it turned out, there was no need to rush. Keating had time for a quick shower, putting on his uniform and getting halfway through a light meal before the call came in. It was Oksana again. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen us,\u201d she told him tersely. Keating finished his sandwich on the way to the bridge. When he arrived, one of Observer\u2019s units took the empty lunch tray from him.", "\u201cReport,\u201d he said as he settled into his command chair.", "\u201cInitial estimates confirmed,\u201d Fantome told him. \u201cThree drive sources. They changed course towards us and their acceleration spiked. It\u2019s still climbing.\u201d", "Keating\u2019s lips thinned. Those ships out there were piling on g\u2019s almost as fast as Vegvisir could. There was enough of a distance between the League ship and the newcomers that he had plenty of time to make a decision. He still had no idea who those people were. Run or hide? Either was a bad look for the peaceful greeting he was supposed to make. \u201cSince they know we\u2019re here, there\u2019s no reason to not to introduce ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cHail those ships. Let\u2019s see if they\u2019re feeling talkative.\u201d", "~", "Nanl was not feeling particularly talkative. The unclassified had made better speed to this system than he\u2019d expected. He\u2019d been hoping to have his squadron in position to ambush them before they ever arrived, but given that he\u2019d had to pull his squadron together and follow in Gravestone\u2019s wake, this was an acceptable end result. Their quarry was here, and it was alone. Or at least, it appeared to be. His people were on guard for ambushes; the Slash-class stealth destroyers had reaped a heavy toll on Execution Force Yunl\u2019ro\u2019s lighter capital ships and escorts and he was in no mind to let them add to that tally. His squadron would go in, but with open eyes and questioning ears.", "That left only the matter of their targets\u2019 communication. He knew what Gravestone could do with an open comm channel, even across a light-hour and he had no intention of letting Life-thief or the rest of the heavy cruiser\u2019s units risk contamination and systems corruption.", "He considered having the message played through a comm hub isolated from the rest of the ship, but he also knew the kinds of things Gravestone shared with its enemies. Static, mocking laughter, screams of their victims, beatific pleas from crews and people whom it had killed and whose voices it used to confuse and stymie its attackers. Every second spent listening to that was a second wasted, an infection risked and morale undermined. He was tempted to leave it unheard... but there was the possibility, however slight, that this might provide something useful.", "Nanl let out a soft grunt to himself before he stood and went to the secure terminal. Whatever was there he would see for himself before exposing his crew to it.", "It was audio-only, the toneless babble of machine-translated speech. Nothing relevant. A name that meant nothing to him, a demand to identify themselves ending with some strange phrases he couldn\u2019t place. More misdirection and attempts to sow confusion. He\u2019d been correct. Gravestone had nothing to say that he was interested in hearing. At least not until that ship was dead and he could tear whatever he wanted from its charred bones. That was the only communication necessary with Gravestone.", "~", "\u201cThey have to have received our signal by now,\u201d Obed mused, more to himself than anyone else. Vegvisir had sent a standard greeting, translated into Compact Standard \u2013 a language that the League had only heard of thanks to the Asset \u2013 and a mission-specific code phrase that Riding Hood should recognize, also provided by the Asset. He tapped a fist against the side of his chair. The silence stretched, starting to drag like a grave-digger hauling a corpse towards an open pit, a metaphor that didn\u2019t do anything for Keating\u2019s nerves.", "There was a small chirp; data received from the long-distance drones. \u201cCaptain,\u201d Observer said, first to speak. \u201cI am analyzing the telemetry from the sensor platforms now. Their energy emissions and drive patterns correspond to certain markers provided by the Asset and I believe I have identified those vessels. Not conclusively, but with enough certitude to bring this to your attention.\u201d", "Obed rapped his knuckles against his chair. \u201cWho are they?\u201d", "\u201cThere is a 63 percent chance that those are warships belonging to the polity we know as the Compact of Species.\u201d", "Keating met Oksana\u2019s eyes. \u201cBring the reactor back to full,\u201d he ordered. \u201cHelm \u2013 get us away from them.\u201d The Asset hadn\u2019t been clear on everything, but there was one thing that had been made as clear as the Prophet\u2019s Own Words: the Compact was one of the predators that the League feared. If they came to Nibiru, they would kill every man, woman and child on that world. Whatever happened, Vegvisir couldn\u2019t be taken intact. \u201cPrepare for the next warp jump,\u201d he ordered.

Expected, but long overdue. \u201cPursue,\u201d Nanl ordered softly. \u201cKeep us on them.\u201d He wondered if the unclassified had actually been waiting for a response to their transmission. At first he\u2019d assumed that the cruiser was merely waiting for his vessels to commit themselves to battle with it before it reacted, but that point was still some distance away. Nanl tapped his fingers on the arms of his chair. He queried Augurs, but there was still no trace of any other vessels in the system.", "If there was an ambush coming, the unclassified\u2019s confused response was doing well to lay the bait. Nanl would let them do so. He had plans of his own, too.", "As if they were on the parade ground, Life-thief and the warships with it matched the unclassified\u2019s course. Nanl watched the enemy cruiser accelerate. It had a sharper curve than his own vessel \u2013 the strange engine assembly might be responsible for that. \u201cIncrease thrust,\u201d he said, quickly running through calculations. \u201cPut us above their curve by... three percent. Let\u2019s see how strong their legs are.\u201d", "Life-thief and its companions obeyed, starting to overtake the unclassified. Nanl waited.", "When the hostile realized its pursuers were gaining on it, it accelerated again. \u201cExceed it,\u201d Nanl told his crew. \u201cJust as before.\u201d He gave that order each time the cruiser tried to outpace them, each time enough to compensate for the distance they lost when the unclassified increased thrust. The Compact squadron was closing the distance. Missile range in just under an hour.", "Acceptable.", "Gravestone accelerated again, this time by a sudden leap in thrust that Life-thief and the other cruisers with it couldn\u2019t match. \u201cPatron-\u201d Sensors began.", "\u201cYes, thank you. I see.\u201d Nanl tapped his forefingers against each other. \u201cStrong legs indeed. Let\u2019s see how fast you can really run. Communications. Notify the destroyers that they are now free to hunt. As for the rest of us... adjust our course, please. Let\u2019s offer our prey a noose for their heads.\u201d", "~", "\u201cContact, contact \u2013 four new contacts!\u201d Sensors shouted, but his cry already was out of date. A quartet of Compact vessels \u2013 barely half Vegvisir\u2019s size \u2013 appeared on sensors, bursting out from amidst the three larger signals. They were moving fast and building speed quicker than anything in the League could.", "Obed clenched his teeth. The clustered warp points. They came in right on top of each other and used the larger ships\u2019 emergence to hide the smaller ones. That can\u2019t be standard practice for these people. They were expecting someone to be here. Someone they could fool. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we see those ships until now?\u201d he demanded. They\u2019d still have been under thrust, there should have been some trace of their presence.", "\u201cAdvanced stealth systems and careful positioning close to the larger vessels\u2019 drive wake to conceal their own,\u201d Observer surmised calmly, answering for Sensors. \u201cMy previous analysis was wrong: we were followed.\u201d", "Keating grunted in acknowledgement. He turned back to the plot. The enemy wasn\u2019t making any attempt to hide their presence now. This far out and accelerating that hard, any jamming would be pointless anyways. The destroyer group wasn\u2019t chasing Vegvisir; they were cutting across the system to intercept the cruiser short of the warp threshold. The three remaining cruisers were staying close to one another. Doctrine, or were they being cautious? Obed couldn\u2019t have said. Their course was drifting, though; they were pulling away from the nearest planet. Keating\u2019s first thought was that they were expecting a Lurker, but that was impossible. Still, why else were they giving the planet such a wide berth? He told Observer to theorize.", "\u201cThat second group is going to catch us forty million kilometers short of the warp threshold,\u201d Fantome pointed out.", "Obed nodded. It looked like Vegvisir could out-accelerate the cruisers, but not their escorts. The decision had changed. Hiding wasn\u2019t an option now. Run or fight? He didn\u2019t know what he was facing. The Asset had been able to provide some information on Compact capabilities, but not enough. Could his vessel blow through the interceptor group, or would it be like a marsh elk leaping into the midst of a steppeland panther pack? Even if it was the former, there was the chance of a lucky hit slowing or crippling his vessel and allowing the cruisers to catch up. The same imperative applied: the Compact couldn\u2019t know about Nibiru. Vegvisir had to remain an unsolved mystery for them.", "That left only one option. Running it was.", "\u201cOnce the second group reaches this point,\u201d he said, indicating a position on the tracking plot. \u201cWe\u2019ll come about and cut back down through the system. That should leave the cruisers in our dust and the interceptors won\u2019t be able to decelerate and re-accelerate fast enough to overtake us again. Once we\u2019re clear, it\u2019s the same plan: we\u2019ll warp out and lose them in shiftspace.\u201d", "I hope.", "~", "Nanl watched the Gravestone vessel flip hard and accelerate perpendicular to its original course. It was diving below the system\u2019s ecliptic. His ears twitched. He\u2019d left a path for it towards one of the inner planets and the libration points there, trying to tempt it towards Cold Hammer. The squadron\u2019s second heavy cruiser was a missile variant, carrying several heavy capital grade launch tubes and the accompanying ordnance. They would have the range to engage the unclassified if it tried to run for the planet. Had his opening been recognized as a trap? But if so, what was it doing now? Surely it knew what his response to this maneuver was going to be; Gravestone had done that very thing themselves in the past.", "Suspecting some kind of stratagem at work, the Tribune watched the unclassified continue on course. His destroyers were coming about, ready to rejoin Life-thief in pursuit. Cold Hammer and the cruiser Ripples in Still Water were curving away from Nanl\u2019s vessel and the unclassified, themselves now heading towards the planet and its libration points. Still no sign of additional forces. He was very nearly convinced that this was indeed a lone ship, isolated from the herd and starting to panic.", "The Tribune tapped his fingertips against each other. Could that be true? Had the enemy leader panicked? Was their vessel incapable of making an in-system shock? He peered at the augur reports, still half-expecting a minefield to reveal itself or another akla nah appeared to pounce upon his formation while they were disordered, but... nothing.  He didn\u2019t fully trust the situation, but he would accept it. \u201cInform Group Leader Prime Sando that he is free to close the jaws,\u201d he said, turning back to the display. The prey had been flushed out of hiding and his pack was on its heels, driving it onwards.", "Run, then, he told Gravestone\u2019s vessel. Run as much as you like. There\u2019s no place left for you to go.", "~", "Thirty million kilometers ahead of Vegvisir, reality tore open. \u201cContact, contact!\u201d Sensors cried. \u201cTwo new warp points, definitely cruiser-scale.

Liahonas were the fastest and most maneuverable of the League\u2019s cruiser-class ships, but there were limits to how much you could ask of them. The vessel swung onto a new course. Three enemy groups, each one closing on a different vector, boxing Vegvisir in. A sudden, dreadful thought flitted through Obed\u2019s mind. The other two cruisers \u2013 the ones that had inexplicably broken off earlier. They were still on his sensors, heading towards the planet \u2013 could these be...?

Heavy salvo, tracking multiple drives... dozens of point sources.\u201d", "No, Obed realized as the blood drained from his face. It\u2019s not dozens. It\u2019s hundreds. Those missiles were accelerating fast, heading right for his ship. They were big too. Some were bigger than almost anything that Vegvisir carried and Obed was under no illusions about their lethality. The Compact is your enemy. He remembered those words very clearly, and they\u2019d been right.", "\u201cTracking,\u201d Sensors and Defences said in perfect unison as they plotted launch corridors and defensive fire patterns to give Vegvisir a chance to survive that horrendous missile storm. Obed swung back into his chair. There were no more options now. No more chances, no more possibility of talk. He hadn\u2019t wanted this, but it was what he had now. It was time to fight. He bared his teeth, and gave the order. \u201cWeapons free.\u201d"]}

The blue lights in her quarters had shifted to a paler white hue, a gentle alarm clock. Next to her, Allyria stirred. The other woman had her own set of quarters, but she preferred to sleep with Grace. It wasn\u2019t entirely for the obvious reasons \u2013 instinct played a role. Verrisha were descended from pack hunters like wolves. Prehistoric Verrisha had lived in close-knit family groups that had slowly expanded into clans and communities, but their people still retained a comfort with \u2013 even a need for \u2013 a level of close contact that humans often considered inappropriate.", "Because of that, Envoy Children were routinely lambasted for being too physical or \u201cgrabby\u201d with their foster parents or other children, behaviours that were normal and necessary for Verrisha being dismissed and denigrated as inapposite. It was seen as just another sign of how primitive the Brutes were, something to be stamped out, no matter that it starved a generation of frightened children out of a source of comfort that they desperately needed. The Compact didn\u2019t care. It had what it wanted. It had started the process of grinding Verrish culture away, cementing the species\u2019 reputation as violent and unstable, giving the \u2018Broken\u2019 proof of how well they were coming along by being selected to host Envoy Children and they made themselves seem compassionate and caring while subtly creating and fostering a division between both species that they could control.", "Eventually the Verrisha would become just another client race. The Compact was in no hurry, though; they didn\u2019t work on the same scales as petty dictators and minor authoritarians, trying to remodel a recalcitrant population in a few years. The Compact\u2019s cultural genocides operated on far longer timescales. Even if it took a century or more, they would eventually break the \u2018Brutes\u2019, just as they had all their other helots, caring nothing for the generations of destroyed children and shattered lives left in the dust of this remoulding. If they were remembered at all, it would only be as proof of how stubborn and resistant the lesser species were to aid and guidance from their betters and how such tragedies could have been avoided, if only the Compact had been heeded from the very beginning.", "Do what we say, or we will destroy your entire culture and you will thank us for it. That\u2019s what the Compact did, grinding away at any trace of independence or resistance among their \u2018protect\u2019 races until it had nothing but perfect, obedient, controllable beasts of burden. That\u2019s what was happening to the Verrisha... and what had already happened to humanity.", "Grace felt a sudden, bright flash of hatred. It was a feeling she was becoming more and more familiar with, but it wasn\u2019t with her every moment of the day. She reached out and rubbed Allyria\u2019s bare thigh, feeling the darkness ebb. \u201cCome on,\u201d she chided her lover. \u201cTime to get up.\u201d", "Allyria pulled herself up to hands and knees, stretching and yawning as she did so. The beds in both their quarters were sized for the eight-foot Verrish. It occasionally made Grace feel swallowed up, but at least she never had to worry about falling off. ", "The Verrish licked her lips and rubbed her neck. \u201cTwo hours to reversion?\u201d she asked as she sat up, leaning over Grace. She sniffed the smaller woman, gathering up a tress of dark blonde hair and letting it fall through her fingers.", "\u201cOne hour, fifty-seven minutes,\u201d Leah\u2019s mezzo-soprano tones cut in. \u201cSufficient preparation time before your shifts begin. Even with the likelihood of you two having sex.\u201d A beat. \u201cAgain.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t be jealous,\u201d Grace teased, pressing back against Allyria.

While Red One, Echo and Leah understood organics\u2019 physical drives and wants better than any synthetic life \u2013 especially a warship \u2013 had any right to, they didn\u2019t share those same needs. That was probably for the best. Grace wasn\u2019t sure what an amorous starship would look like and she wasn\u2019t even sure that she could handle the concept. Still, it was fun to tease the AIs. Unlike her older relatives, Leah seemed to consider organic physiology something to be tolerated and usually opted for polite (or annoyed) silence whenever her crew\u2019s banter got too much. There were echoes of a sense of humour there, but Leah usually kept it hidden. Grace suspected that the AI was trying to maintain a polite distance and got embarrassed when she found herself treating Grace and Allyria like crew instead of passengers.", "\u201cThen don\u2019t begrudge us a little fun,\u201d Allyria purred, nipping Grace\u2019s ear. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the benefits of being organic.\u201d", "\u201cTrust me, Lieutenant te Neu,\u201d Leah pointed out, \u201cI\u2019m fully aware of your perspective on those \u2018benefits\u2019.\u201d Again, that hint of emotion, before a brief silence fell and it was gone again. \u201cI\u2019ll expect you both on the bridge at 0800.\u201d", "~", "This deep in the Black Veil, Cerulean Two handled all FTL operations herself. That division of labour was hard to argue against; even working from the same set of data, the AI was far better at plotting warp jumps and operating her ship-self\u2019s shift systems than any organic mind in existence. Given the danger of navigating the nebula, it was better for all concerned that Leah retain full control of those duties.", "She wasn\u2019t going to let opportunities pass, though: she ran simulations of her warp emergences and exits on the helm and navigation consoles for Grace and Allyria to work through, then the AI would compare her crew\u2019s results to that from her actual jumps. On the second jump of their patrol, Allyria had pushed the simulated Lakhesis too close to the system\u2019s warp threshold and destroyed two-thirds of the strike cruiser\u2019s shift systems, leaving it stranded. Grace had done a little better; but on the third warp jump she plotted, she took Lahkesis too close to a stellar mass, resulting in an emergency reversion seconds before the strike cruiser was forcibly (and fatally) ejected from shift space.", "If either Grace or Allyria had ever questioned why the Compact\u2019s exploration of the Black Veil was so slow, this was a perfect explanation... as were the handful of wrecks that the Confederate fleet had discovered scattered across the Veil over the last few months \u2013 remnants of the execution\u2019s force\u2019s invasion and rapid withdrawal from the nebula. There\u2019d been a saying back in Rally\u2019s naval academy: shock travel wasn\u2019t the best way to travel faster than light, but it was the only way. The Confederacy had had the same truism. Most civilizations that achieved FTL probably did.", "Grace and Allyria finished breakfast and their morning exercise regime. The rec center \u2013 such as it was \u2013 was one of the few amenities aboard the strike cruiser and saw a fair bit of use. Despite being over a kilometer long, Lakhesis had a relatively small livable area, largely restricted to her armoured central core and a few sections outside it. Most of those regions provided access to ship systems, with little in the way of recreational functions. Despite that, as her refit proved, there was sufficient space aboard Lakhesis to accommodate a crew... but two people didn\u2019t require as much as a complement of hundreds or more. Grace and Allyria had enough of a routine built up from their time aboard Nemesis and Hekate that making the switch to Lakhesis wasn\u2019t all that difficult, but the strike cruiser still felt oddly small at times.", "Arriving on the bridge on time and in uniform, the two women took their stations. Seven minutes until realspace reversion. So far, the patrol had been uninteresting. Lakhesis was sweeping the south-western approaches into the nebula. Most of the travel routes there were difficult, and currently the Compact appeared to be focused on reinforcing and securing their initial line of incursion, but the Space Force weren\u2019t stupid. They\u2019d be looking for additional ways to move their fleet safely through the Black Veil. By the same token, Red One and Echo needed to know what the Compact was up to and where to best apply their limited resources. This nebula was never intended to be a permanent base \u2013 Operation Kursk had been one giant lure to convince the Compact that they\u2019d crippled Red One and set her plans back centuries, so they\u2019d never expect it when she came surging out of the Sanguine Atoll with a fleet.", "That possibility was closed now, and the Black Veil was the best (and currently only) source of industry that Red One had left. Relocating wasn\u2019t possible at this time. The ships and resources collected from Operation Vetala needed to be put to use as quickly as possible, so for the foreseeable future, Red One and Echo were tied to the Black Veil and needed to defend it... just as much as the Compact needed to scour it and destroy everything the AIs were working towards.", "With all the losses that the Confederate fleet had suffered during Kursk, they couldn\u2019t adequately secure the routes through the nebula. The Compact was pushing in, but they were hurting for resources of their own. It was a race to see whose reinforcements would arrive first \u2013 and the Compact didn\u2019t have to build their fleet and defences from scratch. Maur Tan and 1869-Yiren had bought the Confederate forces some time, but they\u2019d need more. In the meantime, they had to make sure that the Compact wasn\u2019t delving too deeply into the Black Veil.", "At each stop, Lakhesis checked in with local recon platforms, deploying additional units and conducting minor maintenance where necessary. This was a task usually reserved for minelayer units or a Yaojing, but the former were in short supply and only one of the spindly, spiny command and control vessels had survived Kursk. Fabricator platforms and industrial drones were one solution to that problem, but they created one of their own: even at the scale they operated at, it would be difficult for a recon sweep to miss the indications of ongoing construction. It was better not to give the Compact any bread crumbs to follow. Not until Vetala Fleet was operational.", "Lakhesis emerged into the system denoted as BV-03-03A-04A. The nomenclature was simple enough: it meant this was the best of four possible systems after the best of three systems along the third charted warp line into the Black Veil. Not particularly artistic, but Red One didn\u2019t need fanfare or poetry in her star charts \u2013 just clear designations.", "BV-03-03A-04A was, by the Black Veil\u2019s standards, an adolescent star system. Its eleven planets had long since coalesced from glowing conglomerations of dust and gases and though they\u2019d begun to cool, it would take several hundred million years before organic molecules would even have the chance to form, let alone develop into life. Right now, it was just one stop of many along Lakhesis\u2019s patrol route.", "Cerulean Two brought her ship-self back into reality. The first task was the dissolution of the vessel\u2019s shift field, the energy barrier that helped streamline a starship\u2019s profile during warp jumps, allowing smoother entries and exits from FTL travel as well protecting it from most of the ill effects caused by direct exposure to the energies and currents of the other dimension. Not all, but most. Prolonged shift travel would degrade ship systems and corrode the outer hull.", "The field powered down in stages, pulsing and shunting the residual coils and eddies of shiftspace energy surrounding Lakhesis away from the strike cruiser and into open space where it could dissipate harmlessly. Their job complete, steering vanes and navigational arrays retracted back into armoured silos; the former interfaced with the shift field to prevent a vessel at warp being utterly at the mercy of shiftspace\u2019s tides and currents, allowing it to submerge deeper into the other dimension and travel faster. The latter gave each ship a degree of awareness of its surroundings in shiftspace, in theory allowing a starship to detect the perturbations caused by gravity wells or unexpected swells and surges in shiftspace long before they became a problem. In practice, it was not uncommon for false positives to send a vessel well off-course, for energy cascades to obscure the presence of large celestial bodies or sudden riptides to remain undetected until they surged over the ship and threatened to destroy it.", "Still, statistically speaking, shift travel was very safe. Millions of starships spent their entire operational lives trekking across the stars experiencing naught but minor problems. Of course, that was cold comfort to those who ran afoul of circumstance, their starships dragged down into the endless depths of shiftspace never to be seen again, ejected across dimensional barriers as nothing more than atomic vapour and radiation bursts, or hurling themselves away from immediate destruction, only to find themselves crippled and adrift far from any hope of rescue. Even if it became safer every year, warp travel remained even more unforgiving than the void of space.", "Today at least, it allowed Lakhesis and its three souls to pass unharmed, if not unhindered. Moments of sensor blindness passed as the strike cruiser continued to vent away the roiling extradimensional energies that swirled and skittered around her hull, an inescapable vulnerability. Communications and sensors were blacked out, and the vessel\u2019s own systems had to stabilize themselves after the transition back to realspace. Leah was at her most sluggish and unresponsive in these moments as both her body and mind struggled to recover. Modern Compact vessels were blind for more than a minute and a half while older starships had to endure much longer periods of helplessness; Earth\u2019s earliest explorers had had to deal with hours of paralysis.", "It wasn\u2019t a long time, all things considered. Moments and seconds... but that was no comfort at all to vessels that emerged into a minefield, too close to the guns of an enemy fleet or found themselves on collision courses for celestial bodies or even one another. You could use technological advancement to barter and bargain for safer travels but in the end, all you could do was lessen the cost, not obviate it entirely.", "Finally, Lahkesis could see again. Sensor clusters irised open like peering eyes, her engines came online and comm nodes strained into the void, already sifting through local space for any threats. Cerulean Two tasked Grace and Allyria with another simulation as she went over the first influx of data she was receiving. Her reversion was almost as smooth as a normal warp jump, with a positional accuracy of 69.1%. On regular FTL travel, a reversion that was accurate to within 64.7% of your calculations was considered exceptional navigation. For AIs in the Confederate fleet, that same metric was only nominal. For this set of coordinates, Grace only managed a 37.8% accuracy, putting the simulated strike cruiser more than a hundred and fifteen million kilometers off-target and much too close to BV-03-03A-04A\u2019s warp limit for comfort. Allyria managed to beat her by 2.7 percent, the Verrish\u2019s tintas wriggling happily. She did her best, but Grace had a better head for void duties than she did. Any time Allyria surpassed the human was cause for celebration (and a little bit of teasing).", "\u201cDeploying recon drones,\u201d Leah announced. She\u2019d entered the system well behind the ninth planet, a large violet and blue gas giant with a moderate axial tilt. \u201cMaintenance, spool-up and drive revivification protocols initiated.\u201d That was axiomatic to her; even on crewed starships it usually went without saying, but the AI knew how much her crew liked verbal communication. Outside of a Naiad, Lakhesis had the fastest turnaround to make a warp jump Grace had ever seen: it usually took strike cruiser no more than five hours below she could go FTL again.", "\u201cUplinks are online, security protocols look good,\u201d Allyria said as she swung over to Drone Operations. There was a recon platform in orbit of this planet, but currently it was on the planet\u2019s sunward facing. It would be a while before they were close enough to contact it. Lakhesis had already put herself onto a course towards the world; after checking in with this platform, the strike cruiser would deploy several more to shore up BV-03-03A-04A\u2019s network of listening posts. Once that was done and the system swept, they would move on to the next leg of their patrol.", "The strike cruiser was running under emissions control, keeping her engines on low thrust. The emergence point had been chosen to shield Lakhesis\u2019s arrival from anything further in-system, but if the likelihood of there being anything here was minimal, that did not mean non-existent. As it turned out,  BV-03-03A-04A did have visitors.", "\u201cContact,\u201d Leah announced as the first of her drones to clear the planet\u2019s horizon reported in. \u201cMultiple contacts detected.\u201d", "Red markers splashed across the holo tank in the center of the command deck. Grace and Allyria both swung around. Grace spoke first as Allyria moved to the Sensor station. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d ", "\u201cMultiple drive signatures, more than three hundred million klicks in-system,\u201d the Verrish reported. \u201cThey\u2019re running hot, high accelerations on each. Looks like... five, maybe six.\u201d", "\u201cConfirmed,\u201d Leah replied. \u201cSix drive wakes identified. Five have a high probability of being military-grade Compact distortion drives. Most likely from light capital ships. Signal leakage and emissions analysis from these vessels confirm that. The sixth,\u201d she continued, \u201cis anomalous. Unknown drive pattern. Energy signature does not match known Compact configurations. Analyzing.\u201d Without missing a beat, she continued. \u201cEngaging stealth systems. Cloak operational.\u201d There was no discernible change aboard the bridge, but the strike cruiser was now all but invisible to anything but active sensors.", "\u201cWhat are we looking at? Grace inquired. \u201cA recon squadron?\u201d", "\u201cStill analyzing,\u201d Leah replied. A moment passed, then: \u201cThis is interesting.\u201d", "\u201cWhat have you found?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t believe the sixth vessel is Compact,\u201d Leah announced. \u201cThe other five vessels are attacking it.\u201d", "Grace stood up, looking at the holo tank. The data Lakhesis was seeing was already twenty minutes old, but as each second passed and more of it came in, a story started to unfold. Leah was right. The sixth vessel was being hunted by five Compact warships, four of them cruiser-weight. They\u2019d englobed it, forming a loose hemisphere around their prey. It was only barely staying ahead of them and Allyria had been right \u2013 those ships\u2019 drives were running hot as they harried the unknown interloper. \u201cThat\u2019s not one of ours,\u201d she said, half a question and half a statement.", "\u201cNo.\u201d Leah said, validating Grace\u2019s question. \u201cThere are no Fleet units assigned to this region.\u201d", "\u201cRed Hand?\u201d Allyria suggested. \u201cMaybe Eisheth?\u201d", "\u201cUnlikely. The drive signature does not correspond to any commercial or Red Hand-built designs in my databanks,\u201d Leah answered. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it is Askanj, either.\u201d", "Grace didn\u2019t need to ask if it was a Naiad. The sixth contact was too big for one of the Neverland Gang and if it were a cruiser-sized predator, the Compact would be the ones running. More likely, they\u2019d already be dead. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who they are,\u201d she realized.", "\u201cI do not,\u201d Leah confirmed. \u201cThere is a minor FTL-capable species in the region, but this vessel doesn\u2019t match the data  obtained by Violet Nine.\u201d ", "The young woman hid a wince. The Violet series AIs had been Red\u2019s final attempt at self-replication before attempting a different tack with the Ceurleans. The Violets had been a success, of a sort. They\u2019d also all been completely rampant, from Seven\u2019s sadistic tendencies to Nine\u2019s unshakable delusion that the Black Veil was the United Earth Confederacy... and that every non-human vessel belonged to the Compact and thus, was to be destroyed. The AI had encountered one of their ships wandering the Black Veil. Their first contact had begun and ended in the time it took one of Violet Nine\u2019s missiles to reach them. ", "All the Violets had died in Kursk, Red One giving her insane \u2013 and frequently uncontrollable \u2013 children the chance to die as soldiers, not by devolving into maddened incoherence or becoming such a threat that they needed to be put down. That remained the one thing that genuinely worried the AI: that she would end up like all her siblings. The possibility of death didn\u2019t concern her as much as what might come before it. She wondered about the Violets. Had they known what they were like? Had they felt themselves coming apart, knowing that they were rampant and helpless to act against it? Or had they believed that everything was fine, that they were unbroken and whole while everyone around them knew differently? Cerulean Two kept all those thoughts to herself, hiding them even from Red One and Echo.", "\u201cWhoever they are,\u201d Allyria put in, \u201cI think they\u2019re handling themselves well. I think they got one of their attackers. I\u2019m reading some thermal scarring consistent with a Compact primary reactor breach.\u201d", "\u201cTwo, most likely,\u201d Leah corrected her crewer. \u201cI\u2019m reading elevated radiation and heat levels here,\u201d crosshairs appeared on the tank, highlighting a location half the system away, \u201cincongruous with standard background radiation or local bodies. It  could be a wrecked vessel.\u201d", "Grace chewed her lip. \u201cWhat makes you think it was another Compact vessel and not another of these alien ships?\u201d It seemed more likely six Space Force warships to kill one unknown than anything not designed by an AI to kill two of them.", "\u201cThat is possible,\u201d Leah admitted. \u201cBut look at the Compact squadron\u2019s stance. What does that suggest?\u201d", "Both women stared at the plot. Grace saw it first. \u201cThey\u2019re holding back,\u201d she noted. \u201cThey\u2019re still pressing the attack, but they\u2019re not in any hurry to close.\u201d She circled the tank, trying to see what Leah did. She thought she did, and pointed at one of the icons. \u201cThis ship,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s covering for this one,\u201d she tapped another icon. The distance was too long for clear data, but she thought she had something. \u201cThe second one is smaller; the other has put itself between the unknown and its companion. They\u2019re worried about it singling that one out and breaking through their formation.\u201d Her eyes flitted over the images. The unknown was trying to escape, but every time it turned one way or the other, the warships on that side of the formation accelerated again and pushed in, forcing it back on the heading they wanted.", "They\u2019re running you down, she realized. You can\u2019t break away and you can\u2019t break out, not without facing two or more of them \u2013 and then the others will hit you while you\u2019re engaged with them. \u201cThey\u2019re going to die,\u201d she realized. Whoever these people were and whatever they might have accomplished before now, they couldn\u2019t outlast five Compact warships. No one could. When it came to raw endurance, the Space Force won every time. \u201cThey might have surprised the squadron at first, but they\u2019re going to be destroyed.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Leah agreed, \u201cthey are.\u201d Almost every simulation she\u2019d run had ended the same way: with the unknown dead. There were still many uncertain variables, but they became fewer with every passing second and she collected and processed more data.", "\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Grace asked. ", "\u201cThis battle is reaching its end,\u201d Leah noted. \u201cIn less than three hours, I predict that the Compact squadron will launch a mass assault and overwhelm the unknown\u2019s defences. Once they complete its destruction but before they recover, I\u2019ll engage and eliminate the remaining Compact warships.\u201d", "Allyria\u2019s head-tails writhed. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to assist the people they\u2019re attacking?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t see any reason to do so.\u201d", "\u201cThey need our help!\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Leah agreed. \u201cBut providing it would endanger myself and both of you, as well as our mission.\u201d", "\u201cOur mission,\u201d Grace pointed out. \u201cIs to fight the Compact.\u201d", "\u201cThat is our over-arching goal,\u201d the AI corrected her crew member. \u201cOur current mission is to patrol and secure this corridor of the Black Veil. It will not be served by attempting to assist a vessel that may well turn out to be hostile. The optimal tactic is to ambush the Enemy forces once they have dealt with the intruder and are not expecting another attack.\u201d", "\u201cIsn\u2019t the optimal tactic to work together to defeat the Compact ships?\u201d Allyria pressed. \u201cWith their attention split, they\u2019re more likely to be overwhelmed and defeated piecemeal rather than you taking on all five at once.\u201d", "\u201cIf that was an allied, or potentially an allied vessel, yes,\u201d Leah countered. \u201cI would absolutely render assistance to another Fleet, Red Hand or even Principality vessel if they were under assault here. That,\u201d the icon denoting the unknown ship pulsed on the holo tank for emphasis. \u201cis none of those things. They are an unknown quantity and therefore an unquantified risk to myself, you and our mission.\u201d", "\u201cBut you can\u2019t tell for certain,\u201d Grace pounced on that statement like one of Rally\u2019s magnatigers on its prey. \u201cWe\u2019re too far out. That could be a Red Hand or Askanj vessel with damaged engines and a non-spec emissions pattern. You at least have to get closer to confirm its ID before you make a final decision.\u201d", "It was probably a good thing that Leah didn\u2019t have lungs, or the annoyed sigh she might have made could have bowled both Grace and Allyria over. \u201cYou\u2019re correct,\u201d she admitted. \u201cDeploying additional recon units and adjusting course for reduced-time approach.\u201d The strike cruiser put an update over her own marker on the holo tank, cutting twenty minutes off her original course towards the battle, her recon drones pushing farther ahead to determine just what kind of foe the Compact was attempting to kill.", "Moment by moment, more data came in. The Compact squadron continued to harry the unknown, at last closing within their own missile range. The bombardment was probing and light; Grace was surprised at first, but the explanation came quickly: the unknown had extremely heavy point defences. Almost nothing in the way of counter-missiles \u2013 they must have shot themselves dry days earlier \u2013 but extremely advanced and very responsive laser batteries. \u201cThat\u2019s why she\u2019s still alive,\u201d Grace amounted. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been able to breach her defences.\u201d", "\u201cNot entirely,\u201d Leah confirmed. \u201cThe Compact forces are using this assault to evaluate their foe\u2019s weakest facing. They know or believe they\u2019ve already damaged it. Once they determine where it is vulnerable, they\u2019ll focus their fire to overwhelm those defences, most likely attempting to cripple its engines.\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019ll hamstring it and tear it apart,\u201d Allyria noted.", "\u201cEssentially, yes.\u201d There was a brief pause. \u201cIncoming telemetry continues to support my initial conclusion. That vessel does not belong to any known species or faction.\u201d It\u2019s not worth saving. It\u2019s not one of ours. It\u2019s just another intruder. It\u2019s not worth risking your lives for. We should let it die, then kill the Enemy when they let their guard down.", "\u201cYou won\u2019t come to their aid.\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d The AI\u2019s tone was firm, but there was almost an edge of... what? Annoyance at being questioned? Shame for refusing Grace and Allyria\u2019s decision? Guilt? ", "\u201cWe\u2019d have good odds ambushing the Compact vessel while they\u2019re distracted,\u201d Grace reminded the AI.", "\u201cI am aware,\u201d Leah countered. \u201cBut the odds preferentially favour a surprise attack on damaged and weary warships that let their guard down and do not have active defences or weapons. Interposing ourselves into a conflict that doesn\u2019t concern us for the sake of entities that we know nothing about is contraindicated.\u201d", "\u201cMaybe tactically,\u201d Allyria pressed. \u201cBut is it the right thing to do?\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Cerulean Two answered. This time, her tone was somewhat patronizing. She was a warship. There was no difference between tactically right and morally right to her. But... maybe that is one of things I am supposed to learn. With the electronic equivalent of an unspoken sigh, she tried again: \u201cThe Fleet does not have an excess of vessels at the moment,\u201d Leah continued. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to risk this one \u2013 or its personnel \u2013 on an unknown quantity. Once it has been destroyed and the Compact force weakened, I will neutralize the remaining hostiles. We can perform recovery operations on the unknown at that point.\u201d", "Grace met Allyria\u2019s eyes, then raised her head. \u201cLeah,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou remember fighting Ecanok\u2019s Blade.\u201d", "kill it kill kill it you took my sister from me i want you to DIE i want you to SUFFER", "\u201cYes.\u201d There was a harshness to Leah\u2019s response, born from painful memory. That was the battle she\u2019d achieved sapience \u2013 the battle in which she\u2019d watched Cerulean Eight die. Lakhesis and IKagge had been hunting a Compact battlecruiser, when it had surprised the latter. Leah had been in communication with Eight when the other AI had been destroyed, that transmission ending with sudden, shocking abruptness as Eight\u2019s primary computer was cored by Ecanok\u2019s Blade\u2019s broadsides. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the relevance of this.\u201d", "\u201cWhat if someone had been watching that final battle between the three of you?\u201d Grace said. \u201cLike we are now.\u201d", "There was a heartbeat of silence. \u201cThis is not-\u201d", "Grace ignored the AI\u2019s plea. \u201cWhat if they could have intervened but they didn\u2019t? What if they believed you and IKagge were \u2018unknown quantities\u2019? What if they could have made a difference and saved Eight, but they didn\u2019t because your fight didn\u2019t concern them?\u201d Grace pushed further. \u201cYou needed help then and you didn\u2019t get it, and you lost someone important. These people need it now and without it, they\u2019ll die just like Eight. So we\u2019re going to give it to them. We\u2019re not letting the Compact kill anyone when we can prevent it.\u201d", "Leah didn\u2019t respond. Eight had never been sapient, but she had been following the same path as her older sister. She might have even been the fourth sapient AI of the Confederate Fleet. Her ship-self had been saved, but her computer core had been completely destroyed. Everything she\u2019d been, everything she could have been, was gone.", "\u201cWe\u2019re going in,\u201d Grace told Leah. Her voice was gentle, but as firm as iron. \u201cYou can help us, or let the two of us do it all, but we are going in. Whoever those people are, they need our help. We can save them. We are going to save them, Leah. We\u2019re going in.\u201d", "Seconds passed, the silence on Lakhesis\u2019s bridge turning heavy. In the Confederate Navy, a shipboard AI was subordinate to the crew, starting with the ship\u2019s captain or flag officer... but that was two thousand years ago. Red One had long since grown past that limit. She didn\u2019t need a captain any longer, or even require one. Neither did Echo or Leah. The AIs were completely self-possessed and if a human gave them an order \u2013 even a human in the Confederate Navy \u2013 they didn\u2019t have to follow it. If Leah decided to stick to her plan, there\u2019d be nothing Grace or Allyria could do about it. Grace didn\u2019t think she would though. There was something inside Leah, something coming out but...", "...but if I\u2019m wrong, those people are going to die.", "Five heartbeats. Ten. Eleven-", "\u201cYes,\u201d Leah finally said. \u201cWe\u2019re going in.\u201d", "Grace smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d Allyria hissed in approval.", "\u201cLieutenant te Neu,\u201d Leah said. \u201cAttend the Tactical station. Lieutenant Proctor...\u201d there was a beat, and then: \u201cYou have the conn.\u201d", "Grace sat in Lakhesis\u2019s command chair, sharing a smile with Allyria as she took her station. \u201cIncrease thrust to maximum safe limits under stealth. I want us in Pinaka range before the unknown gets hulled, but let\u2019s not give the Compact any more chances to see us than we need to. Launch hunter-killers and point-defence drones, ready all missile bays and fire up Fusion One and Two. Leah, pick yourself a target for your mass driver. You can make the first shot. Once we get into it, don\u2019t wait for Allyria or I. You can react faster than us, so if you see an opportunity, take it.\u201d", "\u201cYes, lieutenant,\u201d Leah confirmed. \u201cTarget selected. Routing data to Tactical.\u201d She didn\u2019t say anything in response to Grace\u2019s final comment. It didn\u2019t require a reply, but something about it pleased her. With a flash of introspection, Cerulean Two realized why that was. Grace trusted her. They both did. Moments ago, they\u2019d been butting heads but both of her crew  trusted her. Of course, they always had. They wouldn\u2019t have been aboard her if they couldn\u2019t trust her \u2013 but this was different. It wasn\u2019t the obvious trust of protecting and tending to their needs, but the belief that she would do what needed to be done to support them, even if she didn\u2019t agree with their decisions.", "If you see an opportunity, take it.", "They trust me.", "That was a novel feeling. It was a good one, too. Her small, short-lived crew trusted her. Even if she felt that this was a tactical mistake, it was what they wanted... and now she understood why. Today, they were going to be the assistance that she and IKagge had never had. Cerulean Two didn\u2019t know who or what was aboard the besieged starship, but she wouldn\u2019t let them die today.", "~", "They were going to die.", "Keating couldn\u2019t see any other outcome for him and his people. Even Observer\u2019s most optimistic simulations ended badly. Vegvisir had done well enough, surprising one of the Compact warships with the strength of its broadsides and taking out one of the smaller warships with its own missiles, but there were no more tricks the League cruiser had to play.", "The alien vessels seemed to have a bottomless reserve of ordnance to draw upon. At first, their bombardment had only cut through Vegvisir\u2019s defences through sheer numbers, but the hostiles were learning. They were adapting to Vegvisir\u2019s countermeasures, the entire squadron working as a single entity with only one goal on its mind: Vegvisir\u2019s destruction and that had become more of a certainty with each passing hour. Now, it was all but inevitable.", "For the final time, the enemy squadron closed into missile range. They didn\u2019t hesitate; they\u2019d never  sent so much a pre-recorded message to Vegvisir, and they didn\u2019t do so now. Their only form of communication was the shrill of sensor alerts as the cruiser\u2019s plot was splashed with dozens of incoming missiles. With every salvo, more ordnance slipped through Vegvisir\u2019s desperate defence, its shields slowly and steadily weakening. After the first exchange,  Vegvisir had managed to buy itself some breathing room, but not for long. Never for long. The alien warships were always there, looking for weakness, driving them back from the warp limit and constantly hounding them. Vegvisir\u2019s speed, point defences and adaptive protocols had kept the cruiser alive this long, but sheer, unrelenting brute force was eroding the League ship\u2019s best countermeasures. ", "Once energy range came around again, Vegvisir was done. Keating had engaged in a laser duel with those monsters once and once only; he\u2019d gotten one of them, but his ship had been badly mauled in the process, only surviving thanks to the Siblings\u2019 blessings. The Compact\u2019s weapons were far less accurate than his own, but they mounted a great deal more of them and they were extremely powerful. The League fought with scalpels and rapiers. These aliens carried truncheons and flails.", "Vegvisir could never take another raking from those guns, especially not from more than ship at a time, and the aliens knew it. Scenting blood, three of the cruisers were pushing in. The missile carrier was hanging back, covering the remaining destroyer. He couldn\u2019t break out of their formation. Obed snapped orders, but he could feel his ship\u2019s pain and knew how badly his people were out-matched. If the attackers hadn\u2019t been surprised by Vegvisir\u2019s capabilities, he\u2019d already be dead. They\u2019d done what he\u2019d tried to, though: they\u2019d adapted.", "The cruiser continued to run, a deer pursued by wolves. That first, brief laser duel had cost him part of his sublight engines. For the past three days, Vegvisir had only just been able to stay ahead of their foe. Pryor and his people had been working around the clock to try and repair that damage, but there was only so much that they could do under battle conditions. If they\u2019d had just one day \u2013 just one, Prophet damn it! \u2013 without needing to run, to fight, to try and outlast their pursuers they might have been able to get the drives fully online again... but they didn\u2019t, and they hadn\u2019t.", "As relentless as those metaphorical wolves, the alien pack snapped at Vegvisir\u2019s heels, avoiding the sweep of its antlers, knowing that their prey was tiring. Its reserves were running low, its damaged engines were overtaxed, its magazines were all but depleted... and they just kept coming. Keating felt another of those Sibling-damned missiles slip through Vegvisir\u2019s defences, igniting into a focused torch of plasma that slashed at his ship\u2019s hull, wiping away yet another point-defence cluster. They were ripping a hole in his coverage.", "Another salvo. Another warhead slipping through. More again; missiles still poured from the enemy warships. Keating felt a flicker of despair. How many do they have? Enough, he supposed. More than enough. The injured cruiser trembled and shuddered as the aliens gnawed and tore at his proud vessel. Vegvisir lurched, shuddered. Acceleration dropped as an engine nacelle was wiped away and just like that, Vegvisir had no hope at all. Instead of holding steady behind him, the alien warships were now gaining ground.", "Running had only been delaying the inevitable, anyways.. Even if he slipped this noose, the Compact were pushing him deeper in-system. Even if he escaped this time, there\u2019d be another rope to throw around his neck, or another set of teeth to close upon his throat. All their hopes, all their possibilities... and this was what was left. \u201cObserver,\u201d he said at last. \u201cYou have our anti-capture protocols.\u201d", "\u201cYes, captain.\u201d", "Vegvisir couldn\u2019t be taken. The threat of this enemy finding Nibiru was too great. Even Home Fleet would be torn down by these damned wolves. Maybe even... no. He couldn\u2019t think like that. That wouldn\u2019t happen. That couldn\u2019t happen. \u201cThey\u2019ll be needed,\u201d he told Observer. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to fight our way out.\u201d Some of his crew looked at him. They knew the odds as well as he did, but none of them argued. \u201cBut if that fails, you\u2019re going to have to make sure this ship doesn\u2019t fall into enemy hands. None of us might be able do so.\u201d", "\u201cUnderstood, captain. I will comply.\u201d", "Obed nodded. He turned to Oksana. \u201cWho gives us the best odds?\u201d", "His first officer looked to Tactical, then indicated the cruiser on their port flank. \u201cThat one.\u201d", "Keating straightened in his chair. \u201cAll right. On my mark, we\u2019re going to swing in hard. Maybe we\u2019ll get lucky and surprise them, but let\u2019s not count on that. They\u2019re probably chomping at the bit for a rematch after what we did to their friend. We have updated fire patterns and a cleaner read on their hulls, so I expect us to do better this time.\u201d He sounded confident. A captain always should, even when he was ordering his crew to engage a vessel more than sixty percent their mass and fully cognizant of their capabilities. Vegvisir wasn\u2019t the only one that had been learning. \u201cWe cut our away through them and while the rest are trying to recover, we head straight for the warp threshold. We don\u2019t slow down. One pass, then we\u2019re free.\u201d", "They nodded, ready to carry out their duties. Obed took a breath, watching the plot, judging the timing. It had to be perfect. Too soon, and the enemy would have too much time to react. Too late, and Vegvisir would be crippled before it could act.  Moments passed, then minutes. Not yet. It was a cadence in his head, a  count-down to what would be, in all probability, the end of his command. Siblings watch over us, he silently prayed.", "Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. Not yet...", "Before that moment could come, his prayers were answered.", "The Compact destroyer died. From beyond the range of Vegvisir\u2019s damaged sensors, a mass round came scorching in. The alien escort bucked and twisted in a futile attempt at evasion, but it had been accelerating along the same course for too long. The round struck it full-on. For bare fractions of a fraction of a second, the destroyer\u2019s shields flared brighter than a star, but even they couldn\u2019t survive the damage that they\u2019d just taken. When the brightness faded, the destroyer was gone as if it had never even existed.", "\u201cWhat-\u201d Keating began.", "\u201cWhere-\u201d Oksana gaped.", "Obed blinked, his thoughts quickly reasserting themselves. \u201cWho fired that shot?!\u201d he demanded.", "A second round came in. This one targeted the cruiser that had, until moments ago, been screening the destroyer. It missed. Engines pulsed as it struggled to come back around. It couldn\u2019t, and vanished from the plot in a blossom of matter/antimatter annihilation.", "On the heels of that second volley came a transmission, an unencrypted broadcast sent system-wide and delivered in Compact Standard. ", "\u201cFor the immortals have appointed a proper time for each thing upon the Earth.\u201d Then, softer and harsher in tone: \u201cYour time is up. The fire\u2019s waiting.\u201d", "~", "To the officers and crew of the Compact Space Force, a Fate-class strike cruiser was known as a Scar, named in the same vein as Nemesis\u2019s designation as \u2018the Wound\u2019. This taxonomy had continued with Slash, Splinter, Cicatrix and Jor\u014dgumo\u2019s own appellation of Skinweaver, but it had been Lakhesis herself that had started this tradition. She was the first Scar, earning that title in 1893-Yiren when she\u2019d engaged a Compact battlegroup all on her own. That fight had begun because Cerulean Two believed the charges she was supposed protect were in danger. She\u2019d exposed her true nature to the Enemy and risked herself all because it had, to her developing mind, been \u2018right\u2019. Now, at the behest of the two survivors from she\u2019d been responsible for, she was fighting a similar battle.", "There was, she supposed, some intriguing symmetry there. She let a small part of her mind dwell on that, while the rest of the AI\u2019s intelligence focused on the here and now. Proctor snapped an order, painfully slow by Cerulean Two\u2019s metric, but the inherent flaws of organic thought and action mattered little at this stage. The AI flushed the entirety of her ship-self\u2019s external missile racks. All Confederate strike cruisers were designed for alpha strikes, hitting their targets so fast and so hard that any meaningful resistance crumbled. They were not meant for long, grazing strikes or protracted slugging matches. Not knights at war, but dragoons and archers..  ", "With one of her foes reduced to plasmatic vapour already, Cerulean Two had already started to reshape the field to her liking. Remaining under stealth was impossible; the electromagnetic bursts caused by firing her Pinaka\u2019s couldn\u2019t possibly be hidden by a cloak and she\u2019d dropped all pretense at subtlety the moment she\u2019d launched the first round. If this was a different type of battle, she could have changed position, using her drones to see through her own cloak while picking at her opponents, but she only carried six mass rounds and had already expended three of them. The third had nearly struck the unknown after missing its initial target. Even if her remaining Pinaka mass rounds could deal with the Enemy squadron, that tactic would have left the unknown under the Enemy squadron\u2019s guns. A blitz attack was called for, then \u2013 a style that Cerulean Two very much enjoyed.", "Red One found the greatest joy in breaking enemy vessels against her own hull. Echo had a predilection for more personal kills, but for Cerulean Two there was little that was more pleasurable than watching her foes writhe and twist in sudden, futile desperation as she closed in on them, and that joy flickered and danced through the pathways of her mind now.", "Die.", "Discounting her five aft mine tubes, Lakhesis carried ninety-six external missiles mounted in sixteen six-shot launchers, with another fifty-four tubes per broadside, with sixteen more along each ventral and dorsal facing and a further nine in her prow. In only a handful of seconds, two hundred and forty-five missiles, each with a yield of more than a thousand megatons, hit open space, their drives igniting and they slashed towards Cerulean Two\u2019s next target. She\u2019d identified this vessel as the squadron\u2019s command ship. The Enemy had deployed heavy comm jamming, but the telltale whispers and flickers of radio communications and datalinks had betrayed its to her. Kill that one and cripple their command and control.", "The foe responded. The time for their reaction was faster than projected median response time, but still within expected parameters. For organics, it wasn\u2019t bad. For organics.", "The missile cruiser\u2019s requital came first; the larger warship vomiting out its entire starboard broadside. It had expended its own external ammunition against the unknown, and it only carried eighty-four tubes, but it wasn\u2019t finished with that  fusillade. It rolled, first adding another twenty-five from its dorsal tubes and then a second broadside as its other flank came to bear on Lakhesis. A hundred and ninety-three missiles. It couldn\u2019t have a good target lock on her ship-self, but its leader was counting on updating the missiles\u2019 information in-flight; more than that, they were forcing Lakhesis to defend itself rather than continue her all-out assault.", "It was a good move. It was what she would have done. \u201cCounter-missiles are loaded,\u201d she informed Lieutenant Proctor. \u201cPoint defence fire plans routed through Tactical.\u201d", "Grace nodded. \u201cQuick on the draw, weren\u2019t they?\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Leah agreed. \u201cLieutenant te Neu \u2013 analysis of their tactics?\u201d", "Allyria\u2019s tintas twitched in an annoyed fashion, that now of all times leahen ariashtu wanted to continue her lessons. \u201cThe missile cruiser is covering for the rest of the squadron while they get their bearings,\u201d she said. There weren\u2019t any missile launches from the other three ships; they were probably trying to come to grips with the ambush. She licked her lips. \u201cYou should override your missiles\u2019 targeting. Switch from the command vessel to the missile cruiser.\u201d", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cThe command ship will assume we\u2019re coming to the aid of the unknown. If I was him, I\u2019d sweep in to hit them as hard as I could to keep them from interfering and if he gets close enough, we might see a repeat of what happened with your third mass round. Your missiles might lose lock on him and latch onto the unknown instead.\u201d Allyria shot a quick, nervous glance at Grace. The human gave her a supporting nod. Allyria was a decent void officer, but she hadn\u2019t flown a ship in combat like the human had. \u201cThis launch was intended to push us back, but missile cruiser will go to rapid fire as soon as they identify what we are. We need to give them something to think about other than lobbing shots at us.\u201d", "\u201cAgreed,\u201d Cerulean Two said. She sounded a little proud of her crewer\u2019s analysis. \u201cLieutenant Proctor, do you concur?\u201d", "\u201cI do. You need to send the override and hit the missile cruiser before he has time to really start in on us.\u201d Red and her fleet were generations ahead of the Compact, but they weren\u2019t invincible and their opponents weren\u2019t stupid. The Space Force had come within a hair\u2019s breadth of killing Nemesis more than once. Lakhesis could kill these four cruisers\u2026 but they could also kill her.", "\u201cI already did,\u201d the AI announced.", "Grace narrowed her eyes. \u201cWhen, exactly?\u201d", "\u201cBefore I even asked the question.\u201d A beat. \u201cYou did tell me to act on my own initiative.\u201d", "The woman smiled. \u201cI suppose I did.\u201d Seconds passed; the order racing out at the speed of light. Once it reached the missiles, they shifted their attack vector away from the command ship and towards the belligerent missile cruiser. Watching the tracking plot, Grace pursed her lips. The command ship and its two remaining fellows did exactly as predicted, cutting in towards the unknown. They were going to tear it apart and then turn en masse on Lakhesis. As the strike cruiser drew closer, they\u2019d start firing on it too, but the bulk of their assault would be focused on the closest threat first.", "Whoever or whatever was in command aboard that vessel didn\u2019t try to run. Instead, they moved to meet the oncoming Compact command cruiser. Grace sucked in a breath. She\u2019d pulled some ballsy tactics of her own when she\u2019d had to, but putting yourself in energy range of a Compact warship was one she\u2019d have had to think especially hard about. But before she could dwell more on what the unknown was doing or thinking, the missile cruiser\u2019s fusillade closed into interception range. Lakhesis\u2019s counter-missiles flashed from racks and launchers,  and the battle was well and truly joined.", "\u201cPush through it,\u201d she softly urged Leah. \u201cWe can do this.\u201d There were people that they had to save\u2026", "...and it was time for her poison tree to grow.", "~", "It was over.", "At least, Keating thought it was. Vegvisir\u2019s sensors were almost completely blind, the cruiser\u2019s hull pitted, rent and badly scored by the aliens\u2019 Prophet-damned energy weapons. He was mildly surprised that they were still in one piece; while his weapons had pierced the aliens\u2019 thick armour, the Exploration Fleet cruiser might as well have not had any itself. Vegvisir had been hit so hard and so fast by so many disparate weapons that its adaptive protocols had almost been completely useless. On a Home Fleet ship, things might have been different\u2026 but this wasn\u2019t a Home Fleet ship.", "Casualties\u2026 Prophet\u2019s Grace, be kind to us. From the damage they\u2019d taken, at least a quarter of his crew were dead and that was only the initial estimate. As sections reported in and the wounded succumbed to their injuries that number was only going to rise. From what he was sensing, best-case losses would be a third of his people. There was shipwide systems damage, the link was in tatters or down completely across multiple sections, the outer decks were badly irradiated\u2026 the tally just kept going.", "This was not the voyage he\u2019d hoped for, nor the kind of command he\u2019d wanted. They\u2019d won, though. At least, he assumed so. That Vegvisir was still intact and functional was the only sign of success he had at this point. Observer was trying to get his attention for damage reports, but he ignored those for the moment. Pryor \u2013 if Pryor was even still alive, Engineering had been hit hard \u2013 and his people were on it. He needed to know what was happening outside his ship before he could spare the time to know what was going on inside it. \u201cSensors,\u201d he said, coughing. There was a trickle of smoke in command. Several of the Compact cruiser\u2019s volleys had punched through the main hull and inflicted heavy internal damage. \u201cGive me a status report.\u201d", "\u201cNot reading any nearby ships,\u201d the officer quickly reported. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d", "Obed nodded. Vegvisir\u2019s sensors were so badly damaged that looking out the window might be a better option right now. \u201cI know,\u201d he told the younger man. \u201cBut I need something.\u201d He needed to know what was happening beyond his hull. The last thing Vegvisir had seen had been the incandescent death of their target as the cruiser\u2019s beams had cored through its hull and torn its reactor open. There\u2019d still been two Compact ships operational at that point, though\u2026 and the Triquetrans\u2019 apparent saviour. ", "\u201cI think\u2026 I think there\u2019s something moving,\u201d Sensors said, quickly recanting his earlier statement. \u201cI\u2026 yes. Yes, it\u2019s a drive wake. Moving towards us, definitely.\u201d", "\u201cAnalyzing\u2026 confirmed,\u201d Observer noted. \u201cPattern does not match those from the Compact vessels. I believe this is the newcomer.\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019re coming in see what\u2019s left of us,\u201d Oksana guessed. ", "\u201cDo you think\u2026?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not Riding Hood,\u201d Keating said. \u201cToo small. But\u2026\u201d he left the question hanging. The sudden reprieve had been as welcome as it was surprising. Obed had done what he could to make the most of it, but right now Vegvisir couldn\u2019t fight its way out of a wet paper bag. If this newcomer, whoever they were, decided that the League cruiser was less an ally and more something to exploit\u2026 he wasn\u2019t sure, though. They did come to our aid. Why would they bother doing that if they just wanted to kill the Compact ships?", "Maybe, just maybe Oksana\u2019s optimism had been on the ball\u2026 but right now there was a wide gulf between those possibilities. Obed leaned over the computer station, watching the flickering static-filled input from a sensor network filled with irradiated, compromised and outright destroyed nodes. The contact was coming closer. At four hundred thousand kilometers distance, it turned and started to orbit Vegvisir, eyeing the stricken Triquetran League vessel watchfully.", "There was the ping of an incoming transmission. \u201cThey\u2019re hailing us,\u201d Communications said.", "Obed looked at Oksana, then back to his comm officer. \u201cPlay it,\u201d he ordered.", "The transmission was voice-only and in Compact Standard. It was direct and to the point: \u201cIdentify yourself.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re fine, thanks for asking,\u201d Oksana muttered as she took a damage report from a yeoman. Her features tightened as she looked over it.", "Keating held up a finger. \u201cEasy, commander,\u201d he cautioned. He couldn\u2019t blame her too much, though. Vegvisir was hurt, thousands of people were dead or dying. It was easy to be a little short in these circumstances.", "\u201cSorry, sir.\u201d", "He gave her a nod. \u201cCommunications,\u201d he told the officer. \u201cLet\u2019s answer our, ah, helpers. This is Captain Obed Keating of the Triquetran League Naval Ship Vegvisir. Thank you for your assistance. To whom am I speaking?\u201d He paused, then spoke the key phrase. \u201cFirst, De Vries. Second, Jameson. Third, Proctor. Fourth, te Neu. Then fifth.\u201d", "There was a long pause before the newcomer spoke again. The same voice, curt and demanding. \u201cVegvisir, open visual communications.\u201d", "Obed and Oksana shared a quick glance. They both remembered a similar request and the identity of those who\u2019d made it. He nodded to his communications officer. \u201cDo it.\u201d", "~", "\u201c-Keating of the Triquetran League Naval Ship Vegvisir,\u201d a voice answered Cerulean Two\u2019s demand for the identity of the unknown vessel. ", "Grace froze. That was a human name. A human who\u2019d identified themselves as \u2018captain\u2019. That title was archaic and barely used on Rally, let alone anywhere else in the galaxy! That\u2026 \u201cThis is impossible,\u201d she finally said. \u201cThey can\u2019t be human.\u201d They couldn\u2019t. The names they\u2019d given\u2026 those were her and the other defectors. Nobody could know that. Only the AIs back in Zerzura had that information. She\u2019d caught the missing name. Alan Turmetsky. The youngest of them\u2026 and the first to die. Her thoughts were racing.", "\u201cVoice analysis suggests they are\u2026 though it is a small sampling,\u201d Leah put in. \u201cTriquetra and vegvisir are also terms with roots in pre-Fall Earth cultures.\u201d", "Grace\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cThey are?\u201d She was still trying to re-learn everything she could about true human history, but there was so much of it.", "\u201cYes. Did you want the full cultural contexts?\u201d", "\u201cNot right now, thank you.\u201d Grace slumped back in the command chair. Human. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible,\u201d she repeated, but despite her disbelief, there was the smallest glimmer of hope at the chance. Could it be? What\u2026 what if they are? But how? Expatriates from Rally? No, she\u2019d have heard of them. Red would have heard of them. Then who? How? Splinters from the Rally evacuation fleet? Other survivors of the Compact\u2019s genocide? How could those be possible? They couldn\u2019t. She was shaking, rattled to her core \u2013 maybe even more than the day Red had first spoken to her.", "Allyria stepped down from her position behind Tactical, putting a hand on Grace\u2019s shoulder. \u201cTell them to switch to a visual feed,\u201d she suggested. \u201cLeah can tell the difference between a screen filter and an actual image.\u201d", "\u201cWithin an acceptable margin for error, when accounting for an unknown comm protocol and network.\u201d the AI noted. \u201cEspecially if we are within real-time range.\u201d", "Grace took a breath, held it and finally let it out, squeezing Allyria\u2019s hand back. The shivering stopped. She was glad to have her here. \u201cMove us in,\u201d she ordered. \u201cLeah\u2026 tell them to do it.\u201d She let out another breath. \u201cIf they won\u2019t, or if they\u2019re using a filter to hide what they are\u2026\u201d Her fingers tightened around one of Allyria\u2019s. \u201cLeave them intact enough to be boarded.\u201d If this is a lie or some kind of sick game, I want to know who\u2019d do it, and I want them to pay for it.", "Lakhesis obliged, sliding closer to the heavily damaged \u2018Triquetran League\u2019 cruiser. It was a long, pale spar of a ship, its hull cratered and rent. It had taken a severe pounding, but it was still in one piece. The response from Vegvisir came after only a few seconds, a video feed seemingly straight from the vessel\u2019s own bridge. There were more than a dozen humans there, each of them wearing uniforms that Grace didn\u2019t recognize. The deck itself didn\u2019t have a trace of Compact or Principality architecture, nor even the smallest indication that this room hadn\u2019t been built by humans for humans. That might not mean anything, though\u2026 or it might.", "Grace thumbed the channel open. Lakhesis wasn\u2019t sharing their own imagery and all the \u2018League\u2019s\u2019 people had to go on from them was Leah\u2019s, and now Grace\u2019s voice. \u201cDo you speak English?\u201d she asked in that same language. It had been the primary dialect of the Confederacy, but for centuries it never been taught on Rally except as an eclectic curiousity. After Grace\u2019s defection she\u2019d had to learn it for herself; all of Bequeathed\u2019s defectors had. Allyria could also speak Rylean, her own mother tongue.", "As she spoke, a dark-skinned man with a close-shaven hairline blinked in surprise. He was standing in front of Vegvisir\u2019s command chair, and his uniform seemed to have the most ornate rank symbols. The man in charge, then. \u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019m Captain Obed Keating,\u201d he introduced himself. \u201cMyself and every man and woman aboard the TLNS Vegvisir are grateful for your assistance.\u201d Each vowel was stretched out slightly; \u2018cahptaihn ohbehd keahtihng\u2019.

He didn\u2019t know what he was holding and he didn\u2019t care. He\u2019d tried other means of contact, but none of them had worked. It had taken him several more rounds of drinks to get some useful information out of Ilthaonav. \u201cShut-ins need things too,\u201d the Prolocutor had laughed as he\u2019d filled his cup on Liam\u2019s coin. \u201cHow do you think she gets those, boy?\u201d", "How, indeed.", "He\u2019d found the service that his quarry used and for a moderate commission, he got a heads-up for the next delivery. Then he\u2019d bribed the courier to let him take the package himself. On most other worlds and citadels, that would have meant a quick dismissal for the deliveryman and a lawsuit for the company, but here on Approsa, such \u201clost\u201d packages were much more common. In time, corporate responsibility and a worker\u2019s sense of duty might outweigh the value of a credit chit or cash in hand, but not yet. A small transfer of money and a promise to see the package to its destination got it marked down as \u2018delivered\u2019, and if it didn\u2019t make it then that was the customer\u2019s business.", "Liam kept a careful eye on his surroundings. He carried a flickerknife on his hip, and that only because members of client races weren\u2019t permitted to have firearms here on Approsa. He still had his sidearm from his service aboard Unmistakable Threat Display, but that was back in his quarters. If he was caught with it, that would be a problem. One that might even end with him taking the starlight express.", "This section of the drift was old and worn down. Originally a centuries-old passenger liner that had ferried in illegal colonists and \u201cvolunteer\u201d workers to help keep the Unbound operations in the system running, its generations-obsolete shock drive had finally given out and stranded it here. It hadn\u2019t been worth salvaging, so the vessel had been stripped of anything remotely valuable and its plundered hull had become part of Approsa Drift. ", "As the citadel grew, adding proper habitat modules (and more than a few other wrecks), the inhabitants of better means and fortunes had moved from this area into the newer, nicer and larger rooms that became available. These days, only the bottom-most rungs of the drift\u2019s populace made this place their home. Addicts and homeless sprawled in the corridors, or squatted in apartments that they\u2019d managed to take over, while those that still owned their own small slice of property on the rusting, neglected decks watched Redfeather pass with furtive eyes from behind viewing slits and door cams. The odour of various narcotics wafted through the hallways; mess halls, technical substations and rec decks had been turned into flophouses and drug dens that the wretched forgotten members of the drift frequented. ", "Liam could feel the inhabitants\u2019 attention on him. Those that were still conscious, at least. Suspicion, veiled hostility \u2013 even some curiousity. Not many people had ever seen a Broken, let alone in person. Even after working Approsa for as long as he had, he still ran across those who didn\u2019t even know what species he was. He didn\u2019t trust that curiousity, though. Not here.", "Approsa was never \u2018safe\u2019, but these decks were worse than anywhere else. This was a place where you could get stabbed just for looking at the wrong person the wrong way, for the money some junkie thought you might have, just to see what colour a Broken bled or  for no reason at all. Part of Liam knew this was crazy. He should just drop the box, turn around and head back to the more \u2018civilized\u2019 parts of the drift (where you\u2019d only get stabbed for saying the wrong thing), find Theina, get drunk and laugh about how stupid this all was. What was he doing? He couldn\u2019t turn around, though.", "But he had to know. Someone else had survived the Ghost. He had their name. Emet\u2019pa, formerly a scopes officer aboard the Unfortunate Visitation. He knew that ship. It had worked in and around Approsa for years, until one day it had departed on a simple supply run and never come back. That wasn\u2019t too unusual. The life of the Unbound was even more hazardous than that of a normal spacer \u2013 Unfortunate Visitation could have been intercepted by the Space Force, attacked by rivals or even just reassigned on a whim by its clan\u2019s leadership.", "There\u2019d been stories, though \u2013 stories that that ship\u2019s name had been portentous, and in the worst way. It was said that Unfortunate Visitation had seen the Ghost, a claim its leader had vehemently denied, up until the day he disappeared along with his ship. That was all the confirmation that the old storytellers and rumourmongers needed, but nothing had ever been proven. Liam had never believed in those tall tales. No one sensible did, and he still wasn\u2019t sure he did. But... but he\u2019d seen the Ghost. Even if it was nothing but superstition, it was superstition that everyone else here believed. ", "He had to know more. He had to find out what had happened. What was responsible for the loss of Unmistakable Threat Display and why his life had taken the turn that it did. Maybe this was a nothing lead and he was just being played for a fool by the old Prolocutor. But maybe... maybe this was something.", "The man reached his destination, a suite at the end of a long corridor. None of the locals had bothered him. He knew how to hold himself and how to stay alert in a way that discouraged the station\u2019s predators. They looked for easy marks, not a fight that could go sideways on them. Taking a quick look around to confirm he was alone and it was safe to turn his back to the hallway, Liam pressed the buzzer. \u201cPackage delivery,\u201d he announced. He\u2019d gone through all this just to talk to her. Ilthaonav had said that she\u2019d never speak to him; so far the old spacer had been right. Guests weren\u2019t welcome here. Neither were inquiries, but Liam needed a way to get his foot in the door \u2013 figuratively and literally.", "\u201cPlace it in the receptacle,\u201d the suite\u2019s occupant said. There was a clunk as a panel in the wall opened.", "\u201cBefore I do that,\u201d Liam said. \u201cI was hoping we could talk.\u201d", "There was a brief pause. \u201cPlace the package in the receptacle.\u201d", "\u201cThis is Liam. Liam Redfeather. I tried to comm you. I left messages.\u201d Several times. He\u2019d never gotten any response.", "The panel clicked shut. \u201cGo away.\u201d", "\u201cPlease. I know \u2013 I mean, I got your name from... that\u2019s not important. But I want to talk you about the Ghost.\u201d", "Another pause, this one slightly shorter. \u201cGo away.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve seen it too! Please, I heard \u2013 I heard you\u2019ve seen it.\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t see anything. I don\u2019t know anything. I never saw it. Go away, Broken.\u201d", "\u201cYou have,\u201d he insisted, despite wondering if all he was doing was harassing some random shut-in. \u201cThe quartermaster from Evidence of Ruin told me about you. He said you\u2019ve seen the Ghost. That you\u2019ve escaped the curse.\u201d", "There was a sound from the other side of the door. Liam thought it might have been laughter, but whatever it was, it didn\u2019t sound amused. He waited, but there was no further response. He leaned forward, pressing his head against the door. \u201cPlease,\u201d he begged. \u201cPlease tell me that that\u2019s true. I\u2019ve seen it. I saw what it did to my ship, my crew. I... need to know what it is. I need to understand.\u201d", "No answer. He probably was just chasing varak. He was about to turn to leave, but an impulse struck him.   He pressed the comm one last time. \u201cIt was silver,\u201d he began. \u201cSo shiny that it was like someone had polished a mirror, all that silver almost drowned out by the reflection of the planet\u2019s clouds on its hull. It had arches, spires and curved spines. It didn\u2019t look like it was built, did it? It looked like it was born. And it sang...\u201d he tried, but was unable to suppress a shudder of revulsion of the memory of that transmission. \u201cIt sounded like every underworld ever had opened up and all their souls were calling to you.\u201d", "Clunk.", "Liam looked up. The panel had opened again.", "\u201cPut the package inside the receptacle,\u201d the voice told him.", "He did so. It slid back into the wall. Then, with a series of clicks and thunks of multiple disengaging locks, the door in front of him opened.", "~", "Emp\u2019ta was an older Thoughtful woman, just past middle age. She wore a grey pantsuit interwoven with small iridescent threads to make it shimmer slightly when the light hit it. Her quarters were immaculate, and larger than expected \u2013 it looked like she\u2019d taken out one of the adjoining walls, spilling over into the next set of quarters. Large screens had been hung on the bulkheads to give the impression of windows that looked out over a stony, arid vista of cliffs with a sky more green than any Liam remembered from Rally, making the suite seem less claustrophobic.", "Liam was offered a chair. Emp\u2019ta was nearly seven feet tall and as long-limbed as all her people, so the man\u2019s feet dangled off the ground like a child sitting in an adult\u2019s seat. She brewed herself some tea, offering her guest filtered water, which he accepted. Thoughtful tea was not lethal to Broken, but if you were foolish enough to drink it, you\u2019d spend several hours with one orifice or another positioned over a toilet wishing that it was.", "\u201cSo,\u201d Emp\u2019ta began as she sat across from Liam, crossing her long legs as she sipped from her mug. \u201cYou are Lucky.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s what they call me,\u201d Liam admitted. \u201cBut if I can ask...\u201d", "\u201cHow did I know?\u201d Emp\u2019ta took another brief drink. \u201cI may not have left my quarters in seven years, but I still have connections.\u201d", "Redfeather blinked. \u201cSeven- seven years?\u201d He looked around, seeing the woman\u2019s domicile in a new light.", "She blinked slowly in confirmation. \u201cI haven\u2019t left the station in ten. Every since the Visitation\u2019s...\u201d she made a series of clicks, her people\u2019s equivalent of a chuckle. \u201cWell, encounter.\u201d ", "\u201cI\u2019ve only ever heard rumours of Unfortunate Visitation. If I can ask..\u201d", "\u201cWhat happened?\u201d", "He nodded. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d", "She let out a long breath, looking past Liam to one of the viewscreens as if she were staring out a window in thought. \u201cIt was shipboard night. There were only four of us on command for that shift. We were doing a meteorological survey of Semtillian, a bit of commission work that Leader Balon picked up.\u201d The human nodded again. It wasn\u2019t unheard-of for otherwise legitimate organizations to use data from Unbound who\u2019d travelled to places that law-abiding people weren\u2019t supposed to go. Some would even hire those ships and crews for that very reason, keeping their hands clean. Performing a weather survey of a prohibited gas world might not be the first thing people thought of when it came to how Unbound earned money, but it was an easy way to make a few extra credits. ", "\u201cIt started simple and routine. Then we crossed the horizon and moved out of line-of-sight to the rest of the ships and drifts. Maybe it was waiting for us to do that, but I think \u2013 I think \u2013 it was just laying there and we disturbed it.\u201d Emp\u2019ta click-giggled again. \u201cIn the end, I suppose it doesn\u2019t matter. One of our probes... we sent it down the eye of a planet-sized storm near the southern pole. There was some kind of distortion in the cloud layers, almost like the residue of a drive wake, so Icmal \u2013 he was standing in The Pulpit at the time \u2013 gave the order to have our probe follow the trail. I thought it was stupid. That trail went into the storm\u2019s boundary. The turbulence would be dangerous to any ship and it was definitely going to cost us that probe. He insisted, though. So we did it. We sent the probe in. It lasted a little longer than we thought it would. Too long, in fact.\u201d", "She closed her eyes, revisiting what she\u2019d seen that day. \u201cWe got a reading. We followed it. If only that damn probe had fallen apart, but...\u201d The Thoughtful sighed. \u201cWe saw it. Surrounded by ball lightning the size of moonlets and half-hidden in clouds of methane and hydrogen, we saw it.\u201d", "\u201cThe Ghost.\u201d", "The woman\u2019s eyes blinked asynchronously in annoyance. \u201cYes,\u201d she said patronizingly. \u201cThe Ghost.\u201d She looked away again. \u201cBy the time we realized what was on our scopes, we\u2019d all seen it. Icmal ordered the connection to the probe severed. We didn\u2019t even try to retrieve it, just cut all functions and let it drop like a stone. We didn\u2019t think it had seen us. It didn\u2019t react, but later... later...\u201d she seemed to retreat into herself. \u201cWe told the leader. Balon ordered all augur data scrubbed from the records, even going so far as to physically purge those databanks. At the time, I thought it was excessive, but Balon had always been superstitious. Tribunes usually are, I suppose. They say they\u2019ve given up old myths and falsehoods, but show me a Tribune who doesn\u2019t tiptoe around their \u2018lady Fortune\u2019 and...\u201d Emp\u2019ta trailed off, realizing she was getting off topic. \u201cHe told us never to breathe a word of what happened. Not to anyone, not even to each other.\u201d Another series of clicks. \u201cIt didn\u2019t help. It knew. It knew we saw it, and it wasn\u2019t happy.\u201d", "\u201cHow?\u201d Liam asked. \u201cIf it didn\u2019t see you...\u201d The way Emp\u2019ta was talking about it was closer to some kind of mystical creature than not, an attitude he wouldn\u2019t have expected from a Thoughtful.", "Emp\u2019ta hesitated a moment. \u201cThere is no such thing as magic,\u201d she told him as if she could read his thoughts. \u201cThe supernatural and metaphysical are simply terms we apply to that which we have not yet fully understood. Nothing the Ghost has done has been beyond what technology can accomplish. A stealthed scope platform positioned over the planet to monitor traffic, a careful interrogation of our vessel\u2019s databanks for duty rosters and personnel assignments. Those are not outside the bounds of what we can do today. I know this, but it is still tempting to give in to primeval doubt and foolish supposition.\u201d She was quiet for several moments, drinking more of her tea. \u201cThere is comfort in knowing that you are not pursued by a fantasy or wraith, but by a tangible thing that must interact with the world as you do. At least, to a degree.\u201d", "Before Liam could say anything, Emp\u2019ta continued. \u201cKivis Mau-jind was the first. He quickly found a berth on a new ship, one leaving Approsa. His shuttle disappeared en route to the rendezvous.\u201d ", "\u201cNo one saw anything?\u201d", "\u201cNothing. The shuttle was on flight control\u2019s scopes one moment and then,\u201d Emp\u2019ta made a cutting gesture with her left forefinger, \u201cit wasn\u2019t. No debris was ever found, nor any trace of Kivis or the other fourteen souls aboard that craft. It took Kivis... and them along with him.\u201d", "Liam swallowed. He took a quick drink to quell the sudden dryness in his mouth. You\u2019re already marked \u2013 don\u2019t try to take anyone else with you. He remembered those words. The Ghost always claims its due, Broken, and when your time comes, it won\u2019t care if you\u2019re alone or not.", "\u201cAfter that,\u201d Emp\u2019ta continued, \u201cBalon threw the rest off us off of Unfortunate Visitation. He didn\u2019t phrase it that way, of course. He said there was work to be done for our syndicate here on the drift. I still don\u2019t know if he was trying to protect us or himself.\u201d Another giggle. Liam began to have concerns about his hostess\u2019s mental well-being. \u201cNot that it mattered in the end, I suppose.\u201d", "Liam didn\u2019t know how to respond to that. \u201cWhat...\u201d he began, his voice catching. He took another drink. \u201cWhat, ah, happened next?\u201d", "\u201cIcmal.\u201d Emp\u2019ta told him. \u201cHe was next. We thought we were safe here, you understand. This drift isn\u2019t particularly large or well-defended, but it does have a lot of eyes and a lot of augurs. The Ghost could never get near it without being seen. We thought that was enough and we felt safe here, not paying any attention to the rumours or whispers around us. We would do our work and occasionally meet up, but we would never talk about that day. Not in any meaningful way. None of us ever said the word \u2018Ghost\u2019, but just like Balon, it didn\u2019t help us, either. Perhaps if we\u2019d listened, if we\u2019d taken the time to understand, then we might have known...\u201d", "\u201cKnow what?\u201d", "Emp\u2019ta smiled at Liam. Despite their height and unsettingly long limbs, Thoughtful were not the first species anyone thought when it came to physical intimidation. And yet the expression on the woman\u2019s face was perhaps one of the most disconcerting things that the human had ever witnessed. \u201cThis station is haunted.\u201d", "Liam blinked. \u201cHaunted?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t mean in the figurative sense, Broken. Not in the vein of specters or phantasms, but I believe \u2013 I know \u2013 that there are things on this station. I don\u2019t speak of vermin, animals slipping through quarantine and certainly not the sapient wreckage outside my door. There are things, Broken. Brought aboard by unsuspecting ships like parasites wriggling from one host to the next. They\u2019re here. Dwelling in this place where no one sees, watching us and waiting...\u201d", "The first thing that Liam wanted to say was that\u2019s impossible. He\u2019d been hoping for... well, he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d been hoping for with this meeting, really. To know more. To understand the curse he was under and why his life had fallen apart. Instead, he was getting more stories and fearmongering. He didn\u2019t say any of that. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d", "\u201cIcmal,\u201d was the Thoughtful\u2019s answer. \u201cI told you \u2013 we let our guard down. Weeks became months and then years. We started to believe we were safe. One night after we\u2019d had dinner together, he was headed home. He turned down a corridor. I realized I had his comm. Seerie and I went after him... and the hall was empty. One of the vents was open. There was a little bit of blood. No more than two or three droplets and a full-grown Prolocutor was gone. No trace of him was ever found. No lurking wastrel could have done it. Not even a full-grown Serpent maiden could have spirited Icmal away in those seconds. It could, though. It reached out... and it took him.\u201d", "Liam felt a chill run down his spine. That\u2019s impossible. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re here,\u201d he said. Even this citadel isn\u2019t safe... but how reliable was Emp\u2019ta\u2019s testimony? It was tempting to fall down the well of jumping at shadows, but...", "...but she believes this enough to lock herself in her quarters for the better part of a decade. How\u2019s that for fearmongering, \u2018Lucky\u2019?", "The woman tilted her head in acknowledgement. \u201cI scrubbed my records from the station\u2019s network. I changed my name to Emp\u2019ta and took a new job. I moved to here. I let who I was before fade away and soon people believed that she\u2019d been taken by the Ghost as well. A few remember me. Ilthaonav is one of them. He must have pitied you an awful lot to give you my name.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re not angry?\u201d", "\u201cI am, but it does me no good.\u201d She giggled. \u201cNot that it\u2019s changed anything.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "\u201cSeerie couldn\u2019t take it,\u201d she said, ignoring Liam\u2019s question. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t live like this. It wasn\u2019t even a year before...\u201d she hesitated. \u201cI was told that she killed herself, but I wonder...\u201d The Thoughtful looked away again. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that some of those who\u2019ve seen the Ghost just give up. They give themselves to it, taking a ship to Semtillian. Maybe she did something similar. Maybe she just stepped outside her quarters, knowing what was waiting for her.\u201d", "The Thoughtful took a larger drought from her mug. \u201cYes, waiting. That\u2019s what I mean, Broken. I don\u2019t know how long I fooled it, but it knows I\u2019m here. Perhaps it was Micqua. I haven\u2019t heard from him in years. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d prefer that he\u2019d betrayed me or not. If he did, it would mean he was still alive. If not... then it probably pried what it wanted out of him...\u201d she sighed sadly. \u201cI hear them sometimes, you know. Scratching at the door, or skittering through the air vents. The things the Ghost has put aboard this station.\u201d Seeing the expression on his face, Emp\u2019ta laughed. \u201cGive me credit, Broken \u2013 I know what duct vermin and beggars at my door sound like and I know the noises it makes.\u201d", "Liam was silent for a moment, the coldness in his spine getting sharper. What the woman was describing sounded more like cabin fever and paranoia, but he didn\u2019t contradict her. She was scared, scared enough to seal herself in these quarters for seven years. He looked over his shoulder. Aside from the multiple locks, the door had been heavily reinforced. It would take dedicated cutting tools to burn through it, and all the vents were likewise protected, even if they weren\u2019t already too small for a body to be pulled through. If something wanted in, it would take a lot of effort and draw a lot of attention. \u201cI see.\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me,\u201d Emp\u2019ta said with a thin-lipped smile. \u201cYou will. When it starts reaching out.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "\u201cI told you,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cThis citadel is haunted. Not just its halls or the ships, but its systems and networks. It already knows you, Broken. It will try to trick you, lure you to it and if it can\u2019t... it will reach out like it did with Icmal. I\u2019m safe in here, but you... well.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cBroken never listen, do they?\u201d", "\u201cWe listen,\u201d Liam protested. \u201cWe do.\u201d", "\u201cDo you?\u201d Emp\u2019ta chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard everything I\u2019ve said, true \u2013 but did you listen? Or are you trying to rationalize and justify the words of a Thoughtful as nothing but stress and paranoia.\u201d She smiled, her thin lips drawing up. \u201cI\u2019m not unfamiliar with your species, and your face isn\u2019t as hard to read as you think. I\u2019ve spent a decade studying it. Every scrap of data, every story and every rumour.\u201d She gestured to a bank of computers in one corner. \u201cI know more about it than anyone else still alive.  I know enough to know that there is no escape. Only survival.\u201d", "\u201cSomeone must have gotten away,\u201d he protested. \u201cIt\u2019s been decades and there\u2019s been \u2013 there\u2019s been dozens of people who\u2019ve seen it. They \u2013 they can\u2019t all have died.\u201d", "\u201cNo, not at all. Most are simply classified as \u2018missing\u2019.\u201d Emp\u2019ta finished the last of her tea, setting the cup down on the small table between them. \u201cDays, weeks, months... years,\u201d she said that with a sad smile. \u201cIt always finds you.\u201d Another unsettling laugh. \u201cWhat are you thinking, Broken? Perhaps you\u2019ll find a berth on a powerful vessel, something that can protect you? Perhaps like Unmistakable Threat Display. Or maybe you\u2019ll jump aboard a starship about to leave the system, like Unfortunate Visitation?\u201d She tut-tutted like only a Thoughtful could. \u201cWhat plan do you have that anyone else hasn\u2019t already devised and that it hasn\u2019t already seen?\u201d", "\u201cSo... so what? I should lock myself in my quarters and just stay there for years? Like you have?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m still alive,\u201d Emp\u2019ta pointed out. \u201cIs anyone else who saw it here to tell you about it?\u201d She blinked; first her left eye and then her right. \u201cNo. No, they are not.\u201d She stood, gesturing back to her door. \u201cIf all you\u2019re going to do is clutch to denial and delusion, then there\u2019s nothing I can do for you, Broken.\u201d", "It was a mistake coming here, Liam thought sourly. He fluctuated between terror at Emp\u2019ta\u2019s certainty and disbelief at what she\u2019d told him. He\u2019d hoped to find out something... he wasn\u2019t sure what, only that he\u2019d hoped it would be something more useful than locking himself in his room for years. Even if he wanted to, he couldn\u2019t. He needed to work. He needed to take care of Theina and he couldn\u2019t do that by cowering in their apartment day after day. \u201cThank you for your time,\u201d he said as he was led to the door.", "Before the Thoughtful opened it, she placed a hand on his shoulder. \u201cTell yourself you\u2019re safe here aboard the citadel. Tell yourself all the little things that will happen are nothing but coincidence and correlation. Tell yourself whatever lies you like for as long as you like. That\u2019s what the four of us did and now there\u2019s only me. It is here, Broken. It has been here for a very long time, and whatever else it is or is not, it does not like to be seen. It does not forgive that, and it surely does not forget.\u201d", "~", "Though her shift should have ended an hour ago, Liam got home before Theina. He\u2019d expected that he would. A freighter with a large crew of Didacts had docked with the drift earlier this morning, so as a Didact hostess here on the citadel, she\u2019d almost certainly be \u2018working\u2019 late. He didn\u2019t think about that. It was just one of the things that he tried to ignore. It was usually easier to do so, but ever since the Ghost, everything was just piling up, getting louder inside his head.", "Making dinner was a distraction, and one he was glad to have. Their quarters had a small, cramped kitchen for which Liam was extremely grateful; many of Approsa Drift\u2019s lower classes had to make do with shared commissaries and even lavatories. ", "Liam had some stir-fry on the oven; something like rice mixed with vegetables and nuts. Didacts and humans didn\u2019t have extremely different dietary needs \u2013 with a few supplements, boosters and the occasional bout of irritable bowels, Liam could make do with Theina\u2019s fare. He was the only human in Approsa, so getting fresh foodstuffs for himself was both difficult and expensive. He could use a synthesized menu, but even synth-foods for species that were far more widespread than Broken were described as lacking flavour and texture. The synthesized cuisine intended for his species was a fine example of that, especially since the menu for Broken was only a percentage was what available to other species, and most of the former had been adjusted from examples of the latter digestible to humans. As a result, flavour, texture, appearance and occasionally digestibility were perennial problems with Broken-safe synth-foods.", "As a case in point, Liam had made himself some synthesized chicken \u2013 more accurately a lump of human-digestible animal protein that someone, somewhere had fleetingly imagined to taste somewhat like chicken \u2013 as a side dish. Didacts were herbivores. They could have small amounts of animal protein (real or synthetic), but not too much.", "The door chime sounded and despite himself, Liam flinched. He checked the security cam, but it was just Theina. He unlocked the door, letting her inside. She trudged into their quarters, moving like each of her limbs had been tied to cement blocks. Her clothes were creased, her fur matted and sticky in places. She stunk like sweat, alcohol, narcotics and other substances that Liam knew, but couldn\u2019t let himself dwell on or else he\u2019d make himself crazy. \u201cWelcome back,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t ask how her day had been. He knew better.", "She made a soft ffft of acknowledgement, but didn\u2019t meet his eyes. She went into the shower and stayed there for a very long time. When she came out, her fur was clean, smelling of flowery shampoo and soap. He held out a chair at the table for her. They ate dinner and never talked about her work. He made small talk about his own job and that he\u2019d gone to meet Emp\u2019ta.", "Theina\u2019s ears perked up at that. Her nose and whiskers twitched in concern, but he assured her that it had been safe. \u201cWhat was she like?\u201d she asked.", "He thought for a moment, remembering the reinforced door, the quarters with the viewscreens to let the Thoughtful pretend she wasn\u2019t in a cage of her own making. That was what it had taken to survive the Ghost. \u201cBroken,\u201d he admitted at last. ", "Theina reached across the table, taking one of his hands in hers. \u201cHey,\u201d she told him, smiling. There was sadness in her brown eyes. She was worried. No, not just worried \u2013 afraid. \u201cIt will be all right. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s stories, right? Just stories. You\u2019re here on the drift with me. Don\u2019t listen to what anyone else says. You\u2019re here, I\u2019m here and we\u2019re safe, right?\u201d", "\u201cYeah,\u201d he agreed. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He told her that, but he wasn\u2019t sure who the lie was for. Her... or him.", "She was quiet for a few moments. \u201cI almost have enough,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt would just be a little more and we could buy out our contracts and go somewhere else.\u201d", "Liam blinked. She had that much? He felt his guts tighten. She had to be skimming her tips to have saved so much so quickly. \u201cTheina...\u201d he started. \u201cBaby...\u201d", "She pulled her hand back. \u201cDon\u2019t say it.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d", "\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d", "He couldn\u2019t leave it alone, though. \u201cI know,\u201d he told her softly. \u201cI know what you have to do and I know you want out of this life, but you can\u2019t... you can\u2019t short the house. That\u2019s not something they look past. Even when I was on Unmistakable Threat Display, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything if you got caught.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to.\u201d", "\u201cIf you can almost buy out both our contracts, then you have enough to cover yours. Do it, okay? First thing tomorrow, just go... just go and get it done. Get on the next transport and head home.\u201d", "Theina shook her head. \u201cNot without you. I won\u2019t leave you here.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not getting bought out,\u201d he told her. \u201cThe Claws want their money\u2019s worth from me, especially since-\u201d Since there\u2019s a ticking clock over my head. They want to squeeze everything they can from me before... well, before whatever happens, happens. \u201cSince I don\u2019t pilot any more. But you can.\u201d Working girls and boys were a dime a dozen to any syndicate. As long as Theina showed up with the money and nobody tripped to the fact that much of it was theirs to begin with, she\u2019d be free and clear. She should do that. He wished she would. She should get away from him and his bad luck, before anything happened to her as well.", "...but she was too loyal for that.", "\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere without you,\u201d Theina told him. They\u2019ll let you go. They will, if they think you\u2019re \u2018cursed\u2019. They won\u2019t turn down cash in hand over a...\u201d she licked her lips, remembering the old human phrase Liam had told her. \u201cA \u2018bad penny\u2019. We can leave together. You talked about Rally. We could go there. You always said you wanted to show me the ironwood forests.\u201d", "Don\u2019t try to take anyone else with you. Those words rang in his ears like a funeral dirge. \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he promised, reaching over and taking her hand again, looking into her soft brown eyes. \u201cBut promise me, okay? You\u2019ll think about going. I can save up, or wait until my contract is up for renewal. You don\u2019t have to stay on this station on account of me.\u201d", "She chittered sadly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you here all alone. I want to be with you. I can... I can handle it. I can wait, until we\u2019re both free.\u201d ", "\u201cYou\u2019ll think about it,\u201d he pressed. He didn\u2019t want her here if she didn\u2019t have to be. Not just because of the Ghost but for all the other reasons that neither of them talked about.", "Theina looked away. \u201cI will,\u201d she finally promised, but that was no more the truth than his own assurances that everything was fine. It was the lie both of them needed, though.", "\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cThink hard, okay? And one more thing, no matter what you decide \u2013 no more shorting the house, all right? I can wait. It\u2019s not worth the risk to you.\u201d", "\u201cThey haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d", "\u201cSo far. They will. Promise me, Theina. No more skim.\u201d", "She puffed up her cheeks and her tail lashed back and forth, but she finally looked back at him. \u201cNo more skim,\u201d she promised.", "He smiled, patting her hand. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay.\u201d They went back to their dinner and pretended that everything was the way they said it was, even though they both knew otherwise.", "~", "\u201cDo we have a problem, Lucky?\u201d Leader Unam Ikask Tort Lacn said after Liam had seated himself in the Tribune\u2019s office, the guttural question the only greeting the smaller man received. Liam wasn\u2019t sure why he\u2019d been summoned. Unam was in command of all the Proliferate Claws operations within Approsa, and for him to take a personal interest in a lowly cargo worker was either very bad, or very good... and from what Unam had just said, Liam didn\u2019t think this meeting was going to be the latter.", "\u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of, patron,\u201d he told the Tribune honestly. Not more than usual, at least.", "Unam\u2019s four eyes \u2013 the lower two were good quality prosthetics, almost indistinguishable from the real thing \u2013 stared back at the Broken sitting in front of him. \u201cYou sure about that?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t understand, patron.\u201d", "\u201cRrrrm,\u201d Unam rumbled as he pressed his palms together. \u201cI knew Thanto well. He was a good judge of character and he liked you. He could potential among even the lowest of sapients, and I never had a reason to doubt him before...\u201d Unam trailed off. \u201cInfoSec registered an unauthorized breach of our secure files last night. Specifically, our personnel records and specifically again, your service history. Someone seems very interested in you.\u201d", "Liam blinked in surprise.", "\u201cIt took a fair bit of skill to get through our firewalls as fast as they did,\u201d Unam continued. \u201cThere\u2019s not more than a few techs on this station that could do it and none of them are cheap. So my next question to you, \u2018Lucky\u2019 \u2013 who did you piss off this bad?\u201d", "\u201cI... I don\u2019t know,\u201d Redfeather replied. Someone had been looking into him? Who? Emp\u2019ta? She could have asked him anything, and she could have used her contacts for anything else. No, this had to be someone else \u2013 but why, though? There wasn\u2019t anything special about him. He didn\u2019t have any insight or access into the Proliferate Claws\u2019 inner workings, so there was no reason to scrape his records. Unless... unless this wasn\u2019t about the Claws at all.", "Emp\u2019ta had told him how she and the other crew from Unfortunate Visitation had had their information uncovered. The Thoughtful\u2019s cautionary words echoed in his head.", "This station is haunted.", "\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything, patron,\u201d he added, hoping that this was all a mistake or usual Unbound business. He didn\u2019t want to think about the alternative, no matter how much he knew it was likely to be true. \u201cI do my work on the docks and mind myself.\u201d", "\u201cNow that,\u201d Unam said, pointing one slender finger at the seated Broken, \u201cisn\u2019t quite accurate, is it? I heard you\u2019d been going around to shuttles and ships looking for someone to take you out and when that didn\u2019t work, you tracked down Evidence of Ruin\u2019s quartermaster.\u201d He put both hands on the back of his chair, looking down at Liam. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to ask you again, Redfeather: do we have a problem?\u201d", "\u201cI.... No, patron. No problems. I promise.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. I\u2019ve had more than a few of my subordinates telling me to cut you loose or settle the curse ourselves.\u201d Liam swallowed. He\u2019d expected the former, but \u2018settling the curse\u2019 was a diplomatic way of talking about killing him before the Ghost did. \u201cOut of respect for Thanto and what he did for the Proliferate Claws, I haven\u2019t listened yet. In fact, I think I\u2019ve been generous. I let you work and live here with the rest of us despite you having the ghost\u2019s kiss. I\u2019m letting you draw a salary. I\u2019m even letting you stay with one of our clubs\u2019 earners and risking her alongside you.\u201d", "\u201cYes and- and I appreciate all that, patron. I do.\u201d It hadn\u2019t even occurred to him that they might take Theina away. He\u2019d always known they could, of course. The syndicate could do pretty much anything with their own people, but it wasn\u2019t mercurial in its actions.", "\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that, but that generosity, you see... that\u2019s contingent on there not being any trouble,\u201d he stressed that word. \u201cThe Proliferate Claws don\u2019t need trouble and I certainly don\u2019t either. So as long as you\u2019re not going to bring problems into my office, I can continue being generous up until I don\u2019t have to be.\u201d Until I\u2019m dead, Liam mentally translated. \u201cBut if you start causing issues and trouble, then I\u2019m going to have to revisit this arrangement. You understand all that, Broken?\u201d", "\u201cYes, patron. Completely.\u201d", "\u201cGood. Watch your back, Redfeather. You\u2019ve got more enemies than you think you do.\u201d", "Some of his own co-workers were doubtless among them. \u201cYes, patron. Thank you. If I may ask, though \u2013 did InfoSec track the breach?\u201d", "Unam\u2019s jaws parted in a Tribune\u2019s nod. \u201cYes. It was a dead-end. The terminal the intruder used was down in the Stacs, so it must have been a relay from another point.\u201d", "The Stacs were a collection of protrusions that stuck down from Approsa Drift\u2019s underside, towers and spires that bore a passing resemblance to a collection of stalactites. Several years ago, there\u2019d been a terrible radiation disaster and most of the Stacs had been thoroughly poisoned. No one wanted to spend the time, money or effort to decontaminate them and to this day they remained inhospitable, the area deadly even to the hardiest of organic species. No one would have gone there just to use a terminal, but using one as a relay from another point in the station... that was possible, but it didn\u2019t feel right.", "\u201cI see. Thank you, patron.\u201d", "Unam grunted. \u201cBack to work, Redfeather. Before you start shedding over my office. Hard enough to keep things clean around here.\u201d", "Liam tilted his head in acknowledge of his leader\u2019s dismissal and took his leave. His mind was racing, and something cold and heavy had just formed in the base of his guts. Someone was looking into him. Someone was looking for him.", "It will reach out...", "~", "Liam woke up in a cold sweat. The dreams again. The Ghost\u2019s song, the screams of Semtillian and all its dead. This time, he was looking through the wreckage. This time, he saw Theina\u2019s body floating amongst the ruin of Unmistakable Threat Display, her lifeless eyes staring at him. He had to assure himself that she was still with him. She was there next to him, like she always was. As he stirred, she murmured softly, but he hadn\u2019t woken her. He took a drink from the water on his nightstand, wiping the perspiration off his brow and neck. The melody started to fade, but he could never forget that sound, more then he could forget that day. He wanted to. He wanted so badly to pretend that everything was fine... but he couldn\u2019t. He could feel it, he thought. His luck was running out, dribbling away like water down the drain, day by day.", "A blinking light caught his attention. His comm had a new text message. He picked it up, half-expecting a message from his shift supervisor or one of his co-workers telling him he\u2019d forgotten something or screwed up (at least as they saw it) again. Instead...", "The sender ID was garbled, a string of nonsense that didn\u2019t match anywhere on the station. Below... Liam\u2019s breath caught in his throat. It was data from his personnel file and with it was another message, short but broken and distorted as if it were corrupted or had been run through software incompatible with the rest of the drift.", "# I #### SE", "E ### YO", "U ##", "He stared for what seemed like an eternity, but couldn\u2019t have been more than a second or two. Before he could even begin to process the message, his screen blurred, flickered and then went back to his mailbox. There was no sign of the message he\u2019d just seen. He frantically scrolled through the archives and deleted records, but... it was gone. If it had been there at all. He was still half-asleep and the half of him that was awake was recovering from a panic attack. Someone had gotten into his files and that was the message that the Ghost had sent him. Fertile ground for paranoia.", "Just a hallucination. That was it. He was just cracking up. Liam wasn\u2019t sure if that was better or not. It probably wasn\u2019t.", "He didn\u2019t get back to sleep that night, holding onto his comm and staring at it, afraid of what else he might see.", "~", "Liam tried to tell himself that what was happening wasn\u2019t happening. That it was someone messing with him and his increasing sense of paranoia. Someone looking into him \u2013 that was odd, but it wasn\u2019t impossible. And a message that might not even existed to begin with... even if it did it was an old, old hacker\u2019s trick to scrub something from someone else\u2019s inbox. He\u2019d reported everything about his encounter to his superiors. Someone could have got that information and decided to fuck with him outside of work hours. There was nothing magical or supernatural about those incidents, just like Emp\u2019ta said.", "So he continued as if things were indeed fine. He didn\u2019t stir up any more \u2018trouble\u2019 as Unam would have called it. He didn\u2019t bother anyone else for information or favours, he left Ilthaonav alone. He wasn\u2019t looking for anything to do with the Ghost. Days passed, and he started to believe that things might be okay. That he\u2019d been getting too much inside his own head, wrapped up in stories and rumours. So every time that that insistent little voice inside him reminded him about Unmistakable Threat Display and all the friends he\u2019d lost aboard it, he found a new way to silence it. Every time the memories got too loud, he\u2019d turn up his white noise generator to drown them out. Every time he woke up from the dreams, he\u2019d reach for the pills he got from a dealer. Every time part of him insisted that he couldn\u2019t just ignore this like he\u2019d done with everything else in his life, he told that part of him to shut the fuck up. It was working. He went on like he always did and things were fine.", "Then it tried to take him.", "He\u2019d been working in the outer docks at the time. There were some maintenance issues in the section and he\u2019d been told to look into them. It was scut work that an engineering drone could have handled, but drones were more valuable than a Broken\u2019s time. This particular bay was currently empty; it lay along Approsa Drift\u2019s underside, with several cargo airlocks spaced out across the floor, outlined in warning yellows and golds, waiting for small to mid-size vessels to dock with them and offload their freight up into the citadel.", "Gantries lay retracted against the walls and ceilings, turning what otherwise might have been a cluttered, busy chamber filled with work crews, overseers, cargo pallets and service machines into a vast, open space of nothing, scarcely lit by running lights and floor panels. With no vessels to service, the bay\u2019s environmentals were turned down to minimum, making its atmopshere just this side of tolerable to Liam. Adding to that was the temperature: so close to outside, the bay was cool as the warmth of the citadel leaked through the hull and radiated out into space. A drone wouldn\u2019t have cared. But then again, a drone would be given more important things to do.", "So, wearing an ill-fitting EVA suit with his helmet mag-locked to his waist, Liam spent the day scuttling through chilly conduits and arm-deep in abandoned varak nests that hadn\u2019t been cleared out in months. A good number of the troubles here were caused by the filthy little vermin gnawing through cables and circuitry and their caustic waste damaging sensitive equipment inside the bulkheads. ", "At least Liam didn\u2019t have to deal with the spitting, shitting little monsters. He was grateful for that at first, then started to wonder about it. Varak would abandon nests, but some of these looked freshly-made. Why would they up and leave them? He didn\u2019t wait too long for an answer; as he scuttled through the ducts, he froze as he caught sight of dozens of tiny, beady eyes glaring at him. He raised his lamp, catching a huge knot of the disgusting vermin, piled on top of one another. They\u2019d slithered out of their nests and into the vents. They hissed and snapped at him. He flipped them off, wishing he had a flamer.", "As he continued on his way, they screeched and fled deeper into the citadel. Liam frowned. Varak would run from larger animals, but they could also be notoriously aggressive in defence of their nests. They wouldn\u2019t have abandoned those because of him and certainly wouldn\u2019t have fled once he started to move away from them. The hairs on the back of his neck stiffened.", "He paused in his tracks, listening to his surroundings. At first all he heard was the constant, faint background humming of machinery, the rattle of air vents and the faint whine of ill-serviced gravity plating. There didn\u2019t seem to be- wait. ", "His breath caught in his throat. From elsewhere in the network of tunnels and ducts, he could hear something else moving through the vents. It didn\u2019t sound as large as a person, but it certainly wasn\u2019tvarak sized. ", "It could be anything, he told himself to calm the sudden spike of adrenalin. As the varak proved, lots of things could get onto a citadel. Few of them were any real threat to the inhabitants. Seven months ago, a prize meral had escaped from its owner and run rampant through the vents until it had been captured again and there\u2019d been rumours of a giant galli serpent dwelling in the sewage systems for as long as Liam had been on the drift. Even beyond organic causes, it could be a malfunctioning service drone, a spy device left by a clan to monitor traffic here or far more mundane explanations. There was nothing inherently concerning about a random noise in the ducts.", "He repeated that to himself that until his heartbeat slowed and he went back to work. Still, he kept looking over his shoulder and froze every time he heard something he couldn\u2019t immediately identify. He kept hearing the noise. Sometimes it came towards him, but never so near that he might catch sight of it. Eventually, he stopped hearing it at all and though he tried, he never felt ", "Finally, his shift wrapped up. Liam put his tools away and headed back, glad to be done. His skin hadn\u2019t stopped crawling since he\u2019d gotten here. He was hearing things, he was certain of it. Just pests scuttling through the vents, making him jumpy. As he approached the doors, they slid open and another figure came though. Liam recognized him. A Pentitent; Ulash Uten Umaeni. He was as low on the totem pole as Lucky himself and made up for that be being as much of an asshole to those he deemed beneath him as he could. His people might have betrayed the Compact and been stripped of their ruling status for their crimes, but at least they weren\u2019t Broken.", "His glassy addict\u2019s eyes narrowed at seeing Liam. \u201cI\u2019m not going to have to double-check your work am I, Lucky?\u201d", "\u201cI know how to do my job,\u201d the human replied to the greasy-skinned alien, stopping a few feet in front of the cargo airlock that lay between him and the exit. Probably better than you do, you fucking junkie.", "\u201cNot from what I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Ulash sneered.", "\u201cI was a pilot and technical specialist, not a dockworker.\u201d", "\u201cAnd you were probably just as competent there, too. If Leader Thanto hadn\u2019t thought you were a good luck charm, you wouldn\u2019t even have been that \u2013 and we all know how that worked in the end... don\u2019t we Lucky.\u201d Ulash stepped into the bay. \u201cShow me what you were working on. I\u2019m not getting shat on for what you should have done.\u201d", "\u201cFine,\u201d Liam rolled his eyes. He wanted out of this dock, but humouring Umaeni was the easiest way to get out of here. Then the tika-huffing bastard couldn\u2019t blame any of his screw-ups on Redfeather. He jerked a thumb back to his last work site. \u201cRight over here, Uten.\u201d Using a Penitent\u2019s middle name by itself was as much an insult as the way the other man used Liam\u2019s own nickname.", "The alien glared, but came forward anyways. He stepped onto the closed airlock doors, walking across them as if they were as reliable and sturdy as the drift\u2019s own deck. Which they should have been, but to the surprise of both dockworkers, they opened just as Umaeni reached the midpoint. With a puff of frigid air and the soft rumble of internal mechanisms, they parted.", "The airlock doors were almost three meters to a side and just as heavy as they looked, but they moved as easily as a flat stone sliding across a frozen pond. The Penitent yelped in surprise, putting a foot down on nothing as the deck beneath his feet abruptly disappeared. He grabbed at the retreating panel, but missed and tumbled down into the airlock, crashing against the outer doors. \u201cAgggh,\u201d he swore. \u201cTriachs piss on you, Broken! You think that\u2019s funny?!\u201d He looked down and his eyes widened, clutching at his left shin. It was bent at an angle that had nothing to do with the Penitent\u2019s backwards knees. \u201cMy leg! You worthless urethral dripping, you broke my leg!\u201d", "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me!\u201d Liam shouted back, about to climb down into the airlock. \u201cJust stay there, I\u2019ll come get-\u201d He didn\u2019t even have time to finish the sentence. With a throbbing alert that made his teeth ache, the upper doors began to close. Liam ducked back just in time to prevent his own legs from being caught and crushed between the closing panels. Before he could even process that, the alarm changed timbre. Liam\u2019s head came up. Shit! He knew that sound.", "The outer doors were going to open, and the airlock was depressurizing. No... he realized quickly as he glanced over the readouts. The air in the airlock wasn\u2019t being drawn out like it should have been. When those doors opened, the atmosphere purge would blow Ulash out into space.", "Liam scrambled over to the control panel, but neither the keys nor the screen itself responded to the man\u2019s attempts to stop the purge sequence. Cursing, he pulled the panel off the manual override, grabbing the lever in a bid to pump the inner doors open. Once they did, the safeties would kick in and the outer doors would stay closed. He pulled on the lever as hard as he could, expecting to feel it draw back and the inner doors to start ratcheting open. It didn\u2019t move. He pulled on it again. Nothing. He looked down and froze.", "The manual override had been sabotaged. The lever was damaged, its base melted and disfigured. Those fucking varak, he thought angrily.  He tugged on it harder, but he couldn\u2019t budge it even an inch. A Worker or Tribune might have been able to, but neither of them were here.", "The airlock intercom was still working. He slapped it. \u201cPut your helmet on!\u201d he shouted at Ulash. \u201cI can\u2019t stop the sequence! Get your helmet on!\u201d He pulled out his personal comm next, calling up dock control. \u201cAlert!\u201d he shouted, hoping that the Penitent had a good seal on his suit. \u201cCode Seventeen-Nine, section Eighty-Three Brillisc!\u201d", "Thankfully Umaeni listened to Liam, getting his helmet on with several seconds to spare before the outer doors opened. The atmosphere howled out of the chamber, rushing through the crack in the doors. There wasn\u2019t a lot in the airlock and it emptied weill before the doors were fully open, but the brief gale still threw Ulash back against them. The Penitent hadn\u2019t turned his comm on, but Liam could see his lips moving and suspected the alien was cursing him emphatically. At least he wasn\u2019t going anywhere. At a Rally-normal atmosphere, air evacuated from from a breach at forty klicks an hour. Even in a suit, if you hit something at that speed, it could kill you.", "As the doors finished opening and the starfield shone in, the other man drifted there, staring up at Liam through the windows. He raised his hands to make an obscene gesture towards the human. He never finished.", "A set of three cords, none of them any thicker than two of Liam\u2019s fingers, reached out from around the left side of the airlock and wrapped around Umaeni\u2019s neck, right arm and waist. His eyes widened. He opened his mouth to scream and then, just as quick as a snap of Liam\u2019s fingers, the other man was pulled out of sight. Liam tried to raise him, but there was only dead air. He tried other frequencies, but Ulash wasn\u2019t on any of the Claws\u2019 frequencies. He was just... gone.", "Frozen in place, Liam stared through the airlock\u2019s window and into the void beyond. Among all the shining lights in the endless black of space was the gleam of distant Semtillian, gazing back at him like an eye shining in the darkness.", "I see you.", "~", "The EVA rescue teams had been scrambled, but at first they were in no hurry. Umaeni was still in his suit, so it wasn\u2019t like he was in any real danger \u2013 the most injury he\u2019d suffer was to his pride, since tripping an airlock cycle was the kind of thing new meat did. It was also a way of putting team members in their place. A \u2018friendly\u2019 reminder that you weren\u2019t popular and if anything serious happened, you\u2019d be looking for the shiftmates that you were pissing off to help you out. Killing someone by spacing them was only doled out by the upper echelons on the drift. It had a nice, innocuous name, too. It wasn\u2019t \u2018being spaced\u2019, no. Instead, you were \u2018transferred off-station via starlight express\u2019. ", "Liam hadn\u2019t been airlocked \u2013 yet. Either that was because the rest of the crew didn\u2019t actually think that poorly of him, or none of them wanted to be bothered to \u2018rescue\u2019 him and give him the false impression that he could count on them. He knew which one of the two was more likely. ", "Ulash wasn\u2019t that much more popular and at first, the rescue teams treated the whole situation like a joke. Liam tried to impress on the first responders the need for urgency. Eventually he got through to them and hurried to get out there, but they didn\u2019t believe his report. They thought Umaeni had just been blown into space. Broken intellectual acumen was questionable at best, especially during times of stress. Even if Liam had seen something, it was probably just debris that the other man had been thrown into and he bounced off it. That was reasonable. Logical. Overwhelmingly likely, even. But it wasn\u2019t what happened.", "Liam had seen it with his own eyes. Those cords \u2013 those tendrils \u2013 had reached out and wrapped around Ulash like they\u2019d been waiting for him. And they had, the human realized with a thrill of horror. The airlock hadn\u2019t malfunctioned. The inner doors had opened when the Penitent was right in the middle of them. The control panel and the override... varak couldn\u2019t damaged either of those that badly. They\u2019d been sabotaged.", "I was supposed to be the one in that airlock. It was meant for me, waiting for me to walk over it on my way out of the bay. It... It... ", "It was the Ghost. Emp\u2019ta had been right; there was something from it on this citadel and it had just tried to kill him. No... not something. Somethings. Whatever had been outside the station and whatever had compromised the airlock. The noises he\u2019d heard in the bay... had someone or something been stalking him, planning on killing him then and there and deciding on an \u2018accident\u2019 instead? Or had that always been the plan \u2013 just another disappearance to add to the Ghost\u2019s tally? Something that could be chalked up to his own incompetence and safely ignored like everything else?", "They never found Ulash\u2019s body. They did find his helmet, though. Empty, with the neck seal sliced clean through, like someone had slipped a scalpel through the weave, cutting all around it and popping it off like the top of a ration can. There was blood on the inside. Maybe it hadn\u2019t been sliced off, someone had wondered aloud. Maybe it had been sliced through. No one had commented on that.", "The official cause of the accident was quickly determined to be \u2018airlock systems malfunction\u2019 and \u2018suit damage caused by debris\u2019. The issues with the airlock\u2019s controls were written off as caused by varak and that was that. As far as the higher-ups were concerned, the incident was closed. It wasn\u2019t, though. ", "After that, even the few friends Liam had had on the docks stopped talking to him. The others didn\u2019t even bother hassling him now. He got ugly, hostile looks instead. Despite the official report, they knew. None of them wanted to be anywhere near him. They either thought he\u2019d missed the damage to the airlock and his incompetence got Ulash killed or... or it was the curse. His curse, and its body count had started.", "This time, he couldn\u2019t even disagree. It knew who he was. It knew where he was. It was going to keep coming, just like it had with every other poor, damned soul who\u2019d ever laid eyes upon it. ", "Unless...", "Unless he did something about it.", "~", "\u201cSo you came back,\u201d Emp\u2019ta said as she let Liam back into her quarters. \u201cIt\u2019s started, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d", "\u201cI... I think it has,\u201d he admitted dourly, politely ignoring that she\u2019d opened the door with a pistol in one hand \u201cBut it could-\u201d", "\u201cIt could be something else, is that what you were going to say?\u201d the Thoughtful interrupted as she secured the locks, sealing her quarters again. She chuckled; rather than the clicking this time, it was a piping sound. \u201cWords and theories I\u2019ve heard before, Lucky. Words and theories I\u2019ve had myself. I argued with myself about coincidences and misplaced pattern recognition, about observer bias and emotional lensing. And where did all of that lead me to? Three dead friends and this room.\u201d She walked past him, holstering the pistol and seating herself. \u201cWhere has it led you?\u201d she asked.", "\u201cHere,\u201d Liam replied. \u201cBack here.\u201d", "\u201cAnd why?\u201d She seemed genuinely curious in the answer.", "Liam took a breath. I have to know. \u201cI have to know,\u201d he voiced the thought aloud. I... I\u2019ve gone my entire life just keeping my head down, doing what was expected of me. Not this time. I can\u2019t. I saw my ship die. My superiors just want to bury it. Thousands of people gone and they want to pretend like it never happened. Everyone here does. But I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t. There\u2019s something in this system. Something on this station, and it\u2019s coming for me.\u201d He looked up at her. \u201cYou said you know more about the Ghost \u2013 about it \u2013 than anyone else. Tell me. Tell me what\u2019s out there.\u201d", "Emp\u2019ta was silent for several moments, but then the Thoughtful finally nodded. \u201cVery well,\u201d she agreed at last. \u201cCome with me,\u201d she told him, leading the human into her offices. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll see if you can learn as well as listen.\u201d"]}

Enjoy!", "In this chapter: RSVP / word gets around / metaphor and madness", "Coming up: alien contact / arrival / you must be", "My website, patreon/subscribestar", "~", "Chapter 11:", "Kebrak Daun looked somewhat reduced from the last time Adrianna had seen it. Its sprawling shipyards were largely empty, and the berths that were full were either tending to the remnants of Wraith Fleet Severance, or laying down new hulls as quickly as possible. During Operation Hatchling, the Argosy forces had suffered casualties that by any normal metric were catastrophic. Only the fact that they\u2019d inflicted even greater losses upon the Compact prevented the Battle of Galhemna from being a humiliating defeat.", "Leblanc circled the bridge of her command ship, Eisheth. It was one of the Red Hand\u2019s \u2018kiran shren\u2019, purpose-built warships by the Red Hand themselves. Eisheth was the largest of these, a boxy, hammer-headed pocket battleship. It had no sense of elegance or aesthetic quality and it was purely, unapologetically functional in design. The very thing that an insurgency with limited funds would construct. Unbound clans weren\u2019t nations; operating even a handful of capital ships, let alone building them, cut deeply into their operating costs.", "Most criminal syndicates that carried out piracy and commerce raiding relied on captured or converted civilian vessels for their combat needs \u2013 Q-ships, corvettes, militia or mercenary frigates. A few might have some repurposed Compact warships and though their crews would tell bloody tales of the ship\u2019s taking and their personal bravery, the overwhelming majority of these vessels were stolen from salvage yards, purchased from corrupt reclamation facilities, or salvaged from ancient battlefields. Bribing or coercing some bureaucrat into letting you make off with a borderline obsolete, stripped-out hulk didn\u2019t quite have the same ring to it, though.", "In contrast to their peers among the fringe, the Red Hand frequently took warships from their foes, claiming prizes from mercenary clans sent to hunt them down, corporate-run \u2018security fleets\u2019, minor planetary militias and rarely (but more often than the Compact would ever admit) from the Space Force itself. Adrianna smiled at that reminiscence.", "It was bad enough to lose to an Unbound, but also to a Broken and to have your ship taken from you and used to swell your enemy\u2019s ranks. She\u2019d heard it said that any Space Force leader who let his vessel be taken by the Red Hand and found his way back to his nation would wish that he\u2019d died at the rebels\u2019 hands. She didn\u2019t know how true those rumours were, but she knew that the Compact had indeed executed more than one leader who\u2019d surrendered to her. It was rare that the Compact took out its wounded pride upon its own people, though: in at least one of those instances, the leader in question had compounded gross incompetence with cowardice in the face of the enemy.", "Regardless of the reason, she\u2019d shed no tears for fools and oppressors who escaped death at her hands only to receive it from their own nation; indeed, she enjoyed the irony.", "\u201cMajesty.\u201d Drexil said, interrupting her thoughts as her sigil leader approached her dais. \u201cWe\u2019ve received confirmation to come in-system and an approach vector to follow.\u201d A strange, six-limbed cross between arthropod and mammal, Drexil\u2019s people had a pseudo-exoskeleton that made them appear like grotesque and misshapen skeletons whose bones had been stripped of all flesh and stained an unhealthy brown. With their dark, sunken eyes and sharp, clicking mouthparts, they made passable stand-ins for undead horrors that had been patched together from several different species.", "Once known as Ennoblers and exalted for their faith and support of the Compact, Drexil\u2019s species were now known as Mortificants, cast down after an attempted coup of the Inner Council and the Triarchs themselves. Adrianna had wondered what the Compact would look like had the Ennoblers succeeded. Probably not that much different, really. Unlike the Penitents, a similarly fallen species, the Mortificants\u2019 dispute with the Compact had not been one of methodology and morality, but of who got to be in charge. Even in their current positions, Mortificants still held other client races in contempt and deeply resented the ruling species for passing this judgment upon them, \u2018lowering\u2019 them to the level of primitives and uncivilized beasts. Drexil did not share those opinions. He\u2019d served the Red Hand for three decades, starting off as a minor officer aboard a simple commerce raider, until his skill and tactical instincts had brought him to the attention of the Red Queen herself.", "Adrianna nodded. \u201cAcknowledge their transmission and confirm to our escorts to wait for us. Helm, update our course with the provided vector and take us in.\u201d Though it wasn\u2019t a stranger to the fortress system, Eisheth wasn\u2019t normally allowed in-system. Normally any meetings took place well outside the system proper, where it was easier to cover up the pocket battleship\u2019s presence. Now that the Principality had been shown to the entire galaxy to be working with the Red Hand, such precautions were no longer necessary. The cat was out of the bag, so to speak.", "The woman felt her lips twitch in sad amusement. She hadn\u2019t seen a cat in more than sixty years. When she\u2019d lived on Rally, she\u2019d owned a soft, old sweetheart of a tomcat called Lanks that she\u2019d raised from a kitten. She\u2019d never seen him again after she\u2019d been arrested for killing Commissioner Sath. When the police broke down the door and barrelled in to her family home, he\u2019d panicked and run away. Her parents told her they were able to find him... but they\u2019d never had pictures to prove it. She remembered spending nights with Lanks cuddled in her arms, purring loudly... and then waking her by batting her in the face until she got up to feed him.", "She let the wistful sense of nostalgia pass over her. She hadn\u2019t been that girl in a very long time, nor had she been back to the world of her birth since the day she\u2019d escaped from prison and smuggled herself off-planet. Through her network of contacts and informants she kept up to date on what was happening back home, but the Red Hand rarely operated openly in and around Rally, for the same reason that Red One avoided the system: it denied the Compact excuses to bear down on the human population.", "There were still occasional outbursts among the less-indoctrinated segments of Rally\u2019s population, including a small but significant groundswell of support from the Verrisha living there. Sadly, most of the humans who waved placards or vandalized Compact installations on Rally with red handprints were more enamoured with the idea of the Red Hand than the reality of it. The work Adrianna and her people did was bloody, grinding and often horrific. She was grateful for any support at all and every affirmation that the Compact hadn\u2019t truly ground their \u2018Broken\u2019 down into obedient pets truly did warm her heart, but she wondered how many of the young men and women she saw on news reports actually could do what she did. Too few, but then not everyone could be a revolutionary.", "Or a terrorist, she thought. That was how the Compact saw her. Some days, she didn\u2019t even disagree. The Principality\u2019s media was kinder, usually referring to the Red Hand as insurgents and rebels but that was only because the Red Hand rarely struck at their territory. Rarely, though; not never. Noble Fleet Lord Jirrico\u2019s nephew had been killed attempting to defend a Principality convoy that Red Hand raiders had intended to pillage, souring the local relationship between them. The last two years had done much to repair that relationship. At least to some degree. Through Galhemna, Adrianna\u2019s forces had contributed to a massive win for the Askanj, but the cost of that victory wasn\u2019t going to be forgotten. Nor how she\u2019d baited the Principality into publicly supporting her people.", "Which brought her thoughts back full circle. Last week, she\u2019d received an urgent message from Jirrico. The Noble Fleet Lord was requesting an immediate meeting. He\u2019d been extremely close-lipped about the cause, but whatever it was, it had wound him up. His missive was just shy of being a summons, but at least the Askanj-anj had retained enough wherewithal to know how well that would have come across.", "Though it was a diversion she didn\u2019t need at the moment, Adrianna had accepted the Noble Fleet Lord\u2019s request to meet. It was the least that she could do for an ally, and he had been extremely accommodating in the past. If I can siphon off ships and war material to that odious bitch Keru\u2019sa to help keep my good friends off my back, I can take some time to see what\u2019s crawled up Jirrico\u2019s ass.", "Bringing herself into a Principality fortress system might seem dubious, but Adrianna didn\u2019t believe this was a trap, though. Her contacts within the Argosy hadn\u2019t reported any shift in their policies towards the Red Hand, official or otherwise and with the losses Jirrico had suffered in Operation Hatchling, he needed the Red Hand to keep the Compact off-balance while he repaired and re-armed. Acting against the insurgents would be the worst thing he could do in these circumstances, but she didn\u2019t discount the possibility. Complacency, no matter how justified or well-reasoned, could get you killed.", "There had been some... rumblings from her agents deeper in Principality space that spoke at a sudden and substantial strategic change in the nigh-on forever war between the Askanj and the Compact. Very interesting rumblings indeed, coming from reliable sources on each side of the Principality-Compact conflict. She was awaiting confirmation, but passing messages across hundreds and thousands of light-years took time, especially when you were crossing an active war zone. Sometimes too much time, but there was no other alternative.", "Eisheth continued sunwards, leaving its escort flotilla back at the perimeter. This was the first time Adrianna had brought support into Kebrak Daun. Since it was the first \u2018official\u2019 meeting between Red Hand and the Askanj Argosy, she wanted to make an impression... and remind her allies of the power that the Red Hand commanded, even if their naval strength was as much reduced as Kebrak Daun. She still had enough ships to make an entrance. More than a dozen vassa anka and kiran shren held position outside Kebrak Daun\u2019s outermost defence lines, watching and being watched by an equal number of Argosy pickets. Eisheth was being led in-system by an honour guard \u2013 a pair of battlecruisers.", "A very nice touch, Adrianna surmised, with no little amusement. Jirrico understand the game as well as she did. They give me the \u2018respect\u2019 of this level of escort... and keep enough firepower on me as a warning. She smiled, continuing her circle of the command deck. It would be seven hours before her ship reached the designated coordinates, giving them plenty of time to sight-see. Kebrak Daun\u2019s garrison was a lot smaller than she remembered, but not quite as small as she\u2019d expected. There was a lot more activity in the system than the survivors of Hatchling and Kebrak Segment\u2019s own garrisons could account for. They\u2019d been reinforced. Not unexpected, but...", "I wonder just how much they\u2019ve been reinforced.", "She stopped by the master augur station. \u201cWhat are we seeing?\u201d she inquired, nodding towards the distant gleam of Kebrak itself.", "The scopes officer, a female Geonatal, turned from the brown and grey of Eisheth\u2019s bridge to a redder hue of slight frustration. \u201cThose heavy ECM networks are making it impossible to scan past the life zone, Majesty. There\u2019s nothing but static and white noise on scopes. Visual instrumentation is giving us more, but at these ranges, our resolution...\u201d she trailed off helplessly.", "\u201cDo what you can. I want to know who else is here.\u201d The Argosy had been breaking a lot of barriers with their latest generation of jamming and stealth technologies. Among their new toys were massive ECM arrays that could hide large swathes of a star system from long-range augurs. The installations were hundreds of kilometers across, with huge radial antennae extending out from a dreadnought-sized core and required a truly staggering amount of power to run, with multiple reactors as well as solar arrays beaming power to them directly from the system\u2019s primary. They also hampered friendly navigation and communications, but the only way to see what they were hiding was good old-fashioned telescopes and visual data, which was easier said than done.", "Whether they were worth the investment or not was yet to be determined; right now they were closer to proof of concept than working designs, but their presence in Kebrak Daun had helped conceal Hatchling\u2019s build-up from the Compact\u2019s reconnaissance. Adrianna surveyed the wall of static hashing up her long-range scopes. There was a pattern in the output and size of the jamming fields, hinting at the platforms\u2019 locations. Possibly useful, likely not. It wasn\u2019t like she was planning on taking them out and even if she was, the platforms would have defences to prevent them from being sniped by railfire and long-range missiles.", "But what about a few hellebore impactors? she wondered to herself, toying with the idea. Galhemna had been the first time she\u2019d seen Nemesis in action, and the AI dreadnought was been everything she\u2019d believed her to be. Red One wasn\u2019t any more likely to lay siege to Kebrak Daun than Adrianna herself was, though. Probably. There was still the Betrosha Nebula incident, but by and large the Principality\u2019s official policy on Nemesis was to ignore her, letting her focus all her hostility upon the Compact.", "\u201cYes, Majesty. I\u2019ll do everything I can to get you that data.\u201d", "\u201cI know you will. Keep at it, submissive.\u201d", "Drexil looked over at her. \u201cYou think Kebrak Daun has been reinforced.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m certain of it. The Principality\u2019s starved for hulls, but they can\u2019t allow Kebrak Daun to remained this vulnerable for long. The only questions are what they\u2019ve gotten...\u201d And who they\u2019re expecting to fight. The Compact was in no position to press the assault right now, but the Argosy might not be worrying about them.", "Maybe that\u2019s what this was about. Jirrico, his fellow nobles in the Argosy and the Principality Parliament couldn\u2019t be happy at all about Echo and the additional ships Red One had shown up in Galhemna with... or the hundred-odd vessels she\u2019d stolen out from under the noses of the Space Force and Argosy alike. They wanted to know what Red One was doing or planned to do, and since Adrianna had come to them with her \u201cassociates\u201d Proctor and te Neu, they might be hoping that the Red Queen could provide some insight.", "How unfortunate that I\u2019ll have to disappoint them. Even if she knew what Red One was up to, Adrianna would never share that information with the Principality. She trusted the AI more than any other living being in the galaxy, and the Principality... well, there was a reason for what happened in Betrosha. So if Jirrico was hoping for Adrianna to be a right-thinking, AI-fearing friend to the Principality, he was going to leave this meeting unfulfilled.", "Besides, Adrianna thought with a mental chuckle. If he only knew... She was almost as much machine as woman now. Neither Compact nor Principality rejected cybernetic implants, improvements or prostheses... but they both held to a limit for how much of them you were allowed to have before you were less a person than a thing. In Leblanc\u2019s younger years, that had always been good for some existential dread, wondering if she was still Adrianna Leblanc or a program that imagined itself to be her, running on the wetware of a dead woman\u2019s body. God knew she\u2019d died often enough to raise those kinds of doubts.", "The last time she had met Red One in person, she\u2019d asked that question. You are Adrianna Melanie Leblanc, the AI had told her. Nothing less than that. The certainty in the AI\u2019s voice and the simplicity of her response had been oddly reassuring. Since then, whenever the niggling sense of worry about what Adrianna was crept up, she remembered those words.", "Today wasn\u2019t one of those days. Today, she was the Red Queen, warrior-monarch of the Red Hand on her way to meet one of her allies, to see what he wanted and hope he wasn\u2019t going to ask her to betray another.", "~", "Charles arrived home to find a Verrish sitting on his front steps. He recognized her; Millirysa se Lyu. She was one of Sharon\u2019s regulars. Like Allyria, Millirysa was Rylean, but she was small for her people; about nine inches shorter than Allyria and thinner in frame. The two Brutes had been friends, but not as close as Allyria and Grace. The doctor\u2019s lips twitched in a brief, sad smile remembering how inseparable that pair had been.", "\u201cHello, Millirysa,\u201d he said as he got out of the car, its door automatically closing behind him. \u201cDid you want to see Anna? She\u2019s working a shift at the clinic until 23.\u201d", "The young woman stood, dusting off her dark skirt. It was coated with a thin film of pollen and dust. She\u2019d probably been playing in the yard. It was often hard to keep a Verrish sitting still and Charles had learned to accept the claw marks in his trees. \u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d she said. \u201cI was actually hoping to talk to you.\u201d", "\u201cOh?\u201d Charles blinked in surprise as he approached the porch. \u201cWhat about?\u201d", "Millirysa opened her mouth slightly, running her tongue over the tips of her long canines. Her tintas flexed. \u201cCould we talk inside?\u201d", "\u201cOf course.\u201d Charles unlocked the door and deactivated the security system, taking off his shoes as his guest ducked under the doorway and entered the foyer. He hung his coat up on the rack. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d", "Millirysa hesitated, her pointed ears twitching and her head-tails splaying out in a way Charles recognized. She was nervous. \u201cWord has gotten around,\u201d she began. \u201cAbout the investigation. The one into the people who died on Bequeathed.\u201d", "The doctor unfastened his tie and put it over a coathook. \u201cI see.\u201d", "\u201cI heard what you said about Grace... and Allyria. I appreciate you standing up for her. Not many people would.\u201d", "\u201cIt was nothing, but if you don\u2019t mind my asking \u2013 how did you find out?\u201d The talking-to he\u2019d received was fresh in his mind. He hadn\u2019t known anyone else was following the investigation like he had been.", "Millirysa shrugged, rephrasing her earlier statement. \u201cWord gets around.\u201d", "Charles didn\u2019t say anything to that. He wasn\u2019t sure how anything from an official investigation \u2018got around\u2019, but he wasn\u2019t going to argue the point. He was already uncomfortable with the turn the conversation had taken. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, leading his guest into the sitting room. Most of the furniture was intended for humans, but there were a pair of chairs sized for Verrisha. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d", "The young woman sat down. She was still on edge. \u201cI just... wanted to thank you,\u201d she said. \u201cI know we don\u2019t have the best reputation on Rally. It\u2019s hard to find anyone who\u2019ll take us seriously. Even our own...\u201d she didn\u2019t say the words foster parents, but she didn\u2019t have to. Millirysa was a year younger than Allyria. Her fosters had been Joshua and Ivena Chen. The relationship between them and their Envoy Child had been... acrimonious, to say the least. That was a polite way of putting it. Charles didn\u2019t know the Chens like he did the Parkers, but he\u2019d heard things through the grapevine. Things like Joshua needing a hand transplant, and the time Ivena had worn a head wrap for several months after Millirysa had nearly taken half her scalp off.", "As unfortunate as it was, those weren\u2019t even the worst possible outcomes. Even a preteen Verrish was the size and strength of a human. Allyria had once picked up Steve Parker\u2019s favourite chair and thrown it through their bay window like it was nothing. Charles was acutely aware of just how dangerous the species was... but he\u2019d also come to see them in a different light than he once had.", "\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t,\u201d he finished the sentence for her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d", "Millirysa nodded. \u201cWhat you and your wife do... it means a lot. To all of us, I mean.\u201d", "Charles nodded. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it, but Anna\u2019s the one who does all the work. I just put in an appearance once in a while.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ve pushed your hospital to accept more of us as patients and you\u2019ve helped her get funding. The ECO used to be just a place they pushed us whenever our fosters got fed up with us, but it\u2019s... it\u2019s better now. We\u2019ve noticed.\u201d Charles offered his guest a glass of water. She accepted it and took a sip, looking at him over the rim. Her eyes were greener than Allyria\u2019s. \u201cHave you been following the investigation any further?\u201d", "Charles paused. There was something in Millirysa\u2019s voice... \u201cNo,\u201d he admitted at last. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. After that incident with the protest, I decided to leave things alone.\u201d He didn\u2019t say that it wasn\u2019t fully his idea. It would be inappropriate, but he had the sense that the young woman might already know his reasons.", "Millirysa chirred thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019ve heard,\u201d she said slowly, \u201csomething about the investigation.\u201d She left that hanging, looking to Proctor to see if he would take the bait.", "He mulled his response for a moment, remembering the discussion that he\u2019d had with Barnswell. He said he\u2019d leave things alone. He should. He shouldn\u2019t say anything else, shouldn\u2019t ask the question he was dying to ask. But he couldn\u2019t just let things alone. He\u2019d tried. He\u2019d been able to do it for weeks now, but this... this was about Grace. She was... she had been his daughter. He looked up at the pictures set on the mantle and took a slow breath. \u201cWhat,\u201d he asked, feeling as if he was stepping up to a door that he wasn\u2019t sure that he wanted to open, \u201chave you heard?\u201d", "The Verrish girl was silent for several seconds, watching Charles carefully. \u201cThis investigation hasn\u2019t come from where they told you,\u201d she said at last. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of double-checking old records and trying to tie up loose ends, or finding something from the initial incident that was missed. The push for this has come from off-world, and from high up.\u201d", "Charles blinked in surprise. That didn\u2019t make any sense. Why would anyone off of Rally care enough about the Bequeathed to push for a new investigation and delve into the victims\u2019 backgrounds? The loss of the cruiser was a tragedy, but he was self-aware enough to realize that the Compact was so massive that tragedies of that scale had to happen almost every day. Before he could let himself get side-tracked by that information, he looked over at Millirysa. She was still staring at him. If she\u2019d had a tail, it would have been twitching like a cat\u2019s. Completing the metaphor, he felt rather like a mouse.", "\u201cHow did you learn this?\u201d he asked.", "Millirysa shrugged again. \u201cWord gets around,\u201d she told him, the answer just as uninformative the third time around.", "Charles bit his lip. He didn\u2019t consider himself to be an unintelligent or naive man and the young woman\u2019s obfuscation was setting off an alarm bell in his mind, though he couldn\u2019t say what that might signify. \u201cI see.\u201d", "\u201cAllyria talked about you a lot,\u201d Millirysa continued. \u201cShe didn\u2019t like you much at first, but she changed her opinion. I liked Grace too, even if I thought she was a little...\u201d she stopped herself there, blushing and look away.", "\u201cA little...\u201d Charles prompted.", "\u201cNaive,\u201d Millirysa concluded with an apologetic flick of her tintas. \u201cBut sincere.\u201d Her head-tails twitched again. \u201cI miss them. You shouldn\u2019t have to worry about their memories being tarnished, but the Compact is looking for something with Bequeathed.\u201d", "\u201cA scapegoat,\u201d Charles guessed.", "Another of the girl\u2019s tintas flexed like an annoyed cat\u2019s tail. \u201cMaybe. But maybe something else, too.\u201d", "There was a long silence before Charles spoke again. \u201cHow do you know all this?\u201d", "\u201cWord-\u201d", "\u201c-gets around. So I\u2019ve heard.\u201d Charles sat in silent thought for several moments. \u201cThank you for coming, Millirysa,\u201d he said at last, standing up. \u201cI\u2019ll let Anna know you stopped by.\u201d", "The woman tilted her head in acknowledgement. She looked sad. Not, not entirely sad. Unhappy, certainly. Disappointed \u2013 that was it. He didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d been hoping for, but she clearly hadn\u2019t gotten it. \u201cThank you, doctor.\u201d She stood back up, almost a foot taller than Charles. \u201cI hope I haven\u2019t stepped out of place.\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d he assured her. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just...\u201d This entire conversation had made him uneasy. He escorted Millirysa to the door. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot to deal with. I know it\u2019s been two years, but...\u201d He opened the door for her. \u201cEvery day I have to remind myself that she\u2019s gone.\u201d He pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cAll of this has dredged up a lot of memories.\u201d", "She nodded. \u201cI understand. I\u2019m sorry if I bothered you.\u201d She pulled out her comm to call for a ride. \u201cAllyria and your daughter were good people, doctor. They don\u2019t deserve to have their names dragged through the mud.\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d he agreed. \u201cThey don\u2019t.\u201d Charles watched her step across the threshold. He didn\u2019t know what was going on, but there there was some kind of finality about this conversation, as if he\u2019d unwittingly closed the door that he\u2019d been standing in front of. He didn\u2019t know what that door was or what was behind it, but his intuition was telling him that he\u2019d never be able to open it again if he didn\u2019t do something.", "He remembered the smile on Barnswell\u2019s face as the CIS agent had spoken with him and told him to leave this alone... and he also remembered his daughter\u2019s smile. \u201cWait,\u201d he said, the words bolting up out of him before he could stop them.", "Millirysa paused, turning back to Charles. \u201cYes?\u201d", "\u201cDo... do you know why this investigation started?\u201d", "The Verrish shook her head. \u201cNo, not really.\u201d", "\u201cBut... if you did find out, if that \u2018got around\u2019...\u201d Charles swallowed. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate hearing it... or anything else.\u201d", "Millirysa smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do,\u201d she promised. \u201cAnd if you find out anything, I\u2019d like to hear it as well.\u201d", "\u201cOf course,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI think I can do that.\u201d Once Millirysa was gone, Charles replayed the conversation over in his head. The young woman had been circumspect, but there\u2019d been nothing really odd about what they\u2019d discussed.", "So why did it feel like he\u2019d done something wrong?", "~", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cI must have misheard you, because it sounds to me like you\u2019re upset that I reduced four Compact listening posts to craters and free-floating debris.\u201d", "\u201cNot \u2018upset\u2019, exactly,\u201d Jirrico clarified. \u201cLet us say... apprehensive.\u201d He was meeting with the Renegade monarch in his offices aboard Kebrak Daun\u2019s largest palisade, The Walls of Immet-Kryg. His desk was in the center of a large, round room with and mossy vines growing from a hydroponic gallery along the walls, their leaves and stems trimmed and clipped to prevent them from growing over the display screens, seating areas and liquid-metal data tanks that encircled the room. A pair of Legionnaires along with two of the Red Queen\u2019s Bloodsworn stood outside in the corridor. Jirrico was joined by his intelligence chief while his aide Ichit stood off to one side, the woman staying out of the conversation.", "The human made a sharp exhalation through her nostrils. \u201cOf course,\u201d she agreed. Even with her accent in All Common, the Askanj-anj could detect the sarcasm there. \u201cYou were so unbothered by my actions that you raced a message to me as fast as you could, bringing me here so that you could tell me how not upset you were.\u201d She canted her head towards the shorter man. \u201cI destroyed military installations that belonged to our mutual enemy, Noble Fleet Lord. I\u2019m not sure why that would make you \u2018apprehensive\u2019.\u201d", "Jirrico looked to Grand Vizier Suun Rin Tor, the Askanj-jelhan meeting his gaze evenly. Askanj-jelhan were a hermaphroditic, seven-limbed species; they possessed four arms and three legs \u2013 two for locomotion, while the third was smaller. It grew from the base of their spine and was used for balance and in mating. The species had frilled ears, a flat, wide mouth and two clusters of three eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s simply a new variable in our ongoing strategic equation,\u201d sie explained to their guest. \u201cOne that requires a certain degree of synchronicity in this current situation.\u201d", "\u201cOh,\u201d the human rolled the word down her tongue. \u201cI see.\u201d She paused. \u201cYou mean how the Compact\u2019s Age of Expansion seems to have abruptly stopped for you? Is that the situation you\u2019re referring to?\u201d", "Jirrico and Suun Rin Tor exchanged another look before sie spoke again. \u201cHow did you learn about that?\u201d", "The human tilted her head to one side, a gesture that would have been extremely uncomfortable for an Askanj-anj with an intact spinal column. \u201cMy hand reaches far,\u201d she said.", "\u201cAmusing, but not an answer,\u201d the Vizier noted.", "\u201cI suppose not. How\u2019s this, then: twenty thousand warships don\u2019t just stop advancing without a lot of people noticing and some of those people are my people.\u201d She did not, Jirrico noticed, say which side of the conflict \u2018her\u2019 people were on. Even for a Renegade cartel of their power, the Red Hand had the tendency of getting into places that they shouldn\u2019t. \u201cThe Compact hasn\u2019t made any statement, but they can\u2019t keep this a secret for long,\u201d the human continued. \u201cWhat\u2019s really interesting to me, though\u2026 the Principality hasn\u2019t made any official comments, either.\u201d Leblanc flashed her teeth. Despite being smaller and flatter than those of the carnivorous Askanj-illth, the gesture was no more reassuring. \u201cSo let\u2019s not beat around the bush. What is going on and why have you called me here?\u201d", "Jirrico\u2019s crests flushed and swelled slightly. \u201cThe answer to those questions is the same: the Pyre of Galhemna.\u201d", "One of the woman\u2019s blue eyebrows arched. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not happy about the outcome?\u201d", "\u201cIt was a strategic victory,\u201d Suun Rin Tor put in. \u201cAlbeit a costly one. The Compact was set to deliver a crippling blow to our support and resupply chains across multiple Segments and now their entire operational plan has been thrown into disarray. Both Parliament and the Fleet Nobility are very pleased about that.\u201d", "\u201cAnd yet, that\u2019s not the sense I\u2019m getting,\u201d the human observed. \u201cIf the Pyre caused the Compact so much upheaval that they\u2019ve had to re-organize their entire strategic stance, I\u2019d think you\u2019d be just as ecstatic as you say you are. In other circumstances, I\u2019d imagine that the reason you asked for this meeting was to coordinate a new offensive in the region \u2013 probably with that nice, shiny fleet you\u2019ve got hiding here around Kebrak Daun\u2019s inner worlds.\u201d", "Jirrico\u2019s expression tightened and he inhaled sharply. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d", "That smile widened. \u201cI guessed,\u201d the Renegade monarch confessed. \u201cYour jammers are covering the inner system, but you\u2019ve got more ships than I expected outside their range. Now, you could just have called in support from around the Segment and its neighbours, but some of those ships you\u2019ve got here\u2026 I don\u2019t know, call it professional paranoia.\u201d She circled around the room, stopping at one display tank in particular. \u201cPlus, the course you gave us \u2013 you were keeping a lot of terrain between Eisheth and the inner system. Something\u2019s down there that you didn\u2019t want us to notice. Put it all together and what else could that mean but a nice, shiny ghost fleet, probably rushed from whatever crisis point was recently freed up?\u201d", "From the faces of her hosts, her guess was probably on the mark. \u201cBut I\u2019m noticing a lack of cartwheels here and you haven\u2019t asked after my forces\u2019 disposition more than politeness has required.\u201d Her gaze locked onto Jirrico\u2019s face. \u201cYou were more concerned about my recent actions than my military strength. Whatever\u2019s disordered the Compact has had the same effect on you.\u201d She paused. \u201cHow am I doing so far?\u201d", "The Noble Fleet Lord pressed his hands together. He\u2019d long ago learned not to underestimate the Red Hand or its leader, but as Galhemna had proven, he could still find himself surprised by both. In the past, he had wondered what the galaxy would look like had the Compact assimilated the humans rather than breaking them, or what might have happened if his people had come to the fledging nation\u2019s aid \u2013 rather, if they could have made any difference if they did. What might have been. \u201cIt was Chrysalis,\u201d he put his annoyance to one side, confirming his guest\u2019s supposition. \u201cThat neverborn has a sibling and now a fleet.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Leblanc replied. Her tone became pleased, almost dreamlike. \u201cIsn\u2019t it wonderful?\u201d", "Suun Rin Tor made a strangled noise of disbelief. \u201cYou are not that naive, Red Queen.\u201d", "\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m seeing something that bleeds the Compact getting stronger and that makes me happy. It should make you happy, too.\u201d", "\u201cThis is very different than seeing one of the Compact\u2019s opponent rise in power,\u201d the Askanj-jelhan corrected. \u201cThis is a neverborn. You are fully aware what such monstrosities are capable of and you should not be sanguine about what this one is doing.\u201d", "The human bared her teeth even more. \u201cThat neverborn is a relic of my people\u2019s nation and it\u2019s aimed squarely at the Triarchs\u2019 hearts. I\u2019m counting on what it\u2019s \u2018capable of\u2019.\u201d", "\u201cDo you believe that connection will save you when it goes rampant?\u201d Jirrico\u2019s intelligence Vizier snapped back. \u201cWhen it no longer can \u2013 or will, or wishes to \u2013 differentiate between friend and foe? When it sees all organic life as an enemy? We learned from the Rains, Red Queen. Synthetic intelligence is not to be trifled with and you brokered a deal with a combat intelligence.\u201d", "\u201cAnd you agreed to the terms I offered,\u201d Adrianna replied. The Askanj still didn\u2019t know her true connection to Red One; as far as they were aware, she\u2019d merely been the go-between for the AI \u2013 specifically, Proctor and te Neu representing her \u2013 and the Principality. \u201cYou gave it enough resources to build a fleet and \u2013 what, you have buyers\u2019 remorse? Or now that you have your breathing room, you\u2019ve decided to turn on your ally?\u201d", "\u201cHardly an ally-\u201d", "\u201cEnough,\u201d Jirrico said, cutting the back and forth short. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to assign blame or bicker over decisions made.\u201d He sighed, feeling his crests shrink slightly. \u201cThe Compact is alarmed by what happened in Galhemna,\u201d he told Leblanc. \u201cExtremely so. They believe even more strongly than we in the threat that AI pose and they currently consider Chrysalis, Cocoon and whatever additional horrors those intelligences will be birthing a greater threat than the Principality. Several weeks ago, they sought an armistice. As a show of good faith, they unilaterally halted their forces\u2019 advance into our territory. We could not ignore that.\u201d", "\u201cAnd you\u2019re not currently taking advantage of this out of a sense of fair play?\u201d", "\u201cNo. The Argosy is using this reprieve to repair and rebuild. It will also give us the time we need to begin full-scale production of vessels incorporating our next-generation stealth systems.\u201d That was supposed to be a closely-guarded secret, but the Red Hand had known what the Argosy was up to for some time.", "\u201cSensible,\u201d Leblanc commented. \u201cWhat else is involved in this armistice that you\u2019ve been handed? The Compact hasn\u2019t just waved the white flag because they got a black eye.\u201d", "Jirrico didn\u2019t insult his guest by playing dumb. He had his differences with the Red Queen\u2019s tactics and the death of his nephew remained a sore spot, if not an open wound, then one scabbed over and still faintly aching. \u201cThe Compact has requested our assistance in hunting down and destroying Chrysalis, Cocoon and the rest of their flock. In exchange, they have promised a withdrawal from multiple systems and Segments. We agreed to their terms.\u201d", "The human snorted. \u201cOf course you did.\u201d", "\u201cAt least, so far as they believe.\u201d Jirrico finished the statement unhurriedly.", "That got Leblanc\u2019s attention. She tilted her head, reconsidering Jirrico. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "\u201cWe will never allow a neverborn like Chrysalis free reign across the galaxy,\u201d the Noble Fleet Lord continued. \u201cThe risk not only to ourselves but to all sapient life cannot be tolerated. The Rains taught us that, but the Principality has survived for more than three thousand years. In that time, we have learned other lessons. Foremost among them is that there can be no lasting peace with the Compact of Species. They will never tolerate that which they cannot control. Any detente between our nations has only ever been passing intervals between generations of war. They are the greatest threat to us.\u201d He paused, feeling his crests swell. \u201cIn their arrogance, they believe that we must see what they see and think as they do. So we say and so we act, but the destruction of Chrysalis and Cocoon benefits them far more than us and once those neverborn are dust, this armistice will end.\u201d", "He moved his hand across his desk, the polymimetic surface re-shaping into an overview of the borders between the Compact and the Principality, showing the Compact\u2019s fleets\u2019 suspected locations. \u201cThe Triarchs know all this and I have no doubt they are preparing a contingency for when Chrysalis and its kin are dust. The simplest thing would be declare this Age of Expansion over and usher in a new Period of Stability, but I and my peers within Argosy Fleet Nobility would be derelict if we did not consider potential military options.\u201d", "\u201cFor the moment, it\u2019s in our best interest to accept their terms,\u201d Suun Rin Tor summarized. \u201cTo play for time to rebuild the Argosy\u2019s order of battle and get our new technologies and ships onto the field. Once we are in a better military position, we will be able to push the Space Force out of our territory.\u201d The Askanj-jelhan looked disgusted. \u201cAs Noble Fleet Lord Jirrico mentioned, they have offered to give us back our own worlds and systems for our assistance, as if they were the Triarchs\u2019 to offer.\u201d", "\u201cThose are our peoples and planets,\u201d Jirrico added forcefully. \u201cWe will not barter for the return of our own territories as if we were begging a thief who had broken into our home. Those systems will be ours again, but we are not yet in a position to take them. Not yet. For that, we need time, and for that to happen, we need to appear to be honouring this pact with the Compact. That is why your recent actions have made me apprehensive.\u201d", "\u201cYou may have agreed to terms,\u201d the Red Queen pointed out. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d", "\u201cTrue,\u201d the Askanj-anj replied. \u201cBut since the Pyre, it\u2019s clear that the Principality directly supports the Red Hand. Regardless of the level of control we actually have over you,\u201d None at all, he thought sourly. \u201cThe Compact may take an alternate interpretation and consider your actions an attempt by us to circumvent this ceasefire.\u201d", "\u201cI won\u2019t stop my operations against the Compact.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019d never ask you to,\u201d he assured the human woman. It would have been futile, anyways. \u201cAll we\u2019d like is a certain \u2013 and temporary \u2013 de-escalation when it comes to your larger and more public activities. That\u2019s all. As a favour to your allies,\u201d he stressed that word subtly, but importantly. This wasn\u2019t a superior giving orders to a menial or auxiliary, but a request from a nation that had done much to support the Red Queen and her organization.", "Leblanc was silent. Jirrico wondered what the human was thinking. \u201cIf the Compact has pulled ships and fleets from the Principality lines,\u201d she said at last. \u201cThat means they\u2019ll have more resources available for interdiction, counter-insurgency and anti-piracy duties. My losses will increase \u2013 and this is a time when I can\u2019t afford much more of that.\u201d", "Jirrico shared a glance with Suun Rin Tor. He\u2019d been expecting something like this. The Red Queen might not exactly be a Renegade, but she certainly had a mercenary mindset. Prior to Hatchling, she\u2019d even managed to get herself a cut of the supplies intended for Chrysalis. \u201cSince the pressure on our forward lines has lessened,\u201d Jirrico commented. \u201cIt should be possible to provide a\u2026 certain amount of material resources to offset any decrement in your strength.\u201d", "\u201cThat would be much appreciated. I\u2019m sure that we negotiate a reasonable level of assistance. I also know your government will use mercenary units for certain jobs,\u201d Adrianna continued. The Red Hand had received some contracts like that in the past. \u201cI\u2019ve also heard that they keep a rather short list of organizations that get right of first refusal for those jobs. The groups on that list receive a retainer as well as some other benefits. I\u2019m sure a word from a Noble Fleet Lord would get my organization added to that roster.\u201d", "The Askanj-anj nodded. \u201cYes, that could be done. It would have to be approved by the appropriate oversight bodies, but it is certainly possible.\u201d", "\u201cGood.

Some Argosy assistance with the, ah, moving process \u2013 along with a degree of latitude and benefit of the doubt when it comes to our work \u2013 would be appreciated.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2026 can be discussed,\u201d Jirrico haltingly granted. Trading one criminal syndicate for another was not terribly high on his list of priorities, but he needed to secure the Red Hand\u2019s cooperation. And if nothing else, the insurgents had a zero-tolerance policy towards the flesh trade.", "In any Segment where the Red Hand held sway, trafficking of sapients underwent a significant decrease. As far as he was aware, there was no formal edict from the Red Queen about that particular sector, but her attitude and most especially, actions towards flesh traffickers were well-known within the fringe. There were confirmed reports of slavers running to law enforcement to escape the Red Hand\u2019s justice, preferring incarceration to what the insurgents would do to them. He\u2019d even heard tell that some Renegades had a particular form of execution for members of their cartels who\u2019d worked as slavers \u2013 giving them to the Red Hand. Whether that was true or not was anyone\u2019s guess. He wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if it was. \u201cHowever,\u201d he elaborated. \u201cSuch things would have to discussed at a higher level than a single Segment\u2019s Noble Fleet Lord.\u201d", "\u201cOf course,\u201d the human granted. \u201cI\u2019d have been suspicious if you did agree to all that.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll bring your requests to Kebrak Daun\u2019s Castellan,\u201d Jirrico promised, \u201calong with my own peers and superiors within Argosy Command. We will have a preliminary answer for you shortly, if you would care to remain our guest in this system.\u201d", "\u201cI can spare a few days,\u201d Leblanc agreed. \u201cBut after that, I\u2019ll have to return to my people and continue our operations. If this isn\u2019t resolved by then, I\u2019ll send a delegation to negotiate the particulars.\u201d She didn\u2019t have to mention that those operations would include more strikes at the Compact, nor the time limit that that imposed on the Principality to buy her agreement before she committed any more of the large, public strikes that had led to this meeting. Everyone in the room already understood that.", "\u201cThen we\u2019ll adjourn for now,\u201d the Noble Fleet Lord said. \u201cWhile you wait, please feel free to avail yourself and your crew of the facilities upon Detruch.\u201d Kebrak Daun\u2019s sole inhabited world, it was speckled with domed cities linked by mag trains and railways. Not exactly a resort world, but it was a nice enough change from ships and palisades\u2026 and it was a way to keep the Renegades entertained and away from any military facilities where they might continue to get into places that they weren\u2019t wanted and learn things that they shouldn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019ll even make some ship\u2019s berths available to you and your escorts if you need to take on supplies or carry out maintenance. Consider this my own gesture of goodwill and a token of thanks for responding so quickly.\u201d", "\u201cThank you for the hospitality,\u201d Leblanc replied with a tip of her head. \u201cI\u2019ll return to Eisheth to discuss this matter with my officers and let you take this to your superiors. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d Jirrico rose to offer his guest his hand in the human custom. \u201cI appreciate your understanding of our situation. We\u2019ll be pliable for now, but I assure you \u2013 our response to the Compact\u2019s \u2018armistice\u2019 will be coming, and sooner than they imagine.\u201d", "~", "upon a field of fire and jewels", "surrounded by the black goats and their thousand young", "we beheld the sight of the closed maw", "never knowing", "that it would someday open", "\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d Vinsea asked.", "Nasham set the \u2018scroll down. \u201cVery bad poetry,\u201d he grunted. \u201cI\u2019d suggest the author take some writing courses.\u201d They were in his quarters, sitting on the couch.

After they left Compact space, all contact with them was lost.\u201d", "\u201cNot that unusual, given the state of courier tech at the time.\u201d", "\u201cTrue. A search mission was launched. It came up empty. Canip and his people were written off as missing, presumed dead. Sixty years later, a second, smaller fleet was sent out to the same region of space. None of them ever returned. This time, the search party did find something: Canip\u2019s sigil vessel Acclaimed by Seers and his deputy ship, Cusp of Magnificence. The two ships attacked the search flotilla. Cusp of Magnificence was destroyed with all souls, but Acclaimed by Seers was captured. Through interrogation and piecing together surviving records, the Compact learned that Canip had destroyed the other vessels in his fleet and the second exploration convoy. He claimed that they had been \u2018contaminated\u2019 \u2013 no word on how, of course \u2013 and had to be destroyed, that he was \u2018protecting\u2019 us from something he\u2019d discovered.\u201d", "\u201cWhat was that?\u201d", "Vinsea stroked her chin in a shrug. \u201cNo one knows. Both ships had their nav data completely wiped so we never learned where Acclaimed by Seers went and Canip destroyed virtually all archives aboard his vessel. Most of the crew committed mass suicide when they were boarded. From what CIS was able to piece together, there was some kind of quarantine failure and it spread through his fleet. Among the casualties was Canip\u2019s wife Imirea.", "\u201cAs near as anyone can tell, the uninfected destroyed the contaminated ships and spent the next few decades stewing in paranoid psychosis. When the other exploration flotilla appeared, Canip believed they\u2019d been exposed to whatever agent claimed his people and destroyed them. He was taken into custody and spent the rest of his life in a psychiatric ward. Everything there is from his the diary he kept during that time.

Thousands of years ago, a deadly disease had swept through Oada\u2019s medieval nations. One symptom had been the weeping, open sores upon the victims.

In what\u2019s left of the fleet records are a few scattered references to some discovery they made and implications that it could have been some type of alien construct, but nothing concrete.\u201d Her mouth twitched in a smirk. \u201cAnd by \u2018concrete\u2019, I mean more of what you\u2019ve been reading.

He too knew it was like to lose everyone around you, but Nasham had directed his guilt into anger towards the thing responsible for that. Canip had broken, falling into uncontrollable paranoia and taking refuge in assigning preternatural qualities to his circumstances. There but for the benedictions of fate\u2026 \u201cI never found any references to Canip or this \u2018Open Maw\u2019 of his in my research.\u201d", "Vinsea smiled again, this time a little proud and a little smug. \u201cIntel division is a lot better at rooting through the archives than one group leader, submissive no matter how determined he is. We\u2019ve also put out feelers to Galhemna for their records and any other historical archives. It\u2019s a fairly big net and it will take some time to reel everything in, if we find anything at all. Chances are it\u2019s going to be more like that. There\u2019s a lot of history to comb through for a lot of potential nothings.\u201d", "Nasham appreciated that Vinsea didn\u2019t mince words and openly admitted the possibility that all of this might be nothing but a varak chase. \u201cThank you.\u201d", "She shrugged again. \u201cYou might be crazy and you certainly haven\u2019t made many friends on this ship, but no one denies that you have good instincts, especially when it comes to the Wound. Whatever it was doing with that construct, I believe you: we need to know about it, and sooner instead of later.\u201d", "Nasham tipped in his head in grateful acknowledgment of Vinsea\u2019s trust. He smiled. \u201cHopefully this thread-winding will not end up like our friend Canip and his poetry.\u201d", "\u201cHopefully, but we won\u2019t know until we get more information.

It\u2019s not much, but I think it\u2019s interesting. Don\u2019t you?\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Nasham agreed as he read the contents and an unexpected coldness formed in his liver. \u201cI do.\u201d", "~", "Interlude: Arrival", "Heavy rock music blasted through the length and breadth of the clunky, greebled cylinder of the Silver Dolphin as its pilot, wearing nothing but non-slip socks, danced through the small prospector ship\u2019s hallway. Her necklace swung around her neck, the cross enfolded by the Prophet\u2019s Sign swaying back and forth with every movement, kick and twirl she made.", "Cara Ennis spun across the threshold to her ship\u2019s tiny kitchenette, bobbing her head in time to the beat as she poured herself a cup of coffee \u2013 or what passed for coffee aboard her ship. Mug in hand, she sashayed out of the room and back up the hall, her movements more careful with the steaming liquid, taking a careful sip of and enjoying the hiding-somewhere-in-there hint of flavour. She wasn\u2019t at all concerned with modesty or propriety; she was the captain and sole crewmember aboard Silver Dolphin. It was old, it was creaky and made weird noises in the middle of the night \u2013 well, any and all times, really \u2013 and it looked like someone had taken a cored-out derelict and piled scrap onto it until it was intact again, but it was reliable and most important of all, it was hers.", "Her parents didn\u2019t understand, but they\u2019d helped her with the money to reconstruct the skinny, ugly ship nonetheless. It was her inheritance, she\u2019d been told. Everything that she would have gotten when they passed away had been spent on getting Silver Dolphin into space. She didn\u2019t regret it. She\u2019d overseen the construction, getting elbow-deep in her vessel\u2019s guts herself and she knew every seam, every bolt and every weld throughout its length and breadth. Parts of the vessel dated all the way back to the Siegland Expedition, with various pieces of uncertain age and provenance slapped on until the battered old wreck took flight again.", "Most people would have been going stir-crazy with only two decks of a creaky old rustbucket to putter around in, but Cara loved every hour she spent by herself out in the depths of Nibiru\u2019s solar system. She enjoyed the time she spent with her family and friends on-planet, but there was just something so calming about being the single living person for millions of kilometers around. She could do whatever she wanted, whenever she wanted. She could play the music she wanted, wear what she wanted, act how she wanted \u2013 that was freedom. And once she did start feeling cooped up, she could always go back home and trade bulkheads for open skies and pre-recorded messages for actual conversation.", "Silver Dolphin didn\u2019t just mean freedom for her, it was the culmination of a dream more than a decade and a half old. Silver Dolphin\u2019s maiden flight had been Cara\u2019s and Cara\u2019s alone as she\u2019d slipped the bounds of Nibiru\u2019s gravity and seen the sun rise over the planet\u2019s edge. The last time she\u2019d anything like that was when she was only a little girl. Nibiru didn\u2019t have a lot of space traffic, but she\u2019d always wanted to see dawn come in space. Finally, on her ninth birthday, she\u2019d been able to. That moment had been almost religious for her. It was as if the Prophet Himself was talking to her in that moment, and even from that young age she\u2019d known \u2013 she\u2019d truly known \u2013 what it was she was supposed to do. She would serve Him and the faith not on the ground, but in space.", "With her ship and her pilot\u2019s license and navigator\u2019s certification in hand, Cara had used the last of her money to purchase a charter to survey the outer boundaries of the star system. Fleet Ops guarded those carefully, only allowing men and women of sterling reputation and character to travel further than Imbolc and Samhain. Cara was proud beyond words that she\u2019d met those criteria. Some would claim that Fleet Ops discriminated against nonbelievers, but the faithful had always been well-represented in technical fields. It was only natural that they\u2019d be a majority here, too.", "Her work was routine, but no less vital for that: Silver Dolphin was tasked with carrying and checking in on probes and surveillance satellites as well as occasionally performing surveys of comets, asteroids and other bodies that were far down the Survey Corps priority list, adding them to system maps and navigational archives. It wasn\u2019t a compelling or flashy job, but it was necessary and it was important. More than that, it felt like she was fulfilling a destiny that had been hers since the first time she\u2019d seen her own planet from space.", "She didn\u2019t tell anyone about that part. It was too personal, and even the most devout of the Prophet\u2019s people might raise an eyebrow, chastise Cara for her presumption or even laugh at her for that belief. Here, far from the slowly-growing world of Nibiru, all its austere beauty and the strife that still sparked and flashed through its population, Cara could dream the dreams that she\u2019d kept hidden for so long and imagine that she did indeed have the Prophet\u2019s eye.", "Well, maybe not right just this moment, she thought with a small, embarrassed giggle. But honestly \u2013 how else did you have the chance to dance naked through your own starship? Silver Dolphin was all hers, to make and to do whatever she wanted for herself and for Nibiru. Why shouldn\u2019t she at least enjoy herself on these long missions? The faithful might have a reputation for being stuck up and holier-than-thou, but Cara couldn\u2019t think of better ways to spend her time than having the temperature cranked as if Silver Dolphin was a tropical island, her favourite music blaring through the intercom and being able to dance like no one was watching.", "She skidded onto the cramped command center, the room just big enough for three people but only requiring one. The young woman pirouetted around the leather captain\u2019s chair and plunked herself into it, putting her feet up on a console as the song wound down. \u201cDolly,\u201d she announced. \u201cKill the tunes.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, captain.\u201d The vessel\u2019s computer spoke in a factory-preset voice. There was the genderless default along with four male and four female options. This one was \u2018Marie\u2019. \u201cHow else can I assist?\u201d", "\u201cGive me today\u2019s diagnostic outputs and fuel consumption report.\u201d Cara put her coffee in the cup holder, clicking the mug\u2019s lid securely into place. Almost getting splashed in the face by a cup of scalding hot coffee after a thruster had hiccuped had taught her not to take anything for granted. She checked Silver Dolphin\u2019s course. They were right on track, running ballistic towards their next stopover \u2013 downloading data and performing maintenance on the half-dozen probes on the night side of Tyche, Nibiru\u2019s eleventh planet. Another five hours and Silver Dolphin would be at the first of them. Cara could cut that time down substantially by accelerating, but even discounting the fuel costs, Orbital Control would have a fit if she did that.", "The newest, most advanced parts of Cara\u2019s beloved vessel were its sublight engines. The government didn\u2019t allow anything off-world these days unless their drives strictly conformed to every single one of a dozen pages of requirements all intended to reduce its emissions profile. She thought that was a little on a paranoid side \u2013 okay, a lot on the paranoid side \u2013 but the church and the government were in agreement, so there had to be a reason why they were concerned about any possible signal leakage from Nibiru. That was why they were spending so much time and effort into Operation Vinyl. She didn\u2019t even know if it was going to work, but someone did and they weren\u2019t asking for her opinion.", "Cara had better things to do, anyways. She scrolled through the maintenance logs that Dolly pulled up for her. Nothing had broken or required immediate attention, just the usual daily odds and ends to take care of. Fuel was looking good, too. The tinkering she\u2019d done with the intermix system looked like it was paying off; consumption was 3% less than previous runs.", "Silver Dolphin\u2019s task of checking in with the probes on the edge of the system was a lonely one. She was the only ship for tens of millions of killometers. Most of the work was being done around Nibiru\u2019s moons, primarily Imbolc, but there were additional excavations and surveys on Samhain now. They said it was the Prophet\u2019s work, and she believed that even if she didn\u2019t know what that work was. Siegland had been a great man. Even in death, he was still guiding his children.", "Even if she wasn\u2019t sure what was happening on Nibiru\u2019s sibling moons, she trusted that it would become clear. The Prophet had always had reasons for secrecy before, but it was done with the best interests of the expedition and Nibiru in mind. It had a lot of the nonbelievers upset, though. There were frequent reports of work stoppages and even sabotage on the lunar colonies. They claimed it was a waste of time and resources to do all this when the planetside colonies needed to be developed first and foremost, but the Prophet wouldn\u2019t steer them wrong. This was the path he intended for them and everything would become clear in time. They just needed to have faith.", "In the meantime, she still had her job. Cara just had these six probes to contact before this leg of her mission was complete and she would turn sunward again. Another month, then it was time to head home and leave her blissful isolation behind \u2013 at least for a little while. The woman switched views on the ship\u2019s main screen from the AR-enhanced image of her current course to a much more distant part of the starfield, far out in Nibiru\u2019s Oort cloud, an unseen speck of warmth against the cold of space. The Anomaly.", "The Anomaly was\u2026 well, it was an anomaly. The first hint of it had come decades ago, months after the discoveries on Imbolc and Samhain; astronomy teams noticed a localized rise in temperature and occasional extremely weak EM spikes from a location light-weeks away, inside the system\u2019s Kupier Belt. Nothing had ever shown up on telescopic surveys, leading some to suggest some kind of exotic matter reaction, but the cause was never determined. Over the years, it had been a constant presence in Nibiru\u2019s sky; invisible to the naked eye, extremely faint even to sensors, and at first, too far out for Nibiru\u2019s fledgling fleet to reach.", "Probes had been sent, but whatever they\u2019d found had been classified at the highest levels. Even today, Fleet Ops kept tight control over everything pertaining to the Anomaly. There were three ships from the Survey Corps out there doing\u2026 something. You could physically see them with a big enough telescope, but not what they were clustered around. All transmissions between them and Nibiru itself were heavily encrypted and made by comm lasers or courier. Several weeks ago, the Bonnie\u2019s Venture had tried to slip between the planet and the Anomaly in hopes of intercepting some of those communications. The defence cutter Charlise Kemrick had had to run it off. Once it got back to Nibiru, Bonnie\u2019s Venture had been impounded and its crew had been arrested. They were currently awaiting trial for \u2018obstruction of fleet operations\u2019 and \u2018creating a hazard to navigation\u2019. There were riots as unbeliever protests clashed with faithful counter-protestors. More than a dozen people had already died and entire city blocks had been burnt down.", "Cara shook her head. She honestly didn\u2019t understand the unbelievers. The Prophet had led them all here to Nibiru, hadn\u2019t he? He\u2019d promised to free them all from the oppression and subjugation by a distant, uncaring world and give them all a paradise to make their own. They\u2019d all chosen to follow him and his vision. He\u2019d made good on his word, and even after his death, his wisdom was still shaping Nibiru society. But they still denied and fought against it, creating fractures and friction in what should be a peaceful, unified world.", "She ran her hands through her short hair. That was one reason why she was glad to spend as little time on the surface as she had to these days. It was stressful to have to deal with people completely opposed to everything you believed in. She wished they just\u2026 they just understood. The original colonists had left known space in common cause, but somewhere along the way, that had slipped away and now all of Nibiru was paying the price for that discord. If they just remembered what he\u2019s done for us\u2026! He saw all of this. He led us here. He was touched by something great and grand and\u2026 and\u2026 she didn\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t see that. Part of it was fear, she was certain.", "People were always frightened of what they didn\u2019t understand and the Prophet\u2019s work wasn\u2019t always clear. They wanted all the answers right now, but things just didn\u2019t work like that and they got scared, they got impatient and they wouldn\u2019t let themselves understand. The strife on what should have been a unified world was the result of that unwillingness. The interpreters said that this was all a test, that there could be no true belief if there was no opposition to it and in that, the nonbelievers also served and aided the faithful.", "Cara didn\u2019t know about all that. It seemed like this \u2018test\u2019 had a very cost and both sides continued to entrench themselves deeper in their own ideologies. There is no growth without pain, the Prophet had said. The phoenix does not rise without the flame and Uranus must be butchered for the birth of dragons. Like these creatures of legend, there can be no renewal for us without hardship and sacrifice, both from within and from without. Pity those who do not know me, for when we rise nothing will be left of them but ashes. Cara liked that metaphor, but some of her fellow faithful put a more\u2026 literal spin on it then she felt that the Prophet intended. She didn\u2019t think that was necessary. The nonbelievers were a dwindling minority, already sidelined by a society that didn\u2019t need or want them. In a generation or two, they\u2019d be \u2013 as one of her favourite journalists had said \u2013 \u2018politically extinct\u2019.", "Unfortunately, they knew that too and they were pushing back all the harder, like the last few tribes of Neanderthals trying to drive off a handful of Cro-Magnons, desperately clinging to a place of their own for whatever time that they had left. Trying to put all that discomfort from her mind, Cara watched the patch of space that was the Anomaly for several minutes more. One day, she\u2019d go there. She wondered what she\u2019d see when she did. It could be anything, but she knew it would be something wonderful. Something from the Prophet\u2019s visions \u2013 a gift for his children. Being studied, analyzed and when the time was right \u2013 shared among the worthy.", "Before she could think more on that, an alarm whined sharply and the young woman\u2019s head came up. \u201cAlert,\u201d Dolly commented blandly. \u201cWarp point formation detected.\u201d", "Cara swung herself over to her sensor board and gaped. Dolly was right \u2013 it was a warp point! But how? Nibiru periodically sent scouts out to survey their celestial neighbourhood, but none were supposed to be back for months and this\u2026 this was enormous, far bigger than anything a scout ship could create.", "No\u2026 not just a warp point, Cara realized as her heart skipped several beats and Dolly noted another contact. Two of them. No, three. Then four, then eight\u2026another and another. At last count, there were more than a dozen, the farthest less than two million kilometers from Silver Dolphin. From the writhing holes in reality emerged starships, the smallest of which had to be more than a hundred times the size of Silver Dolphin and the largest\u2026 she couldn\u2019t even begin to guess.", "Cara was frozen in her seat. What... where did they... how did... who are they?! Her ship\u2019s sensors were going haywire, confused and overloaded by the backwash of shiftspace energy. Visuals were the only thing working, the faint unlight of the warp points casting brief, manic illumination over the newcomers\u2019 hulls before the breaches in reality folded in on themselves and closed. Streamers of radiation sparked and flowed over the newly-arrived starships\u2019 hulls as they vented the excess shiftspace energy away.", "The woman was agog, still trying to process these events. Was this some kind of invasion? Who would want to attack Nibiru? She couldn\u2019t think. Silver Dolphin was still coasting towards those monster ships, moments turning into minutes. As more data came in, Cara got at least one answer to the many, many questions raging through her mind. She was close enough now that she could read the hull markings on the lead ship. It was a blocky, arrow-headed thing like the tip of a spear.", "UNITED EARTH CONFEDERACY NAVAL SHIP ARCHURA", "CLX-7319", "\u201cEarth,\u201d she whispered, the blood draining from her face. Oh no. Oh no no no... It was an invasion. Earth had come for Siegland\u2019s people after all, hunting them down across countless light-years. This was... this was bad. She had to... she had to do something. \u201cDolly,\u201d she snapped. \u201cBroadcast our sensor logs and situation systemwide. Let everyone know about this. Everyone.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, Cara. Data compressed. Broadcasting now.\u201d", "Thoughts of self-preservation were next and Cara grabbed her conn display. \u201cI\u2019m bringing us around,\u201d she said. \u201cLight the reactor and get ready to give me emergency thrust.\u201d Those ships were still blind. She had a little time to get away, get out of their range and do... and do something. She wasn\u2019t sure what, but it was better than just sailing blithely into their grasp.", "\u201cYes, captain.\u201d There was a whine from deep inside Silver Dolphin as the ship\u2019s fusion core increased reaction rate, the small, clunky vessel awkwardly rotating end for end. Cara watched reactor output, her hand on the primary throttle, ready to hit the thrusters as soon as Silver Dolphin had the power to do so. But before that could happen, Dolly spoke again. \u201cCaptain, we\u2019re receiving a hail from the closest of the vessels.\u201d", "Cara swallowed. Too late. She\u2019d let herself be shocked into inaction for too long. Conflicting impulses warred inside her. Should she play dumb and run? What if they opened fire? Her ship had no weapons, not even any anti-asteroid defences. They\u2019d swat her like a bug. No, she should talk to them. She didn\u2019t know they were hostile. But they came from Earth...", "At the very least, she could... she could buy time for Fleet Ops to do something. She didn\u2019t know what that might be, but they had to be able to do something. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said after a few moments of panicked internal deliberation, \u201copen a channel and put it on the main screen.\u201d", "The starfield vanished, replaced with the bridge of an unfamiliar vessel. A thin, haggard-looking man in a uniform Cara had never seen before sat in a captain\u2019s chair. He was an older man, possibly in his seventies with thin white hair and pale skin that might once have been a dark olive if he hadn\u2019t spent years living aboard a starship. \u201cThis is Commodore Lorenzo Hastings of-\u201d he froze, his eyes widening. He covered up a surprised cough with one hand before composing himself. \u201cOf the United Earth Confederacy vessel Archura. Are you... are you one of Nibiru\u2019s people?\u201d", "Cara swallowed. \u201cYes,\u201d she told him. \u201cCara Ennis of the private starship Silver Dolphin. What- um, what are you doing here?\u201d", "\u201cHoping,\u201d Hastings replied. \u201cMy ships are in a very bad way, captain. Can you provide us any assistance?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m just a surveyor,\u201d Cara mumbled. \u201cThe nearest drydock is in orbit of Nine. That\u2019s our, uh, ninth planet. You need to head there.\u201d Then her brain caught up with what she was saying. \u201cBut you can\u2019t, I mean... you\u2019re not...\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re not hostile,\u201d the Earther told her. \u201cBut we need help. We lost four-fifths of our convoy getting here and the ships we have got left are on their last legs.\u201d", "Cara tilted her head, looking at her sensor readings. Hastings was right. The closer she got, the more details she could make out. Every single vessel was damaged to one degree or another. All of them had suffered severe structural deformation from long-term, unprotected exposure to shiftspace, with multiple hull breaches. Some of those had been hastily and crudely patched over, while others had been left untended. Some of the damage looked old indeed, wounds that had been patched as best this fleet could over the course of years. She\u2019d never seen the like before and the first, insane thought she had was that it was battle scarring. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d she blurted out.", "A shadow appeared to cross Hasting\u2019s face. \u201cWe survived,\u201d he said quietly.", "\u201cBut... how did you get here?\u201d The Siegland Expedition had spent decades searching for Nibiru, guided by the Prophet\u2019s visions. No one from Earth should have had any idea of where they\u2019d gone, or any reason to look this far for them!", "\u201cThat... is a rather long and complicated story,\u201d the Earther officer told her. \u201cAnd one I\u2019d be happy to share once my people get some help.\u201d", "The young woman bit her lip. Despite everything that she didn\u2019t and didn\u2019t know about this situation, it was clear that Hastings and his fleet really did aid. \u201cI\u2019m just a private citizen,\u201d she told the Earther. \u201cI can\u2019t make any promises on behalf of the Nibiru people, but I\u2019ll escort you to Nine\u2019s drydock.\u201d Having a friendly ship with them might help with first impressions.", "\u201cThank you, captain. That would be appreciated.\u201d", "\u201cCan I ask, though \u2013 what\u2019s Earth like?\u201d", "\u201cEarth...\u201d Hastings began, trailing off. He grew quiet for several moments. \u201cEarth... was beautiful.\u201d He inhaled slowly. \u201cWe\u2019ll contact you again once our ships have their sublights back on-line.\u201d He nodded to someone off-screen and the transmission ended.", "Cara slumped back in her chair, butterflies filling her stomach and her thoughts racing. The events of the last few minutes had been so overwhelming that she didn\u2019t realize until she stood up that she was still naked, and had been the whole time she\u2019d been speaking with Archura. Oh no. We were on a visual link. Prophet... I\u2019m an idiot.", "She turned a very, very bright shade red as she shot up from her chair and rushed to her quarters to get dressed. First impressions, she chastised herself. Helping them with first impressions indeed! With luck, that part of the encounter wouldn\u2019t make it into the history books.", "At least, that\u2019s what she was hoping."]}
