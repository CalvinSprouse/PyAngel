Yes, I decided to add one last chapter to it. This one just working out with the material from both in there. I have about 7 pages of material that I cut out of this one (alternate takes on a couple scenes) and 5 pages of the final chapter written. I haven't decided if I'm going to tie this story off or jump back to the main story. I'm jonesing for some sweet Echo action but I also want to tie off this side tale instead of jumping back and forth. So we'll see what happens.<br>", "<br>", "In this chapter: a slight setback<br>", "<br>", "<b><b>Pt. 5: Ashes</b></b><br>", "<br>", "\u201cHard to port!\u201d Adrianna snapped as <i>Naamah</i> heeled about, moving out of the path of <i>Speartip</i>\u2019s broadsides. Instead of the direct hits the cruiser was hoping for, it scored only a handful of glancing strikes on the Red Hand\u2019s sigil ship. \u201cAll batteries, lock onto <i>Speartip</i> and return fire!\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The heavy cruiser\u2019s guns volleyed back, but the Compact cruiser accelerated wildly, lunging out of the larger ship\u2019s arc and <i>Naamah</i> did no more damage to its target then <i>Speartip</i> had. No matter; there were many other targets for their guns.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThe Knife Eaters have broken formation,\u201d Group Leader Delauz reported, the Prelate snapping his fanged mouth. \u201cThey are retreating. Compact forces are not pursuing.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cOf course not,\u201d Adrianna growled. \u201cThey don\u2019t want the scraps. They want us.\u201d <i>Yuki-Onna</i> went dark as the corvette was holed amidships by a railgun fusillade. That was the last of her corvette strength. <i>Lamashtu</i> and <i>Empusa</i> had been destroyed screening <i>Naamah</i> from the worst of the attack. <i>Rakshasi</i> was, like the rest of her fleet, running as fast it could, but unlike the cutters, bulk cruisers and modified raiders that made up the Red Hand\u2019s void force, the Compact was pursuing it. Like <i>Naamah</i>, <i>Rakshasi</i> was a ship she\u2019d taken from them and they wanted it back. Luckily, it looked like Kuumal had enough of a lead to outpace his pursuers. That was something.<br>", "<br>", "Fifty six.<br>", "<br>", "That was how many warships the Compact had diverted here. Nothing larger than the battlecruiser <i>Adjucator\u2019s Resolve</i>, but to a pirate fleet, it might as well have been a wall of Chariots. They\u2019d been waiting for her. She\u2019d flown right into an trap.<br>", "<br>", "She felt like laughing.<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "The Karkan sky was an ugly bronze as Adrianna walked across the killing field.<br>", "<br>", "His name was Jason Gersham, an Advocate, Submissive. Cabal Squad, Seventh Platoon, 1118th Volunteers. He was laying on his back, unable to move. His spine was broken. So were his arms and legs. Even his ribs were shattered. Ground Force armour wasn\u2019t the equal of Janissary or Blackened powered armour and he\u2019d been caught in the periphery of a blast that had killed the rest of his squad, hurled like a doll across Karkan\u2019s broken ground.<br>", "<br>", "All around her, Adrianna heard the whimpers and cries of the rest of Seventh Platoon\u2019s dying. Anyone who could run already had. It was a familiar sound to her now; from dozens of different species across hundreds of worlds, it was all the same. Some cursed, some begged, some prayed to their gods, others called out for their mothers, their lovers, their children. This was the aftermath that she always made herself see. This time she didn\u2019t find any enjoyment in it.<br>", "<br>", "Seventh Platoon had expected an easy mission, a raid on a dissident safehouse where weapons were being stored. It was supposed to be a photo op for the newest units in the 1118th Volunteers. Rebels being led away in handcuffs or taken away in body bags, pictures of the human Ground Force soldiers standing over confiscated weapons and anti-Compact literature. They hadn\u2019t known that the intelligence coup was one that Adrianna let them have. Oh, Karkan\u2019s resistance was unbelievably sloppy and planetary intelligence had identified the safehouse legitimately. Adrianna had known that they\u2019d known, though. She\u2019d considered simply evacuating the facility, but the opportunity to ambush the Compact had been too good to pass up. She hadn\u2019t expected the 1118th to be ordered in, though. Maybe the Compact\u2019s leaders had thought it a good way to blood Seventh Platoon \u2013 a simple rollover of lightly-armed rebels. Or maybe they\u2019d suspected what she was doing and sent in the humans as cannon fodder, or maybe hoping that she would have held off against her people.<br>", "<br>", "Instead, she was sending an entirely different message than the one she\u2019d planned to. She knelt next to the advocate, submissive. He\u2019d been the highest-ranking survivor left when he\u2019d followed command\u2019s orders and advanced into the teeth of her guns. If it had just been the Karkan rebels, the audacity of the attack would have carried Gersham and his three fragmented squads through. It hadn\u2019t been just them. \u201cYou\u2019re dying,\u201d she said without preamble.<br>", "<br>", "Gersham burbled something, blood and froth spattering over his lips as he tried to speak. Maybe he wanted to curse her, maybe he wanted to beg for his life \u2013 she couldn\u2019t tell. She couldn\u2019t have saved him anyways. The only entity in the universe that might have been able to was thousands of light years away. Instead, the young man was going to drown in his own blood. That was a bad way to go. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have been here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt should have been someone else.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "She leaned over Jason, putting one hand on the back of his head. She helped rise him up, but not too much, mindful of his broken spine. Just enough that he could look past the sickly orange sky, to the horizon where one of Karkan\u2019s storms was drifting over the distant mountains of the Lost Footsteps. Towering cumulonimbus clouds rose into the thin atmosphere, filled with dust and sediment and lit from the inside with flashes of lightning. Forked tongues of electricity licked down from each cloud, roiling spalls of ball lightning illuminating the distant sky. \u201cLook,\u201d Adrianna said softly. \u201cOne of the few beautiful things on this world. Look at that.\u201d Her voice lowered. \u201cTake that with you.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "He made a sound, wet and ragged as he tried to breathe from lungs rapidly filling with blood. Adrianna didn\u2019t even know if he was aware of any of this. With her free hand, she drew her khopesh and thumbed the activation button. The disruption field crackled to life, arcing over the blade. \u201cTake everything beautiful with you,\u201d she told him. In one smooth movement she drove the khopesh through the young man\u2019s backplate. It came out his chest, but he never saw it. His last sight was of Karkan\u2019s small perfections.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThere,\u201d Adrianna said as she laid the submissive back on the ground. \u201cNow you know.\u201d She wasn\u2019t talking to him, but to his superiors who would review the footage his helmet cam was recording. \u201cAnyone you send after me will die. I will kill them and I will keep killing until the Canyon is free of your stink. Until every serf in the sector is free of you. Until every \u2018uncivilized\u2019 being knows of your towering hypocrisy. Until your cities are in flames and you can no longer hide from every atrocity you\u2019ve committed.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The woman touched Gersham\u2019s face. \u201cHe died because you were cowards,\u201d she continued, never once raising her voice. \u201cBecause you sent children after me. You sat in your bunkers and your barracks, shitting yourselves in fear and sending raw recruits out for <i>your</i> battles. Did you think I wouldn\u2019t fight? No, you knew. You knew and you didn\u2019t care. You wanted to see \u2018Broken\u2019 killing each other. Fine. I\u2019m giving you this one as a gift. I hope you enjoyed it, because it will be the last pleasure you have. I\u2019m going to take everything from you. I\u2019m going to dig you out of the holes you cower in, pull you into the light of day and lay all your sins at your feet.\u201d Adrianna stood. \u201cLike I said, I hope you enjoyed the show.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "That evening\u2019s news on Karkan was headlined by the sacrifice Seventh Platoon made in attacking a rebel stronghold, diverting dissident forces away from several other bases of operations that were struck by planetary police, CST enforcers and military. The cowardly nature of the rebels, their complete disregard for society, the damage that they were doing to the image of their fellow species, their ruthlessness in executing the wounded was played up for maximum salaciousness. Many talking heads opined that this kind of wanton brutality and reflexive aggression against authority simply proved the barbarity of the lower species and how infectious dangerous rhetoric could be, even duping or drawing in the weaker-willed members of more civilized races. Citizens were urged to be on guard for potentially disloyal acts or sentiments and reminded that such vigilance was the price that the Compact paid as they attempted to guide less civilized beings away from such aggression.<br>", "<br>", "Contrasting this punditry was the courage and valour of Seventh Platoon. Jason Gersham was memorialized as a hero who\u2019d taken command of the tattered remnants of the platoon and led them on a charge against the enemy positions, driving the dissidents from their holes and routing them but dying in the doing. Dead martyrs played better than live heroes, after all. The latter might have commented on such things as \u2018insufficient support\u2019 and \u2018faulty intelligence\u2019. As it was, none of the survivors of Seventh Platoon were in a position to counter the official story and if any felt inclined to do so, then it was simply a matter of pointing out that doing so would dishonour the memory of their fallen comrades.<br>", "<br>", "The deaths of so many humans was fed into the media\u2019s propaganda mill as a reminder that younger races had the potential for greatness in them and that by following the guidance of their betters, they could achieve much. That those who followed the Compact were a beacon for others to follow and if they died in their duty, then they would remain an example for all to see and follow. Those like the dissidents who lashed out against the society that fed, clothed and nurtured them fought only for their own selfish desires. They were unstable, failing to properly assimilate and rather than redress such failings, blamed those around them for it.<br>", "<br>", "No mention was made of the Red Hand\u2019s presence, nor of the futile manhunt Karkan authorities performed in an attempt to locate the \u2018red queen\u2019 and her fellow terrorists. It would disrupt the narrative.<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "<i>Naamah</i> shuddered as another missile struck home, wiping away one of her point defence batteries. The heavy cruiser\u2019s shields had collapsed and the Compact fleet was moving in, picking at the wounded heavy cruiser with surgical precision. She\u2019d surprised them with her new missiles. Not enough to even the odds, not remotely \u2013 but enough to bleed them more than they\u2019d expected. Even now, <i>Naamah</i> was still fighting back; she\u2019d sent another destroyer to Hell and was setting her teeth in one of the enemy cruisers, firing on it relentlessly, even as its comrades moved in for the kill.<br>", "<br>", "Twelve different capital ships were firing on <i>Naamah</i>; if they\u2019d wanted to, they could have easily and utterly destroyed the warship, but that wasn\u2019t the plan, was it? They wanted the ship intact. They wanted its databanks, they wanted <i>her</i>. That was why they cared so little about the rest of Adrianna\u2019s retreating fleet. Better to make sure they took the Red Queen then try for every possible ship and have even the smallest chance that she\u2019d slip through their fingers. Once she was gone, there would be a power struggle for control of the Red Hand, between her fellow rebels and the pirates and mercenaries.<br>", "<br>", "And, of course, the Compact wanted witnesses to her defeat... to have every surviving Red Hand spread the tale of how their \u2018infallible\u2019 leader had been brought down. Much as she hated it, she was the heart of the organization. Some loved her, some feared her, some followed her for the cause, others for the blood they could spill, but she was a fixed point for each of them: the Red Queen. The woman that the Compact couldn\u2019t kill. They\u2019d tried time and again over the years and each time she had survived. They couldn\u2019t just destroy her ship \u2013 without a body to parade around, there\u2019d always be that question of whether she survived. They needed to kill not just her, but the myth of her.<br>", "<br>", "It looked like they just might do it this time.<br>", "<br>", "Adrianna snapped out orders as her warship and crew died around her. If this was going to be her last stand, it would be as bloody as she could make it.<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Adrianna said by way of greeting as Lucas came into her office. She didn\u2019t move to look at him, leaning over a table as she sifted through holographic news reports. All of them were from Alhensa. He\u2019d been there until a few days ago, overseeing some minor administrative duties until the Landing Square Massacre.\u201cThis was supposed to be a peaceful rally against Tamib. He was supposed to act like the condescending piece of shit he is and we were supposed to end up with a public relations boost. Instead, we have pro-Compact rioting as everyone rallies around the flag. The System Collective has been disgraced, their leader was killed \u2018resisting arrest\u2019.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI wanted something simple and quiet.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cSomeone set off a bomb,\u201d Lucas replied, aiming for an attempt at levity.<br>", "<br>", "Leblanc looked up at him. She wasn\u2019t amused. \u201cThank you, Lucas. I wasn\u2019t aware of that.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThe Alhensans have been pushing to be more proactive,\u201d Lucas said, reaching to adjust the table\u2019s holographic interface, bringing up field reports. \u201cIt looks like someone decided not to wait for our go-ahead.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThe Alhensans are <i>idiots</i>,\u201d Adrianna growled. \u201cWe\u2019ve been restricting violence there for a reason, pushing funding into the System Collective party. Koooual had a good shot, especially with all the dirt we\u2019ve dug up on Tamib and his CST cronies.\u201d She inhaled through her nose. \u201cIt was a simple plan. Every time Tamib and his Stability Party cracks down, we push back. He\u2019s been bleeding votes and districts for years now and this election we could have gotten the Collective in as the official opposition. Maybe \u2013 just maybe! \u2013 even got Koooual the governorship.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cNot that she\u2019d thank us,\u201d Lucas observed.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cTrue, but that was the point. We get someone we like in, someone above reproach with no connection to us. Alhensa liberalizes and, magically, when they stop treating the client population as helots, they stop experiencing unrest and we stop blowing holes in their ships.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIdiots.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cWe don\u2019t know it was one of the Alhensan cells. It could have been the Compact. Tamib\u2019s administration was facing senate hearings for those backdoor deals with the CST. Now, everyone\u2019s forgotten that.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they did it or one of our cells went rogue,\u201d Adrianna snapped. \u201cBlame\u2019s already been assigned and someone claiming to represent the dissident movement has taken credit for it. We had a planet on the brink of regime change. Now we\u2019ve got a massive backlash in public opinion, we\u2019ve got Alhensan police, CST enforcers and Compact military wading into our cells who are screaming for the weapons we promised them.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cFuck \u2018em,\u201d Lucas said, pulling up a chair next to the table. \u201cThey went off the reservation. Let them deal with the consequences.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI\u2019d like nothing better than to cut my losses,\u201d the woman replied, running a hand through her hair. \u201cBut if we do that...\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201c...it will damage our credibility,\u201d Lucas finished. \u201cIf we promise aid and then withhold it when our cells actually need it, the rest are going to start to wonder if we\u2019ll do the same thing to them.\u201d He paused. \u201cAlhensa\u2019s on total lockdown, Adri. It was hard enough for me to get out of the system. Getting anything in \u2013 especially weapons \u2013 is going to be hard and it\u2019s going to cost a lot more.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cAnd our finances aren\u2019t in that great a state right now, I know.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cWe\u2019re still making money. Even with the R&amp;D at Minos Perch and all these little resistance cells and political parties we\u2019re propping up, we\u2019re still in the black.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cWe\u2019re not making <i>enough</i> money, though. We\u2019ve got mercenaries, pirates and smugglers in our ranks. They don\u2019t like hearing that they\u2019re not going to be making credits hand over fist.\u201d Adrianna sighed, her shoulders slumping. \u201cWe\u2019re losing ground. At best, we\u2019re in a holding pattern. The Compact\u2019s good at quashing rebellions. Hell, they\u2019re good at making sure that they never happen in the first place! If the CST wasn\u2019t so monumentally corrupt, we wouldn\u2019t have a quarter of the traction we do in the Canyon.\u201d Adrianna turned away from the table. \u201cTell me the truth, Lucas: do you think I made a mistake here?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The older man paused, thinking the answer over. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted. \u201cYou\u2019ve expanded the Red Hand faster than almost any other cartel I\u2019ve heard of and you\u2019ve kept it together. You\u2019re good in the void, Adri. You\u2019ve got an entire sector running scared of your ships. You\u2019ve been building up alliances with the other cartels and they\u2019ve fallen into line for the most part. We have the run of the sector and choice of hunting grounds. If it were just that, we\u2019d be rolling in credits. This political angle and the resistance you\u2019ve been building up? I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re getting good intel from some of these cells and made good connections through others. There\u2019s potential there, but I think you\u2019re trying to do too much too fast. I know how to keep the books and from that angle, those are money sinks. They\u2019re costing us time and resources that I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re able to spare right now. Maybe we should ease off the ground side of things for a while, just to focus on what we\u2019re good at.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI can hit convoys and take out patrols for years and not make a single bit of difference,\u201d Adrianna replied sourly. \u201cThat\u2019s was this was about, Lucas. Making a <i>difference</i>. Showing the people that they don\u2019t have to lie down and accept the way things are. They don\u2019t have to be second-class citizens because some self-styled superior asshole says that they are. They don\u2019t have to nod along and keep their heads down. They can do something about it. They can <i>change</i> things... but you\u2019re right. It feels like I am pushing too hard. For all the good we\u2019ve done, we still haven\u2019t made much progress at all. It\u2019s costing us. Worse, I have to walk this fucking tightrope every day. I do too little and we\u2019ll lose the momentum we\u2019ve got. Too much and our cash reserves dry up.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThe news isn\u2019t showing it all, you know.\u201d Lucas said after a quiet moment passed. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening on Alhensa.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThey never do.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThat\u2019s true, but here\u2019s the thing Adri: the local cells want those weapons because they\u2019re fighting back. Governor Tamib is barricaded in the gubernatorial palace. He jumped the gun trying to arrest Koooual. When she was killed, she became an instant martyr. The news is trying to spin it so it seems the System Collective was in bed with the terrorists that set off that bomb, but people aren\u2019t buying it. When news of Koooual\u2019s death hit the air, there was a huge riot from Collective supporters and client races alike. Tamib called his buddies in the CST to suppress it. That\u2019s only led to hardening resistance. The other political parties who were in lockstep with his hardline stance on terrorism are trying to distance themselves from him now. He\u2019s scrambling to cover his ass and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen. Once the Compact at large learns that he took a prosperous, profitable world and mismanaged it to the point of widespread insurrection, they\u2019re going to make an example out of him.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThat\u2019s something.\u201d Adrianna stood. \u201cOkay. We\u2019ll try and get something to the Alhensan cells. After that, I\u2019ll dial down the focus on the planetary movements. We\u2019ll still work on that front, but we\u2019ll tread softer. We\u2019ll be more Mao than Guevara,\u201d she grinned at the reference only she understood. \u201cThat will give the Perch time to get our new weapons up and running. We\u2019ll shore up our interests out-sector to keep that revenue coming in. I think Vien has a few avenues that should be easy to exploit without stretching ourselves too thin.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The older man nodded. \u201cSounds good.\u201d He paused. \u201cI know you hate having to step back, but it\u2019s the right call. If we move a little bit slower, we can shore up our networks and infrastructure. We\u2019ll keep everything on a slow burn, so we can boil it over all at once.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI said something similar not too long ago.\u201d Adrianna looked over at the table with the Alhensan reports. \u201cThanks. I guess I need to pulled up short every once in a while.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m here for,\u201d Harker replied. \u201cThe fire rises, but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t need the occasional douse of water.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cAt the very least, Emmet\u2019ej will stop showing me those projections of how I\u2019m going to end up destroying the entire Unbound presence in the Canyon.\u201d Adrianna looked over at Harker. \u201cI have the urge to beat on someone.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThe Grasping Sands have started to run slaving operations out of Nemoti again,\u201d Lucas suggested. \u201cIn strict contradiction of your orders.\u201d The Red Hand did a lot of questionable things, but slaving was not one of them. In fact, they were more brutal towards slavers than any legitimate government. Every Unbound clan or cartel that wanted to do business with the Red Hand had to forsake all trafficking in sapient beings. The most explanation Adrianna had ever given anyone for that was \u2018because I say so\u2019. Lucas knew her well enough that she didn\u2019t need to explain why she held such loathing for slavers, but anyone else would only ever get the first answer. \u201cWill that do?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "She smiled at him then. The familiar, hungry grin of a she-wolf. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it will.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "The bait had been crafted well: a military citadel being put up right in the heart of the Red Hand\u2019s hunting grounds, an outfitting and repair station that could have armed and tended to half a dozen warships, allowing them free reign to counter the Red Hand\u2019s piracy. The information had leaked to her from \u2018reliable sources\u2019. The local Space Force had known that an unknown number of their civilian overseers were compromised by the Red Hand and they had, quite illegally, undertaken the construction, arming and development of the outpost with misappropriated funds. If it had managed to come on-line, it would have crippled her actions in a wide area and been hailed as a counter-intelligence coup. If it was destroyed, publicly... Local Command would not come off nearly as well. She hadn\u2019t had the time to clear this data with Red One \u2013 her lines of communication with <i>Nemesis</i> were measured in months, so she\u2019d had to act with what she had.<br>", "<br>", "A military outpost, incomplete or not was problematic for any pirate force to handle and it wouldn\u2019t be unprotected. She\u2019d gathered every ship that she had available only instead of an unfinished citadel and a handful of escorts, she found herself in a net of Compact warships, harried in-system, shedding forces as her ships were either destroyed or ran for their lives. She\u2019d taken her <i>vassa anka</i> and driven them towards the Compact command. They\u2019d been surprised by that; they\u2019d expected her to keep running. <i>Even after all this time, they still underestimate me.</i><br>", "<br>", "Not that that would do much good right this moment, though. <i>Naamah</i> continued to lash out, but the warship\u2019s firepower dropped steadily as the surrounding warships continued to pick away at the heavy cruiser, carefully targeting their salvos to ensure that the vessel would be crippled, but not destroyed. She\u2019d hurt them, beating that last cruiser into a hulk and several of the attackers showed the results of her guns. They were covering each other now, one ship withdrawing as soon as its screens wavered, undamaged ships protecting its until it could restore its defences. Behind the wall of tormentors, the command ship <i>Adjucator\u2019s Resolve</i> lurked, safe from her guns and any attempt at a death-or-glory charge.<br>", "<br>", "The rest of the formation was moving in towards her now, too. A handful of the Compact ships were still chasing after the remains of her fleet, but that was more to discourage them from coming back than any serious attempt at interception. As she watched, a cluster of hostile red markers appeared around several of the cruisers and swarmed towards <i>Naamah</i>.

The Red Hand had just received an extremely unpleasant bit of intelligence from one of their sources in Local Command. \u201cEspecially when it looks like Local Command intentionally cut the civilians out of the loop on this one. This was completely black-boxed, commander. They were shuffling funds earmarked for other uses around to pay for it.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cAn <i>Ironbound Bastion</i>-class citadel,\u201d she repeated. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything that can take one of those down.\u201d She raked fingers through her blue hair. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t our scouts or hunters reported seeing it?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cWe have noticed an increase in military movements around the Onthana system,\u201d Strategist Anto\u2019el reported. The Thoughtful\u2019s fingers drummed on the display table. \u201cNo indication of such construction was observed, although it could have been concealed. I admit that our probes in Onthana have been limited. The system is uninhabited and provides no strategic or economic benefit to the sector at large. Its only value comes from its location in our hunting grounds. Until we began to operate in the Magnameric Canyon, there was no reason to defend or safeguard Onthana. The measures to which Local Command has gone to erect this fortification suggests a measure of urgency.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cWe\u2019re hurting them,\u201d Lucas summarized. \u201cThey need to do something to curb our operations.

It could cripple our void operations throughout this section of the Canyon. We need those to stay up and running.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThen we cannot allow it to be completed,\u201d Delauz affirmed, <i>Naamah</i>\u2019s leader growling with certitude. \u201cIt must be destroyed.

We must act.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cIt won\u2019t be unguarded,\u201d Anto\u2019el pointed out. \u201cAnd even partially operational, it will be difficult to destroy. It will require a substantial number of our active ships for any chance of success.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Adrianna was silent for a moment, looking over the data. \u201cYes, it will...\u201d she mused.

Her <i>vassa anka</i> were wrecks and her sigil had been overrun. Resistance had been pathetically light, the ship undermanned and under-equipped. They\u2019d taken every section with ease. Ideologue Jante (and five names besides) was standing on the Unbound ship\u2019s command deck. His nostrils twitched at the metallic stench of blood. The bridge would need to be scoured clean of the taint of the Unbound before it could returned to service, obliterating all trace of its enslavement.<br>", "<br>", "The ship had been liberated, his soldiers in key positions throughout the vessel and the Red Queen was his captive.

All your gains are nothing. Your surviving fleet is running for its life, your Red Hand is shattered. Your cabals will be rooted out an destroyed. You will be paraded before an angry public and executed as a traitor to the Compact. Nothing you\u2019ve done will matter. Tell me,\u201d he growled. \u201cIs this everything you imagined?\u201d He lowered his voice further still. \u201cI had an uncle, you know. He was a Janissary, like me. Perhaps you encountered him. His name was Rynzlr.\u201d Her eyes widened fractionally and Jante put his hand on the Broken\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt is unseemly to admit, but I confess that I will take pleasure in watching them put you down like the animal you are.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "She stared at him for a moment and then started to laugh.</div>"]}

Long blue hair glinted in the landing bay\u2019s lights and blue eyes danced mischievously. \u201cMatron,\u201d one of the assembled coterie began. \u201cWe await your command.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cGood,\u201d the pirate queen replied, breezing past her entourage. They followed her like smaller vessels swept up in a battleship\u2019s wake. \u201cThe blackout will remain in effect for another seventeen hours,\u201d she ordered. \u201cAfter which time, we\u2019ll plot a course back to Minos Perch. No, you don\u2019t get to know what happened. No, you don\u2019t get to know who or what I met, or even if I did meet anyone and didn\u2019t just want to fuck with you.\u201d She stepped into a tram car, gesturing to several of her officers, Lucas among them, to accompany her further. \u201cEngineering.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "As the car moved through <i>Naamah</i> guts, the heavy cruiser\u2019s second officer spoke up. \u201cEngineering reports no issues, matron. Why-\u201c he paused, looked at the others in the car, but all of them averted eye contact. Lucas smirked slightly. No one ever wanted to be first into see how cold the water was. \u201cWhy are we heading there?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna smiled. She was quick to smile, but as everyone in the Red Hand \u2013 and more than a few outside it \u2013 knew, this was not always a good thing. \u201cWe have a Builder in Engineer,\u201d she replied. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got something that needs to be built.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Builders annoyed Adrianna.<br>", " <br>", "Her chief engineer, Juum-ope-cand, was no exception. The bulging eyes, the liquid, rolling way they moved, the ragdoll limbs that twitched and wobbled like severed lizard\u2019s tails... those she could handle. What irritated her was that they were always so damn <i>happy</i>. Even when they were actually angry, upset or sad they sounded pleased.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cRed Queen. Yes. Good to see. Was worried. Ship is silent, scopes are quiet. Worrisome,\u201d Juum-ope-cand bubbled exuberantly, his translated voice barely audible over his normal language. \u201c<i>Naamah</i> wants to fly, to hunt, to hurt. Enjoys it.\u201d His wide eyes blinked. \u201cLike our queen, yes.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI have something for you,\u201d Adrianna said, drawing a data drive out of her tunic. She handed it to the Builder. One of his long, tentacle-like arms reached for it, his delicate little fingers accepting the drive. He wobbled over to the nearest computer console. Builders were the youngest of the ruling races, but renegades could be found in all works of life.<br>", " <br>", "Builders were a short species, generally less than six feet tall with wide faces, several Jacobson\u2019s organs in place of a nose and large, blubbery lips. Their skin was always slightly translucent, tinted blue, green, purple or some combination of those hues. With their rotund bodies and stumpy little legs, they seemed almost comical, like those wide-bottomed dolls that rocked back and forth on the floor, but underestimating them due to their speech patterns or their appearance was a mistake. Their vision was among the best of any species and they had mind-bogglingly precise fine motor control with those dexterous little fingers. They could visualize an object three-dimensionally, even if showed only one side of it and possessed a nearly preternatural affinity for construction and design. They were meticulous workers, with an incredible gift for engineering, architecture and technology.<br>", " <br>", "It was said that if you gave a Builder something, on the first day they\u2019d play with it. On the second, they\u2019d take it apart and on the third, they would have built you a better version of it. If they had one flaw it was that their mindset was to imitate and improve, not necessarily <i>innovate</i>. It wasn\u2019t that the entire species was unimaginative or unable to invent new things \u2013 they\u2019d never have raised themselves out of their prehistory if they couldn\u2019t do that \u2013 but nine times out of ten, Builders preferred to tweak existing concepts rather than try to make something new. Their greatest technological advancements usually came about because of they were unable to improve what they already had any further. They\u2019d used (ever more efficient and capable) prop-driven aircraft for over two hundred years before some radical thinker invented the jet engine.<br>", " <br>", "There didn\u2019t even seem to be any societal or cultural reason for this conservatism. It was just... how their minds worked. They were fastidious and highly sought-after technical specialists, but they always preferred sticking with what had been \u2018proven\u2019 to work rather than risk something new and untested.<br>", " <br>", "Juum-ope-cand brought up the data, his eyes goggling at it. He turned back to Adrianna. \u201cOur queen brings something new, yes. Something unexpected. Have not seen these before. No.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lucas asked, stepping over to the console. His eyes widened as he looked at the display. \u201cWait. Is that...?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cJackal technology, yes. Missile drives. Chasses. Warheads. Old technology. Not modern, no.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna coquettishly touched a finger to her lips. \u201cBut better than what we have now, yes?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d the Builder said, dexterous fingers dancing along the control board, subsetting the data into multiple screens, his eyes swivelling between each smaller window. \u201cExpended <i>Naamah</i>\u2019s onboard ordnance. No capital missiles left. No designs, no sources. Other ships use fringe-built missiles. The clans steal a handful here, a handful there. Not as effective as the Space Force. Always the way. Until now, yes.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cCan you build them?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Juum-ope-cand turned back to Adrianna, stiffening with professional pride. \u201cI am Builder. Yes. I build. I will make these.\u201d He bubbled something to himself, turning back to the data. \u201cDifficult to make to Jackal specifications. Expensive.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cDo what we can afford.\u201d Adrianna leaned over the smaller Builder. \u201cThere\u2019s more on the drive. Go through it. Tell me what we can do now, and what we\u2019ll need to work our way up to.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d Juum-ope-cand answered, barely registering the human\u2019s presence any longer as he looked lovingly at the technical specs of the Red Hand\u2019s newest weapon.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Word spread quickly throughout <i>Naamah</i>, anxiety and uncertainty replaced with excitement and curiousity. Adrianna remained tight-lipped on the exact nature of their mission here, but that only fuelled the rumours. The data she\u2019d brought back was worth a fortune. There were the specifications for military grade weapons and technology \u2013 although they were generally outdated, last-generation technology, that still put them beyond what the Unbound usually made do with. Nothing cutting-edge and certainly nothing of <i>Nemesis</i>; the former strained the bounds of what an Unbound cartel \u2013 even one like the Red Hand \u2013 was capable of and as soon as the latter was recognized, it would bring the Compact\u2019s full fury down on Leblanc and her clan, far too soon.<br>", " <br>", "There was also account information and personal access codes belonging to many of the oligarchs and mega-corporations of the Magnameric Canyon. Adrianna couldn\u2019t imagine how Red One had gotten that kind of information. Well. She could imagine several different ways. There were also other little bits and pieces of data, useful fragments that the warship had recovered during her raids throughout the Compact. She couldn\u2019t act on them directly, but through an appropriate cat\u2019s paw? Maybe.<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna smiled, her eyes alight as she scrolled through the data. This was more than she\u2019d ever dreamed. She had hackers of her own, still others freelanced on her payroll. They\u2019d managed good pulls before, but this was another order entirely. Secrets, lies and hidden truths all buried and hidden for years. Bits and pieces that Adrianna had hoped to be able to use, but could never get... while Red One had been able to find them, but couldn\u2019t exploit them. It was a perfect symbiosis.<br>", " <br>", "The woman leaned back in her chair. If she used this information to its full extent, she\u2019d committing her clan to outright war. To the <i>Long War</i>, a battle none of them knew about, many wouldn\u2019t have cared about and even more would have been horrified to learn of.<br>", " <br>", "\u2018If\u2019. Now, that was funny \u2013 there was no \u2018if\u2019 for her. It was \u2018when\u2019. It had been when ever since she\u2019d sat down at her father\u2019s workbench with a pile of electronics and explosives in front of her and known that this was the only way to protect her family. The system didn\u2019t work, not if you were the people at the bottom. It protected those at the top, those with the money and the power and the laws to say that everyone else was <i>less</i>. When it became that rotten, that filled with corruption and self-serving, self-righteous monsters... then it had to be burnt down. She\u2019d sacrifice her life for that. She\u2019d sacrifice others for it. Kill them, lie, cheat, steal and murder all for the sake of a vision that might not ever come true. They called her a monster, thought of her a something unclean and shameful. Let them. Let them spit on her memory for the next thousand years, or let her die alone and unremarked and forgotten. Just as long as she could fight before she died and <i>hope</i> that it would mean something.<br>", " <br>", "That was the most important lesson she\u2019d learned back on Rally. Sometimes, you had to fight. You couldn\u2019t talk your way out of it, you couldn\u2019t back down, you couldn\u2019t do anything but make the other person bleed. It didn\u2019t matter if you won or lost, it didn\u2019t matter if anyone noticed or cared. It only mattered because you had to do it \u2013 you couldn\u2019t let them get away with what they were doing. No one had wanted to hear that. They\u2019d all loved the Compact, been against that she could kill such a respected man as Commissioner Sath.<br>", " <br>", "That was why she wouldn\u2019t stop, not until they finally managed to kill her.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThe fire rises,\u201d she said to herself. <i>Vincere vel mori</i>.<br>", " <br>", "The comm beeped, pulling her out of her melancholy. \u201cYou have a visitor, matron.\u201d It was Jhan, one of her armsmen. She didn\u2019t like the feeling of being watched and guarded everywhere she went, but it was part of the act. No Unbound queen would be seen anywhere without an appropriate entourage and a coterie of exceptionally lethal bodyguards was just one part of that. Adrianna made less use of them than others might, but as Lucas was fond of pointing out, she wasn\u2019t invulnerable. She\u2019d survived more than anyone thought possible, but she could die... and they had come in handy more than once.<br>", " <br>", "Speaking of Lucas, that was him on the security feed, standing outside the door to her quarters, blocked by her armsmen. Even the second in command of the Red Hand\u2019s military didn\u2019t get unimpeded access to the \u2018Red Queen\u2019s\u2019 personal chambers. \u201cSend him in,\u201d she told Jhan. On the monitor, the Tribune\u2019s head moved in a small, choppy nod and he and his confederate stepped aside for Harker.<br>", " <br>", "Lucas strode over to Adrianna\u2019s desk. \u201cMy queen,\u201d he said with utter formality.<br>", " <br>", "The woman leaned back in her chair. \u201cColumn leader.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Silence stretched. \u201cWho was it?\u201d Harker pointed past her, to the window. It wasn\u2019t showing the local starfield, but instead the view was set to a panorama from some distant nebula, gentle violet, blue and red washing into the room. \u201cWho\u2019s out there, Adrianna? The crew think it\u2019s the Principality, that they\u2019ve finally decided to give us something more than a few scraps, but don\u2019t want to provoke a crusade. But that\u2019s not it, is it?\u201d He leaned forward, resting his hands on her desk. \u201cWho did you meet?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cCareful,\u201d Adrianna warned, leaning back in her chair. The form-fitting material shifted, perfectly supporting her.<br>", " <br>", "Lucas shook his head. \u201c<i>God damn it, Adrianna</i>. Enough with this secrets bullshit. You like to play it close to your chest. Fine. But I\u2019ve been with you for how long? Since you came into the Cursed Red Gauntlets and you were <i>azea haal</i>, Vuld\u2019s favourite-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "She was out of chair faster than it took a human heart to beat, every muscle tensed and her fists clenched. Lucas realized he\u2019d crossed a line. One of the worst to cross, in fact. She put up with that nickname from other Unbound and those who didn\u2019t know any better. It had served her in the beginning, but no one in the Red Hand had called her <i>azea haal</i> in years. Now and forevermore, she was the Red Queen. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have \u2013 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Her nostrils flared, her blue eyes flashed... and then her features softened and she sat back down. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know,\u201d she said at last. \u201cThat\u2019s not me being coy. <i>You</i> don\u2019t want to know.\u201d She liked Harker. As he said, they\u2019d known each other since she\u2019d been initiated into the Cursed Red Gauntlets. He was an old freighter hand turned smuggler than pirate. He didn\u2019t believe in the cause as much as she or many of the recruits did; he knew that humans and many other species got a raw deal in the Compact, but to him that was just the way things were. You did what you could with the hand you were dealt, and that was all. \u2018No point trying to change the deck\u2019, he\u2019d told her once.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Backwash was a hell of a drink. At least, to humans. Other species thought it was cheap rotgut. Tribunes barely noticed it. Shimmers and Steersmen took to it. For most other species, all it had going for it was that was inexpensive and easy to brew. Almost every Unbound ship or station had at least one still and hence, plenty of backwash. Lucas always knew how to pick out the good stuff, though. Relatively speaking.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>He\u2019d brought her this bottle as a celebration. The Odegan Independence League had accepted the Red Hand\u2019s offers of alliance. Truthfully, it wasn\u2019t much to celebrate. The League was the most organized point of political opposition to the Compact on Odega, but even they had never done anything more than wave placards and march through a few streets. A few of the League\u2019s most daring members had actually committed acts of </i>vandalism<i> against CST vehicles and buildings. There were a handful of firebrands in there, though. They just needed to be encouraged and if there was one thing that Adrianna had gotten good at, it was motivating people. Give her a few weeks and she\u2019d have protests turning to riots. The CST would turn up the heat on the Odegans. They\u2019d either knuckle under, or push back and when they did...</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cBunch of dumb kids,\u201d Lucas said as he poured himself another drink. He\u2019d had more than his fair share. Adrianna had had enough to be polite, but she wasn\u2019t drunk. She\u2019d never been drunk before she\u2019d been rebuilt and with her implants, now she never would be. She\u2019d learned to fake it, though. People were surprisingly open when they were drinking with you, or assumed you were plastered. It also put them at ease, made it easier to forget that she wasn\u2019t quite like them any more \u201cDon\u2019t know what they\u2019re in for.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cThe first steps towards the liberation of their world,\u201d Adrianna said with theatrical pomposity, but Lucas wasn\u2019t in the mood. He glared at her.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cDon\u2019t hand me that shit,\u201d he\u2019d grunted. \u201cThey\u2019re in for a short, shitty life and you know it.

The Compact likes quashing dissent, but they like it clean when they present it. Rubble that used to be a building.

Neat and tidy and all wrapped up for everyone to see and learn from. \u2018You can\u2019t stop us.

It\u2019s not pretty, it\u2019s not easy. Maybe I can turn the Odegans into something more than a handful of dissatisfied helots and fashionably rebellious teens. Maybe all I\u2019ll get from them is riots and \u2018Remember Odega\u2019 banners waved on other worlds.

That we\u2019re stupid, clumsy Broken with \u2018functional minds\u2019. We can chart our own destiny, away from the Triarchs and their hired thugs. Every single \u2018client race\u2019 has that right.

It means plague because there\u2019s no medicine. It means crashing economies because there\u2019s no more industry. It means war and a return to the bad old days for us. You remember those, don\u2019t you? We almost went extinct.\u201d The older man shook his head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want that for anyone back on Rally, no matter how sanctimonious those pricks can be.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cYou\u2019d rather be a slave than-\u201d she regretted the words as they left her mouth and cut herself off.

Lucas was a good officer, better than many of the self-styled \u2018superior\u2019 non-humans in the Red Hand\u2019s ranks and like he said, he\u2019d been with her from the start. He wasn\u2019t much for bloodshed or tactics, but Adrianna didn\u2019t need that. Harker was a good administrator and knew how to organize fleet dispositions, assignments and duty rosters quickly and capably. He also didn\u2019t buy into the messiah complex many of the more idealistic recruits ascribed to her. Whenever she built up too much of a head of steam, she could always count on him for a cold splash of water. But he was a product of the Compact. He bought into the system, even if he lived outside it. He wasn\u2019t \u2013 he\u2019d never be \u2013 ready to know about <i>Nemesis</i> and Red One.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOkay,\u201d Lucas said, sitting down in her chair. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know. But is there anything that I might want to? Might even <i>need</i> to?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI was going to call a general assembly of all ship leaders when we got back to Minos Perch. I didn\u2019t want to look like I was playing favourites, but you\u2019re right. You\u2019ve been with me the longest and you\u2019ve been there for me since the beginning. You deserve more.\u201d Adrianna gestured to the empty seat across from her. \u201cSit. I\u2019ll tell you about the shape of things to come.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Lucas arched an eyebrow. \u201cWith a little less drama?\u201d He grinned slightly.<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna smiled back. \u201cWith a little less drama.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Minos Perch\u2019s main war room was filled with Adrianna\u2019s seniormost leaders. She\u2019d summoned all her ships back from their operations for this meeting, ordering a full communications blackout. There had been some grumbling, mostly from the more piratical officers in her contingent, but they had obeyed. Outside of the <i>vassa anka</i>, discipline in the Red Hand was not quite up to military spec \u2013 but it was head and shoulders above almost any other Unbound cartel. Partly because her leaders had learned to trust her judgment and partly because they knew what happened to anyone who disobeyed the Red Queen without a <i>very</i> good reason.<br>", " <br>", "Over two dozen different species were represented here, all of them bragging, chatting, flirting, talking. Lucas waited at the head of the room; at one point it had been a general meeting room for the asteroid\u2019s miners, technicians and administrators. Slate-grey walls had been livened up with a handful of paintings \u2018collected\u2019 by various Red Hand troopers, the styles running from abstract cubism to vivid neo-realism.<br>", " <br>", "As ever, Adrianna was on-time for the meeting, her armsmen trailing behind her. Lucas had noted that fewer and fewer of the Red Hand\u2019s own leaders took to making their subordinates wait these days. The Red Queen took her place at the speaker\u2019s podium, one of her bodyguards standing behind her. Jhan moved the back of the room, where the Tribune could watch the assembled Unbound from a different angle. Everyone except for Lucas, Adrianna and her bodyguards had been stripped of their weapons in a \u2018random security screening\u2019. There was the usual grumbling about the queen\u2019s trust issues, but given that seven weeks ago one of Adrianna\u2019s subordinates had led a briefing where an argument between attendees had resulted in drawn weapons and two bullets in someone\u2019s torso, it was relatively restrained. Leblanc was not above ensuring that certain lessons sunk in.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThank you all for coming so quickly,\u201d Adrianna began. \u201cI know many of you had ongoing operations that you had to cut short. I\u2019ll make this as quick as possible so you can return to them. You\u2019ve heard the rumours by now. That we\u2019ve received a care package from some mysterious benefactor. While I won\u2019t be divulging the identity of our new associates, I felt you should all share in the good news and be informed of changes in our strategy. I\u2019ll be meeting with some of you over the next few days to go over your amended orders of battle and others in the coming weeks and months as things shake out.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThat\u2019s the general overview. Here\u2019s what you really want to hear: aside from the hardware we looted during Six Days, we have access to new types of munitions and supplies, thanks to our associates. We\u2019ll be slowly phasing these upgrades to all blooded Red Hand ships, starting with the <i>vassa anka</i>. It won\u2019t be quick \u2013 these will have be homegrown since we\u2019re not getting supply runs \u2013 and we have to make sure we\u2019ve got quality before starting mass production. But for those of you who\u2019ve proven yourselves \u2013 you can look forward to getting something special to play with.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "There was a rumble of approval at this.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSince we don\u2019t bankrupt ourselves, we\u2019ll be expanding our hunting operations. I know some of you have been pushing for this and some of you have been worried that we\u2019ll be spreading ourselves too thin. Until now, that was a very real danger.<br>", " <br>", " <br>", "Some of the intel we were passed indicates several weaknesses in cartels outside the Canyon. In particular, the Severed Dreams have gone through a recent bit of misfortune. They\u2019ve been trying to cover it up, but their commanders and major fleet assets were wiped out by an Compact anti-piracy initiative and what\u2019s left of their void-based and groundside operations are leaderless and disjointed. Leader Iivass,\u201d Adrianna looked over at the Prelate, the Xensiri woman\u2019s cracked-gemstone eyes staring blankly at her.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou\u2019ll take Strike Team Blue to Blackbag. I sent a courier ahead to Emmet\u2019ej. The Viral Lord will be expecting you and have personnel waiting. You\u2019ll take them outside the Canyon to Vien Sector and... negotiate with what\u2019s left of the Severed Dream. We will be taking control of their networks and assets. Any who want to join us as, can. If they resist \u2013 wipe them out. You\u2019ll be going in as the muscle to make sure the takeover goes well. The Memetic Virus have experience in rebuilding and streamlining smuggling lines, so they\u2019ll take lead on that front. Watch them, learn from them. Don\u2019t let them renegotiate terms. They get what I\u2019ve offered and I need to be impressed before they get anything else. You\u2019ll also be making a statement to the rest of the cartels in Vien Sector. Make sure that they realize that we are not to be fucked with. Find a way to make an example.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Iivass grinned toothily, approving of commander\u2019s bloody-mindedness.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe\u2019ve acquired a lot of financial data and interesting political tidbits,\u201d Adrianna continued. \u201cSome we can use for the coffers, some we\u2019re going to leak to the media and to our on-planet cells. I foresee a lot of embarrassed resignations and public apologies in the coming months.\u201d There were a few dark chuckles at this. \u201cWe\u2019ll be using the opportunity to move the people we\u2019ve groomed or co-opted into a lot of vacant seats. We\u2019ll help bury the naughty things they\u2019ve been doing to make them even more indebted to us. Once they\u2019re in place, we\u2019ll... advocate for a measure of understanding in both our military and our political operations. They\u2019ll ease off and our groundside operations will have an easier time. That breathing room will make the other cartels a little happier with us and that\u2019s never a bad thing.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou all know what to expect, what to do. Show initiative where you can. Hit the systems that try to crack down on our political allies harder, make it look like they\u2019re not accomplishing anything with all their feel-good laws and security measures. Ease up on territories that are taking a lighter approach to the demonstrators, but don\u2019t be too light on your treads.\u201d Adrianna saw a few gestures of understanding in the crowd, a few more expressions of indifference. The political wing of the Red Hand was, at the moment, a collection of loosely-aligned ideological parties. Most, like the Odegan Independence League, were informal, but a few actually had standing and representation in their respective systems. The Red Hand reached out to these organizations, supplying funding and assisting in networking. Some were radicalized and folded into the military wing of the cartel, others remained pacifistic, specifically so that they could denounce the acts of violence and pull ahead in public perception. Adrianna was always very careful to make sure that no trace of \u2018<i>azea haal</i>\u2019 could be found in her legitimate businesses and fronts. She was interested in ousting the Compact, not just turning the Magnameric Canyon red. The more embers there were, the more chance that the fire would catch.<br>", " <br>", "Her pirates and mercenaries complained about the money she shunted into these organizations, but never too loudly. They were making money here; more of it than they would than most other cartels... they just wanted even more. It was a tightrope, having to balance the needs of her cut-throats, the needs of her forces and the needs of the revolution. So far she was keeping her balance.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI wanted to bring you all up to date and let you know what to expect. I also wanted to stress that this information is not to circulate beyond this group here. I understand that there will be some leakage, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m happy about it. Security is our watchword now... especially since the information we acquired contained a list of Compact informants in the Red Hand and beyond. We\u2019ll be contacting the other cartels about this. For a... gesture of friendship,\u201d more low, rough laughter \u2013 the term was a common one in the fringe. It was payment for services rendered between two normally <i>u</i>nfriendly factions. \u201cWe\u2019ll be providing them with the names of their tattlers. I don\u2019t care what they do with them at that point.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "A hand came up, Group Leader Ar\u2019makata. When Adrianna\u2019s gaze turned on him, the slab-muscled officer spoke up. \u201cYou said the Red Hand was compromised,\u201d the Worker said. \u201cWho are the traitors?\u201d Gazes shifted sideways as men, women and other-gendered beings looked suspiciously at their compatriots.<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna smiled. She could always trust someone to ask the obvious question. \u201cThere are four. You needn\u2019t worry about three of them; they are known to me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve only ever been reporting what I wanted them to and the personnel I have watching them have done an excellent job in managing these individuals and their networks. They\u2019re not even here tonight. The fourth, though...\u201d She trailed off. \u201c<i>Is</i> here.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Another flurry of sideways glances.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSomeone in this room received seven payments of c10,000 over the last three years,\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cThose payments were deposited in secret bank accounts, made by a series of shell corporations that were traced back to the CST\u2019s intelligence branch. Contact between this person and known associates of CST intelligence was logged on three separate occasions. Further, while you\u2019ve been on Minos Perch, I had the individual\u2019s quarters on their ship searched. Hidden partitions on their personal computer drive were found with highly classified data on our operations and CMA code buried in the system to implicate other, loyal officers. It appears that this individual was feeding our operational data to the Compact for months and was planning on sending Minos Perch\u2019s location to Local Command. I am not happy.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Those last four words were like a physical shock. The last time their queen had said them, she had been addressing those who\u2019d betrayed her on Unicorn Set.<br>", " <br>", "<i>There were five of them. Hands tied behind their backs, they\u2019d been forced to kneel in front of her and behind each of them was one of her few remaining trusted soldiers, weapon drawn. The room was filled with as many of the rest of the Red Hand could fit in. The traitors were bloodied and bruised. Some had been in captivity for months, waiting until all of them could be brought together.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Adrianna didn\u2019t know what made her angrier; that there were so many, or this little cabal had been all it took to kill thousands of people. Three of them had run the instant she\u2019d set sail for her new base and the trap they\u2019d arranged. The other two had remained inside the Red Hand, ready and willing to continue their treachery under a new master. Or maybe they\u2019d planned to take power for themselves. Adrianna didn\u2019t care. She\u2019d found them all, no matter how far or fast they\u2019d run and her people had been given specific instructions: </i>I want them alive.<br>", " <br>", "<i>That was one of the grandiose, too-clever-by-half rules she swore she\u2019d never follow, but this was a special case. The Red Hand was almost dead on its feet. The remaining men and women were the ones she trusted the least. She needed to make them understand that she was not someone to cross, that there was no easy death after committing treachery. A knife across the throat, a shot in the back \u2013 those were simple, clean executions. She needed a statement.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>It began with three words.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cYou betrayed me,\u201d she said.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>One of them opened her mouth to speak, but Adrianna pre-empted whatever excuse the other woman was going to make. She gestured with one forefinger and the guard standing behind the traitor clubbed her with the butt of his pistol. The woman fell forward with a cry. \u201cYou don\u2019t speak right now,\u201d Adrianna told them. \u201cYou betrayed me. You betrayed the Red Hand. You betrayed your brothers and sisters in arms. I don\u2019t care why you did it. Some of you did it for money; I would have made you rich. Some did it because the Compact extorted you, pressured your families; I would have helped you. Some wanted to climb the ranks; if you\u2019d shown skill, I would have promoted you. Some of you did it because you just didn\u2019t like me; you should have just fucking </i>left<i>. Each of you had your reasons. None of them matter. You betrayed thousands of my people to death. Because of you, we lost ships, money and infrastructure. You\u2019ve set us back years. Your masters must be very pleased, very happy.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Adrianna\u2019s expression was hooded and dark. \u201cI, however.... </i>I<i> am not happy.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>She paused. \u201cI thought very long about how you were going to die. A bullet to the back of the head? Too simple. Hand you over to the crew, let them get some measure of revenge for all the comrades you lost? Too impersonal. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t even kill you. I should leave you as you left me. Buried alive. Bleeding and broken in the dark. Somewhere that you could scream for help all you wanted but no one would ever come for you.\u201d The pirate queen looked over at her captives. \u201cThat was tempting. It still is. But I made my decision. You can never pay the blood debt you owe, but this will be some small measure of atonement for your sins.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Adrianna crouched in front of the leader, Hnan. He was glaring at her with utter contempt, but she could see the fear in each of his four eyes. \u201cAs the Compact likes to remind us, my people are </i>not<i> civilized like you,\u201d she said, lowering her voice so that her audience had to strain to hear her. \u201cWe are primitive, superstitious beings. Some of us even still believe in, and pray to a deity. Can you imagine?\u201d She ran her tongue over her lips and leaned in. \u201cDo you know what crucifixion is?\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Hnan lunged at her, but his guard shoved him to the ground, pushing the barrel of his gun into the Tribune\u2019s head. Adrianna didn\u2019t move an inch. She straightened slowly, nodding to someone in the crowd. The captives turned, mouths agape as a pair of Red Hand ratings came forward, one of them carrying five EVA suits.... and the other had in each hand, a meter-long hull rivet.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cThey say that you can\u2019t look directly into shockspace,\u201d the human said idly. \u201cThat it\u2019s inherently incomprehensible to an organic mind.... but the thing is, the brain keeps trying. It keeps trying to force it to make sense and it </i>can\u2019t<i>. It just can\u2019t. But it just keeps on trying until it destroys itself in the attempt. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. It\u2019s probably just an old spacer\u2019s tale... but you five are going to find out.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>She touched her wrist, right above the tarsal bones. \u201cAn important thing to remember is that the stakes go through here. You see, they\u2019re often depicted as being put through the palms, but you put them through there, the weight of your body tears them out, right through your hands. If that happens, you might come loose.\u201d She laughed. \u201cAnd that would just be embarrassing, to go through all that trouble to get up on the hull and then \u2013 whoops! \u2013 you just slide right off.\u201d She looked into five sets of horrified, angry eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, though. The suits will seal around the breach, so you don\u2019t have to worry about decompression killing you. You\u2019ll stay out there for days, screaming at nothing until your minds shatter. And,\u201d she laughed again, even darker than before. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing... everyone who sees this ship from now on... they\u2019ll remember what happens to people that turn on me. The next time someone comes to them with an offer, they\u2019re going to think back to this moment. They\u2019ll remember that I survived. That I found each and every one of the last set of people who betrayed me and then I made them </i>atone<i> for what they did.\u201d She smiled thinly, like a knife\u2019s edge. \u201c<i>Now</i> you can speak.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Ignoring the threats, imprecations, apologies and pleas for mercy, the Red Queen turned from her captives to her crew. \u201cTake them.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Still sobbing and screaming, the five traitors were dragged away.</i><br>", " <br>", "The room suddenly got very quiet as their queen\u2019s gaze drifted across each officer, her fingers brushing along the leather strap holding her pistol in its holster. She didn\u2019t need augmented senses to pick out the increase in tension. When she finally spoke, at least one heart skipped a beat.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSabisca.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "All eyes turned towards the woman whose name Adrianna had just spoken. Leader Sabisca Can-dai. The Yttrian stood on shaking legs, those sitting next to her moving away. They didn\u2019t even try to be subtle about it.<br>", " <br>", "When Adrianna spoke again, her voice was soft and almost gentle. \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI... I needed the money. I\u2019m sorry, please.. I-I needed-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna snapped her fingers. The pirate queen had never seen a Tribune move as quickly or as quietly as Jahn and the armsman was suddenly behind Can-dai. In one swift movement, he swept a clear bag over her head, pulling it tight as he hauled her up off the ground. She was almost a hundred and seventy pounds and the Tribune hoisted her like she weighed nothing at all. Sabisca shouted and kicked, clawing at Jahn\u2019s arms, but his skin was too thick for her claws to do much more then scratch. The armsman was grinning darkly as the Yttrian thrashed in his grip, unable break free and rapidly running out of oxygen.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI dislike being lied to,\u201d Adrianna said to the struggling Didact. \u201cI like it even less when it\u2019s done with disrespect. You did not \u2018need the money\u2019. You are Pack Leader Ginhara Ol-ema of the Compact Intelligence Services. Sabisca is a construct. Her family does not exist. Her ailing mother, for whom she needs large sums of money for expensive treatment, is a fiction. It was a good cover; I commend you. You played the role well. I was completely taken in by the depth of your performance. But the stage lights are going out, Ginhara. The orchestra has retired, the audience is anxious to return home and the play is over. It\u2019s time for you to take your last bow.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Ginhara was trying to speak, but whether to plea for her life or curse Adrianna was immaterial \u2013 she could barely breathe now, the inside of the bag fogged with her last, desperate gasps for air. Finally, her reddened eyes glazed over and she went limp. Jahn held her there for several moments longer, then let go. The Yttrian\u2019s body fell bonelessly to the ground, blank eyes staring at nothing, a swollen tongue hanging from her mouth.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThere was no Sabisca Can-dai,\u201d Adrianna informed her subordinates. \u201cGroup Leader Korvak; you are now and always have been <i>Nightbloom\u2019s</i> leader. If your crew inquires about such a person, inform them that they must be mistaken. Neither you, nor any of the people here, know of such a person because there is, was and never has been anyone with that name here.\u201d The Steersman bobbed his head in an approximation of a human nod.<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna didn\u2019t spare another glance at the pack leader\u2019s body. \u201cA new age is coming for us, for the Magnameric Canyon and for everyone under the Compact\u2019s boot. It won\u2019t be easily forged. It won\u2019t be quick. It will be painful. It will be hard. It will be bloody. A lot of people will die and many of you will be among them. I don\u2019t begrudge those who walk away. I do take issue with treachery and betrayal. Each of you will at some point ask yourselves if this is the path you want. Choose wisely.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThose who fight with us will be rewarded, whether they desire riches, power or the simple right of freedom that all sapient beings deserve. Those who choose to stand against us won\u2019t even be remembered.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "There was a prolonged silence in the chamber and then one of the younger officers stood. He was from the Magnameric Canyon, one of the firebrands who\u2019d grown tired of the Compact\u2019s iron rule. \u201cForgive me, matron... but you make it sound like we\u2019re going to war.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe\u2019ve always been at war, Dromos,\u201d Adrianna replied. \u201cBut now...\u201d she smiled and the fire in her eyes was brighter than ever. \u201c<i>Nemesis</i> rises... and fate is with us.\u201d</div>"]}

She was resting on the couch, looking out at the stars. Several of them were not actually stars; they were the ships of her armada. The pirate queen focused on one speck in particular. <i>Rakshasi</i>, Adrianna thought. Seven months ago, it had been the destroyer <i>Stonehewer</i>, just as her <i>Naamah</i> had once been <i>Unwavering Strike</i>. She smiled; her Red Hand was getting very good at boarding operations. <i>Rakshasi</i> and <i>Naamah</i> were the only \u2018true\u2019 warships they\u2019d taken, but they\u2019d also seized several military transports and three attack ships from various mercenary bands. Those corvettes were now <i>Lamashtu</i>, <i>Empusa</i> and <i>Yuki-Onna</i>. The clan called these vessels the <i>vassa anka</i>; \u2018the flayed ones\u2019. A reference to a Tribune story of shapeshifters that hollowed out their prey, leaving only the skin to walk and talk, inhabited by something altogether more malign.<br>", " <br>", "She liked that.<br>", " <br>", "The doors to the observation deck opened. Though she gave no sign that she\u2019d heard the visitor, she tracked their approach, augmented senses easily detecting the soft tread of their feet, the sound of the air rustling through their lungs and even the distinctive <i>lub-dub</i> of the heart beating in their chest. She smiled without turning around. \u201cLucas.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI\u2019ll never get used to that,\u201d her second said as he came to stand beside her. A moment passed. \u201cYou have your comm turned off.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI wanted some quiet,\u201d Adrianna answered. \u201cYou have something?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe\u2019ve received the signal. The Voltaic Orbs have arrived.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cFashionably late, as usual.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Harker nodded. \u201cThat gives us twenty-two ships. We\u2019ll have enough.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201c\u2018Enough\u2019 isn\u2019t enough,\u201d Adrianna snapped. \u201cIf all I wanted is firepower, then I\u2019d just use the Red Hand. This is supposed to be a spectacle. Spectacles aren\u2019t that impressive if half of the participants get vapourized.\u201d The woman paused, running a hand through her blue hair. It hung down past her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lucas. I shouldn\u2019t bite your head off.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBetter you than anyone else,\u201d the older man said with a smile. \u201cThat turn of phrase was more literal than figurative in some of the places I worked before the Red Hand.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna nodded. \u201cTwenty-two ships...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019ll be enough,\u201d Lucas assured her. \u201cGetting that many vessels from half a dozen different clans who all hate each other is no minor feat in itself. I\u2019m impressed no one\u2019s tried to attack anyone else yet.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI asked twice as many cartels to contribute,\u201d Adrianna replied bitterly. \u201cNo matter what I do, it\u2019s not enough. I take control of the Cursed Red Gauntlets and suddenly Vuld, a man half this spiral arm was afraid of, was a weakling and a fool. I build the Red Hand into one of the most effective Unbound clans in the region and it\u2019s because there\u2019s no real competition. I come back from the dead and it\u2019s because the Compact doesn\u2019t try hard enough. I take a warship out from under the Space Force\u2019s nose and the security was lax. I\u2019m getting sick of it. Every success I plan, every victory we claim and there\u2019s a reason why a <i>Broken</i> was able to do it and no one else could.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou set the Magnameric Canyon on fire,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cA hundred worlds are rioting.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cA hundred worlds are experiencing <i>unrest</i>,\u201d Adrianna corrected. The plan for Operation Young Turk was still proceeding; this mission was a part of that. \u201cThat\u2019s a far cry from wholesale rebellion.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s more than any other clan\u2019s done,\u201d the other human pointed out. \u201cThe Everlasting Gloaming and Waiting Noose had hunting rights to the Canyon for over a century. In all that time, they didn\u2019t do half as much as we have.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAnd that only gets my foot in the door,\u201d the pirate queen observed. She exhaled sharply. \u201cIf I had enough ships of my own, I wouldn\u2019t even be here, indulging in this bullshit. We could hit the convoy ourselves, then be back in the Canyon, fanning those flames. Instead, we have to coddle pirates, deserters and smugglers who don\u2019t give one fuck about the cause. The ships they\u2019ve sent are a fucking <i>insult</i>, just so they can hedge their bets. If we fail, they haven\u2019t lost much of anything and get to say that they only contributed to see how completely I could fuck things up. If this goes off... well, then they\u2019ve always believed in me and the Red Hand.\u201d She let out another breath, even angrier than before. \u201cAnd I have to thank them for the privilege.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Lucas said nothing at first. Many Unbound claimed to have an ideology or a cause that they believed in, but very few did more than offer lip service to those beliefs, as much a criminal cartel as the rest of their fringer brethren. The Red Hand were one of the few exceptions. There were still many who flocked to \u2018<i>azea haal\u2019s</i>\u2019 banner out of greed, but there were far more who\u2019d heard about the Red Queen and dared to hope that even a tenth of the stories about her were true. That she didn\u2019t just fight for wealth and power, but that she actually stood for something. It was this belief that made the bounty on her head one of the highest ever offered. Her agents, demagogues and provocateurs spurred unrest and resentment among the client races as her military raids highlighted the weakness, hypocrisy and uselessness of the Compact.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThis coddling will keep the other cartels off our backs as we expand,\u201d Harker commented. \u201cIt\u2019ll convince them that we\u2019re better as allies than as enemies. It will make them realize that you\u2019re someone that they can do business with.\u201d He knew he was parroting Adrianna\u2019s own words back at her, but he could guess what was really bothering her. It wasn\u2019t just the habitual rudeness of the other Unbound lords and ladies or the setbacks they were having with Young Turk. Adrianna had never mentioned it to him, but he\u2019d seen a news dispatch on her desk.<br>", " <br>", "The Compact had just raised a new regiment from Rally, the 1118th Volunteers. Among them was Pack Leader Samuel Kevin Chiron, one of Adrianna\u2019s cousins. The 1118th was going to be deployed to the Magnameric Canyon to \u2018assist in local peacekeeping efforts\u2019. Someone in Force Command had a sick sense of humour.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI know,\u201d the young woman said with a nod. \u201cI know.

The room was a riot of colour and fashion, as if each of the Unbound present were trying to outdo each other in the pomposity, garishness and impracticality of their outfits. The cartels that had responded to Adrianna\u2019s overtures might indeed be hedging their bets, but knowing that the others would be here was a chance to flaunt their own wealth and power over their rivals. The conference room was abuzz with noise, a half dozen different languages and twice that many dialects as the pirates argued, gossiped, bartered with and threatened one another. None of them paid much attention to the time, fully expecting the human to abide by the unspoken rules of protocol and force them to wait. The less self-aware of the group sneered in condescension, wondering aloud if the Red Queen was so petty as to make the guests she\u2019d invited cool their heels.<br>", " <br>", "They did not, in fact have to wait.<br>", " <br>", "Contrasting sharply with the many different styles on display, the Red Hand\u2019s queen wore a simple black outfit, cut and styled in a military fashion, but without the overdone epaulettes, custom rank insignia and decals that many of her counterparts bedecked themselves with. Her concessions to vanity were few: a stylized bloody handprint on her left breast and small flame pattern at her cuffs and waist. When she entered the room, the conversation slowly began to die away until the assembled pirates were silent, waiting for their hostess to speak.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou know who I am,\u201d Leblanc said without preamble. \u201cYou know each other. Now that we\u2019ve been introduced, it\u2019s time to get down to business. Everyone\u2019s here who\u2019s coming, so we\u2019re moving ahead as planned.\u201d There was a stir at these words. They wanted more ships. Adrianna ignored the murmurs. \u201cWe received word from our agents in Harseen\u2019s operations \u2013 the convoy moved out as scheduled, but the guilders are nervous \u2013 it\u2019s possible someone from your organizations, or one of the cartels who chose not to participate, leaked the information-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201c<i>Our</i> organizations?\u201d Group Leader Banh (and two names besides) interrupted. \u201cHow do we know it wasn\u2019t one of yours?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna blinked slowly, meeting the Tribune\u2019s cybernetic eyes. \u201cThere are two types of people who serve in the Red Hand,\u201d she said. \u201cThose who believe so fully in our cause that they would never betray us and those who remember what I did to the traitors who told the Compact about Unicorn Set. Does that answer satisfy you, or shall I prepare a detailed briefing on my counter-intelligence operations?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Banh sneered, but did not object further. \u201cAs I was saying,\u201d Adrianna continued, \u201cThe guilders are nervous and they\u2019ve added to the escort\u2019s strength. Our sources indicate a further two support ships, although we were unable to discern weight and class.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "That provoked another, stronger series of murmurs. \u201cTheir presence is irrelevant,\u201d the human said firmly. \u201cThey\u2019d have to be exceptionally powerful to offset <i>Naamah</i>\u2019s presence, in which case we break and run as planned for. If they\u2019re not, then they can\u2019t affect the outcome.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThat is an easy thing to say when you are sitting behind the screens of your own heavy cruiser,\u201d another Unbound spoke up to several affirming comments and gestures. \u201cFor the rest of us, it may be a greater source of disquiet.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna\u2019s expression remained carefully neutral as she stared back at the Judiciary. \u201cYour concerns were already addressed. I explained the mission parameters to your lord. This mission will be dangerous, but it will be very lucrative. If you are unwilling to fulfill your obligations because something we anticipated might happen happened, you can return to the Weeping Knives and explain it to your lord yourself. Or if you like, Leader Septees, before the mission I can put on a skirt,\u201d the corner\u2019s of Adrianna\u2019s mouth curled upwards. \u201cSo that you can cower behind it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Judiciary\u2019s jaw clicked shut, his secondary arms folding across his chest as several of his colleagues sent jeers his way.<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna waited a moment for the catcalls to die down. \u201cIf we\u2019re done with the interruptions, I can continue with the mission briefing for Operation Six Days. We\u2019ll be carrying out a standard spider-hole ambush but with the following changes....\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cMultiple synchronized shockpoints,\u201d Scopes reported. \u201cDefinitely a mass emergence.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna was slouched in her throne, a perfect picture of arrogance and command. \u201cShip count?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cStill sorting through signals,\u201d Sensors replied. \u201cCounting...twenty drive wakes, I think.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cFourteen transports and the security force,\u201d Lucas mused aloud. He was on his feet, moving around the prime\u2019s pulpit, checking each station in turn.<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna remained where she was, sprawled in her throne. Her fingers tapped on the control panels in the arms, bringing up each officer\u2019s information to her. She wished she could do more, but her cybernetics didn\u2019t allow her to interface with external systems. \u201cWeight of the proctors?\u201d she demanded.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cFive escort-class. Wait one. One of the drive signatures is different. It could be a heavy destroyer, or-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s a cruiser,\u201d Adrianna cut her augur operator off. \u201cProbably the <i>Chastening Hand</i>. Group Leader Harim is good at hunting outlaws.\u201d She grinned savagely, leaning forward in her chair. \u201cComm our allies and make sure they\u2019ve still got clean pants. Shift the fleet\u2019s attack pattern to Yellow Two.\u201d She\u2019d kept the options few and simple; most Unbound were commensurate killers, but that was all they were \u2013 murderers. Not soldiers. In fact, if her <i>vassa anka</i> hadn\u2019t been present, those five Compact ships would have outgunned the entirety of the pirate force. \u201c<i>Naamah</i> will take the cruiser.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "They called her their greatest shame. The savage who\u2019d murdered one of her betters, who\u2019d had the audacity to stand before them and tell them that <i>he\u2019d deserved it</i>. You didn\u2019t say those things, not on Rally. Not of their \u2018saviours\u2019 in the Compact. You certainly didn\u2019t <i>kill</i> a Tribune. Even a criminal. No, you sat there and took it when some sneering, swaggering scum tried to extort and threaten your family. You let the authorities handle it, the same authorities who ate at the same restaurants, played the same games of <i>veldt</i> and laughed at the same jokes as that man. That was what you did.<br>", " <br>", "You didn\u2019t use the skills you\u2019d learned sitting at your father\u2019s knee to put a bomb on that criminal\u2019s car and when he laughed at you when you called him and told him to leave your family alone, you didn\u2019t send his superior ass to Hell in seven different directions.<br>", " <br>", "Seventeen-year old Adrianna Leblanc had watched the burning husk of that limousine and felt something she\u2019d never felt before. Twenty years later and she still remembered that warmth. It came to her every time she saw a Compact warship burning against the stars.<br>", " <br>", "\u201c<i>Chastening Hand</i> is crippled,\u201d Tactical reported, confirming what the pirate queen already knew.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBoarding teams are ready,\u201d Operations piped up.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSend them after the transports as we planned,\u201d Adrianna ordered. Her eyes never left the cratered, smouldering wreck of the smaller cruiser she\u2019d cut down. Harim was a good tactician \u2013 he\u2019d known he could never take <i>Naamah</i> alone, but he could inflict grievous damage on the rest of the Unbound. He\u2019d focused on them, forcing Adrianna to shift to fleet defence instead of protecting herself. When <i>Chastening Hand</i> had suddenly shifted targeting and thrown everything at the heavy cruiser, he almost took her by surprise, which could have meant a badly damaged or even crippled <i>Naamah</i>...<br>", " <br>", "...but \u2018almost\u2019 wasn\u2019t enough.<br>", " <br>", "A few heads turned towards her. <i>Chastening Hand</i> was ready for the taking; the longer they waited, the more time the surviving Compact crew had to dig in, to prepare for boarders and to ready the vessel\u2019s self-destruct. She did want the ship, but she needed the convoy\u2019s cargo more. \u201cSend a message to Group Leader Harim,\u201d she said. \u201cCongratulate him on a battle well fought. Tell him that I know that Local Command has mentioned severe consequences for the next leader who loses their ship to me. Tell him also that if he doesn\u2019t abandon ship, I\u2019ll open fire until I know everyone aboard is dead and then salvage the hulk. If he wants to avoid that, there will be no living soul left on that ship in fifteen minutes.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBe sure to tell him that he can wipe his databases, but if I find any sabotage aboard the vessel, I will kill him. Him, his crew and the survivors of this convoy.\u201d Adrianna\u2019s blue gaze hardened. \u201cBe sure he\u2019s aware that if he chooses to destroy his ship, I will make sure everyone in the Canyon knows that he chose his pride over the lives of tens of thousands. Let him wonder how that will play in a sector already rioting over the Compact\u2019s injustices.\u201d Adrianna turned away, looking to the tactical hologram and the drifting, bleeding wrecks of the convoy. \u201cNow, let\u2019s collect our due.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Lucas handed Adrianna a \u2018scroll. \u201cFinal tallies.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The woman accepted it, keying through the information. \u201cWhat\u2019s the damage?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cVery little. <i>Rakshasi</i>\u2019s hits aren\u2019t as bad as they seemed at the time. We can make good almost everything at Minos Perch and if we need to, visit Blackbag for the rest.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna gritted her teeth. The destroyer had been engaged by one of the Compact escorts and had briefly lost power, leaving <i>Naamah</i>\u2019s flank dangerously unprotected. <i>Rakshasi</i>\u2019s power grid had been finicky ever since they took the ship, but this was the first time it had affected the destroyer\u2019s performance in combat. \u201cTell Leader Kuumal that if Faithful Loovan can\u2019t do what he promised, then I\u2019m going to find <i>Rakshasi</i> an engineer who <i>can</i>,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cIf Kuumal or Loovan send one of my ships into battle like this again, it will be the <i>last</i> time it happens.\u201d Leblanc looked over the rest of her damage; there was very little. Surprise and overwhelming firepower had done much to hamper the convoy\u2019s proctors. Even her allies had taken fewer losses than she\u2019d feared. The spectacle had gone off nicely, it seemed.<br>", " <br>", "The prizes, though \u2013 twelve of the transports were still salvageable, two having been the victims of over-enthusiastic gunners from the Sacrificers of the Young and Blackened Soles. Most of the freighters had struck their colours the instant that <i>Chastening Hand</i> was turned into a wreck. The others had needed only a little encouragement. One of the Compact escorts had disengaged after the cruiser had fallen, a second had been broken in half by <i>Naamah</i>\u2019s guns, a third torn to piece by the frenzied Unbound attack and the other two had been hulked by the <i>vassa anka</i> and the other Unbound. In fact, the pirates were squabbling over them right now. Adrianna had no interest in those ships; her allies could consider them an unexpected bonus.<br>", " <br>", "Now it was time to divide the spoils. Adrianna had claimed 4 of the ships for herself. There had been some grumbling over that \u2013 more pronounced now that the others\u2019 share had dropped from 10 hulls to 8 \u2013 but the Red Hand had organized this ambush, planned it, executed it and expended more resources and munitions than the others. \u201cWhat do we have here?\u201d Adrianna said, thumbing through the manifests the defeated transport leaders had sent over.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s just what you thought,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cThey were hoping that we either wouldn\u2019t notice or wouldn\u2019t hit a convoy this big.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have without the other cartels,\u201d Adrianna acknowledged. \u201cNot without taking so much damage that we\u2019d be lucky to break even.\u201d The Red Hand, if nothing else, was known for its defiance of established Unbound doctrines. They\u2019d hit three military transports in the Magnameric Canyon in the last year alone, destroying two of them outright, forcing both local military and commercial interests to rely on the convoy system to protect themselves from the raids. With that had come the predictable slowing of the movement of cargo throughout the region. Shortages of luxury and high-value goods were already occurring on a handful of worlds. It wasn\u2019t austerity measures by any means, but it was getting there.<br>", " <br>", "It had been Local Command\u2019s hope that using the Harseen Transport Consortium\u2019s ships to move munitions and supplies to the \u2018peacekeeping\u2019 forces would keep them safe from the Red Hand\u2019s predation. It might have worked: with most of the few ships the Red Hand had spread throughout the Canyon, all Adrianna had had available were her <i>vassa anka</i>.<br>", " <br>", "With the increased reliance on convoys came the increased protection from Unbound attack. The other cartels resented the Red Hand for the loss of hijacking opportunities. Normally Adrianna wouldn\u2019t have cared, but she was trying to be more diplomatic, as Emmet\u2019ej had suggested. That was why she\u2019d approached the other cartels with this plan \u2013 they provided support for her heavier ships and she provided the firepower needed to break the convoy\u2019s escorts. If it had just been her <i>vassa anka</i>, the proctor ships could have marshalled themselves against her. She had <i>Naamah</i> and <i>Rakshasi</i> and her trio of mercenary corvettes, but the escort had had five actual warships.<br>", " <br>", "Fighting on even terms was a bad idea even for a military commander; for someone whose profit margins mean the difference between life and death, it was even worse. Fortunately, she\u2019d managed to deliver what she promised. The cartels might quibble over their shares, but they had made decent profits from this venture. And what did she have?<br>", " <br>", "She had another step towards an uprising... and she had <i>Harseen Ubiqqen</i> and its seventeen million tonnes of ammunition, weaponry and personal armour once destined for the Ground Force and CST Security Force units in the Magnameric Canyon. \u201c<i>Ubiqqen</i> is ours,\u201d she told Lucas. \u201cWe\u2019ll also take the <i>Harseen Garibeadian</i>, <i>Harseen Ironmaker</i> and <i>Harseen Senharim</i>. Ransom the ships and crews back to the company. Keep the cargo; we\u2019ll get more for it on the black market. We\u2019ll offload it at Blackbag and then head to the perch.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAnd <i>Chastening Hand</i>? Have you got a name picked out for it yet?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna sighed. \u201cScrap pile #17.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Lucas blinked. \u201cI thought-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI know. I want to salvage it too, but we can\u2019t. We don\u2019t have the crew for it and we can\u2019t afford it.\u201d Adrianna stroked the bulkhead. \u201cYou know how much <i>Naamah</i> costs to operate.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "McEnroy nodded. Keeping the heavy cruiser at full capability was one of the Red Hand\u2019s largest expenses. Even the largest Unbound cartels would be hard-pressed to run more than one capital ship at a time. \u201cSo what do you want to do?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe\u2019ll take it under tow. Once we\u2019re clear from the system, send Juum-ope-cand over to inventory what\u2019s there. We\u2019ll take everything we need from it and either sell the hulk to another cartel or keep it for whatever comes up. Now,\u201d Adrianna handed the \u2018scroll back to her second in command. \u201cSend out the prize crews and get the ships ready to move out. Operation Six Days is finished.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cSo,\u201d Vuld rumbled deep in his throat as he looked down at the human. The Broken had a leash around her neck. A pair of his soldiers flanked the smaller creature, looking at it with anger and contempt.

He\u2019d never seen one in the flesh before. Gods, she was an ugly thing. A face almost as flat as a Thoughtful\u2019s, with two eyes. Instead of the normal single hue, they were a mixture of white sclera and blue irises. \u201cLeave us,\u201d the Unbound lord ordered his men. He took the leash from Gahein, pulling the human along as he marched back to his throne, slouching into it and pouring a goblet of wine for himself. \u201cSo tell me,\u201d he mused, taking a gulp. \u201cHow did you kill two of my men?\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cI rigged the room to explode,\u201d she answered, glaring back at him.

Her heart was pounding and her skin was covered in cold, clammy sweat. <i>Just a dream</i>, she told herself, setting the weapon back down. <i>Just a dream.</i> But it was worse than a dream, wasn\u2019t it? A dream was something you were afraid of, something you wanted, something that wasn\u2019t real \u2013 that had <i>never</i> been real.

She was <i>alone</i>. Her skin was still crawling, as if she could still feel his hands on her. Those were her dreams now: memories. They were almost always ugly ones. The jeering crowds as she was led to the courthouse. Being surrounded by the other prisoners. The trial \u2013 the verdict and sentencing. Vuld. Those she could handle. Those gave her purpose, a focus for her anger.<br>", " <br>", "Sometimes, only sometimes, she had the worst dreams of all. The scent of her mother\u2019s hair. The smile on her father\u2019s face as he sat her on his knee and showed her how to make things work. The sound of waves on Homestead Beach from the day they\u2019d picnicked there and her mother taught her how to fly a kite. The warm summer rain as she ran and shrieked and whooped through it, her father scooping her up in his arms, holding her close. Those dreams ended in the worst possible way. They didn\u2019t fade into horror, into burning corpses or judgemental faces, blood or fire \u2013 they just ended, like every other dream.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI killed you,\u201d Adrianna said into the silence, still holding herself. She felt dirty. \u201cI <i>killed</i> you.\u201d She pushed the feelings of fear and powerlessness away, clutching instead to other emotions. The warmth she\u2019d felt as she watched that limousine burn. The satisfaction of seeing Vuld\u2019s eyes going dim as his ruined heart beat its last, her hand deep in his chest. She remembered the words she\u2019d spoken once before. \u201cThe killing will never stop,\u201d she said quietly.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cPreparing for emergence,\u201d Navigation commented. \u201cT-minus three minutes.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Leblanc nodded. She was looking forward to some down time \u2013 such as it was. She\u2019d offloaded all the crews, four of the prize ships and their cargo on Blackbag. Emmet\u2019ej would handle the ransoms ships and crew as well as the fencing of the cargo. The Viral Lord preferred such \u2018clean\u2019 businesses and handled them very efficiently. The Red Hand was better at the messier side of things. Adrianna was learning about the former \u2013 but she didn\u2019t have the connections that Emmet\u2019ej did. As he\u2019d pointed out, the Red Hand\u2019s reputation often preceded them. Not always for the better. It was easier (and more profitable) to allow the Thoughtful to handle those deals, even with the extra skim that she knew he indulged himself in. At least until her own network was the equal of his \u2013 or she had to kill him.<br>", " <br>", "The Memetic Virus was not a militarily strong cartel; their influence was in soft power and their network of contacts. Losing that would be a blow, but a survivable one. By the same token, Emmet\u2019ej and the rest of his Unbound had grown into the vacuum created by Adrianna\u2019s decapitation of the Everlasting Gloaming and the Waiting Noose. The Red Hand\u2019s raids brought them a lot of money and power. For the moment, the two factions were in a commensal relationship.<br>", " <br>", "For the moment.<br>", " <br>", "The other cartels were slightly more predisposed towards her now as they hauled their riches back to their own lairs. Several had already expressed interest in purchasing <i>Chastening Hand</i>, if only to because a mere human had a heavy cruiser and it offended their sense of propriety. Well, whoever wanted it enough to pay for it could have it. A fool and his money...<br>", " <br>", "All in all, it had been a good excursion.<br>", " <br>", "But she was tired. She felt like she could sleep for days.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cShocking into Minos Perch now,\u201d Navigation reported. <i>Naamah</i> shivered, millions of tonnes of metal punching its way out of one dimension and into another.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSystems stabilizing,\u201d Operations noted. \u201cETA five minutes to full capability.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThe other ships have emerged on our fifteen,\u201d Scopes informed Leblanc. \u201cAll of the <i>vassa anka</i> accounted for.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna nodded, her eyes on the distant speck of Minos Perch, her new base of operations. It was a long-abandoned asteroid mining facility. The company that had built it had gone bankrupt three hundred years ago and none of their creditors had ever stepped forward to claim it \u2013 it had gotten lost amidst the paperwork of their financial collapse. The galaxy was full of little secrets like these. You just had to know where to look.<br>", " <br>", "The woman stood, stretching her legs. Minos Perch was in orbit of one of this nameless system\u2019s outermost unremarkable gas giants, but it was still a sixteen-hour slog to get there from the outer shock limit.<br>", " <br>", "A handful of minutes passed as the Unbound ships headed towards their base, spreading out into a defensive envelope. She\u2019d learned from Unicorn Set \u2013 safe wasn\u2019t always safe. A point driven home as <i>Naamah</i> was suddenly hit by a powerful active augur, unknown source.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBattle stations!\u201d Adrianna snarled, the woman coming out of her chair. \u201cDeploy drones in a Slice-Five pattern. I want the source of that scan in my sights.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIncoming signal,\u201d Communications reported. \u201cUnknown source, like the augur \u2013 it\u2019s...\u201d She frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s a data burst. Bringing it up now...\u201d her frown deepened, the Didact\u2019s tail twitching. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cLet me see,\u201d Adrianna said, stepping over to the Scope officer\u2019s station. She looked over the incoming message, one eyebrow raising. \u201cWell,\u201d she said to herself, ignoring her officer\u2019s confusion. \u201cThat\u2019s unexpected.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>Naamah</i>\u2019s secondary launch bay had been evacuated. All recording devices had been shut off, all security cameras deactivated. There would be no record of what happened here. Adrianna waited in the airless bay as the does opened fully, a breathing mask over her face. Since her reconstruction, she was a lot less vulnerable to vacuum, but she didn\u2019t enjoy exposure to it. She grinned at another warm memory. <i>As I recall, neither did Voaml... but fair was fair, since he blew me out into space first. I just returned the favour.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Through the transparent metal window of the airlock door, she could see him, laughing as he trudged back up the corridor, already thinking she was dead. Warning messages flashed across her HUD and she dismissed them with a thought. She was braced against the side of the station, the magnetics in her boots keeping her from drifting into space. She\u2019d come here to parley for trading rights and instead the treacherous Ar\u2019densai bastard depressurized the entire section, sending her and her escort into space. She\u2019d managed to get enough of a handhold for her magnetics to anchor her, but her escorts hadn\u2019t been as lucky. She didn\u2019t know what Voaml was thinking, who\u2019s orders he was following, but that didn\u2019t matter right now.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>The airlock was sealed; even with her augmented strength, she\u2019d never be able to force it open. Luckily, she didn\u2019t need to. She still had her weapons. Why not? What good would a pistol and a sword do to someone choking on nothing?</i><br>", " <br>", "Let me show you.<br>", " <br>", "<i>She slammed her fist against the door, hard enough that the sound carried through the hull. Voaml paused, turning around. The Worker\u2019s eyes widened in shock as he saw Adrianna, the surprise turning to fear as she raised her khopesh and thumbed the activation stud. The baleblade\u2019s disruption field flared to life and she rammed it through the door, the metal melting and bubbling as she sawed through the airlock, shoving the door inward and climbing inside. Voaml was shouting into his comm, gesturing for his guards to shoot her, but the inner door was too thick for their bullets. She cut into the bulkhead, exposing the manual release for the second door and pulled on it. The doors opened with a gust of atmosphere, the woman driving her blade into the release mechanism and jamming it open. No one could shut it again.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>She braced herself against the gale, flat against the wall as the first of the enemy guards lost his footing and fell into the stars. The second followed a moment later. Voaml himself had managed a handhold, the Worker\u2019s prodigious strength keeping him in place. Decompression doors had sealed, isolating this section. With the airlock still open, the only way out was the elevator at the end of the hallway... and it would only open for the person holding Voaml\u2019s rank cylinder. He realized this a few seconds after Adrianna did, thumping and bouncing his way to salvation as she bounded after him, the Ar\u2019densai wheezing on nothing as his body cried out for air.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>He was a third of the way to the elevator before she pounced on him, wrapping her arms around his throat. He roared silently, instinctively trying to rear back and crush her against the wall, but he lost his footing and slipped. Desperate, he crawled towards the elevator, his tongue hanging out of his mouth, his eyes bulging and turning red as capillaries burst inside them. Finally, he stopped moving and Adrianna climbed off him, snagging his code cylinder and opening the security doors. Precious air rushed into her lungs, the sweetest thing she\u2019d ever known...</i><br>", " <br>", "The drone slid into the bay. It was a sleek gull-winged thing with a narrow hull and forward-swept radiator fins. It was almost Compact standard, but it had been modified extensively. <i>Waste not, want not</i>, Adrianna thought with a smile. She stepped over to the drone\u2019s main hatch and opened it. Inside was the access point for the automaton\u2019s data core. Instead of instructions for downloading information, the small screen had a different message:<br>", " <br>", "+we need to talk+<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna stared at the message for a long moment and then she smiled, suddenly no longer tired at all.</div>"]}

I'm still working on the next chapter. In the meantime, we have another excerpt from <i>Angel's Fire</i>, which puts us half-way through.<br>", " <br>", " <br>", "<b>Pt 2:<b> Rising Flames</b></b><br>", " <br>", "Lucas Harker leaned over the conference table, craning his neck to look his counterpart in the eye. \u201cNo.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Yndol Sur Amis laughed, his lips pulling back from a mouth full of sharp, white teeth. None of them were the originals, but the work was good \u2013 there was no indication that each tooth had been broken at least once. \u201cAre you that loyal to a corpse?\u201d the Tribune asked with feigned incredulity, but Harker could see the anger boiling behind the Tribune\u2019s upper eyes. His lower, larger daylight eyes were impossible to read, not since they had been ritually blinded upon his exile.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe don\u2019t know that she\u2019s dead,\u201d Lucas retorted.<br>", " <br>", "Yndol laughed again, an edge of mania to the sound. He had never been terribly balanced, following Leblanc less because he believed in her ideals than because she allowed him to indulge his unwholesome desires. He\u2019d been \u2013 he <i>was</i>, Lucas corrected himself \u2013 her attack dog. Content to follow at his mistress\u2019s heels when there was blood and plunder, but one to be watched. The commander had left Lucas to do just that while she oversaw the completion of their new base. Ever since the news had come in, Yndol had been harder to control. The dog wanted off the leash.<br>", " <br>", "Lucas had played for time, but he had few allies here. Most of the surviving Red Hands were old guard, pirates and marauders who\u2019d been impressed by \u2018<i>azea haal</i>\u2019s\u2019 coup. Like Yndol, they cared not one whit about the cause. Their loyalty was measured in the money they\u2019d earned under her, the opportunities for slaughter she\u2019d given them and \u2013 though they\u2019d never admit to it \u2013 the fear they\u2019d had of the Broken who\u2019d taken the Cursed Red Gauntlets and turned them into something greater. With Leblanc missing and presumed dead, there was too little of that to matter. Just as Yndol, they didn\u2019t see the need to bow their heads to a memory and certainly not the memory of a mere human. The man ground his teeth. Only a few weeks earlier, they would have never dared say that out loud.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cEveryone else who followed her is,\u201d the Tribune said. \u201cChattel butchered by the Compact. Led to that slaughter by our dear leader, the \u2018blue fire\u2019.\u201d Yndol chucked, the ugly sound coming from deep within his broad chest. \u201cNot burning so brightly now, is she?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Lucas ground his teeth. \u201cUntil we have confirmation of her death, you are still Red Hand.\u201d It was a poor argument, but it was all he had. He wasn\u2019t the orator that Leblanc had been \u2013 was.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cA name,\u201d Yndol grunted. \u201cWithout <i>azea haal</i>, it is merely words with no significance.\u201d He grinned wider. \u201cAnother name.\u201d The Tribune\u2019s black tongue slid over his gleaming teeth. \u201cThe fire has gone out, yes?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt will <i>never</i> go out,\u201d Lucas snapped, harsher than he\u2019d meant to.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt already has,\u201d the pirate said, reaching down to a put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cAnd I think, for the better. All that is left...\u201d his hand wrapped around Lucas\u2019s throat and he lifted the human into the air. \u201c...is extinguish the last embers.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The human scrabbled at Yndol\u2019s arms, but the Tribune was almost seven hundred pounds of pure muscle. Lucas\u2019s fingers bled as he cut himself on the alien\u2019s denticles \u2013 it was like clawing at a shark that had you in its mouth. Slowly, ever so slowly, Yndol tightened his grip. \u201cAnd we all know how to quench a fire,\u201d the Tribune explained helpfully as Lucas\u2019s vision dimmed. \u201cYou starve it of air.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Lucas gagged, struggling to breathe, but Yndol\u2019s grip was like iron. Somehow over the sound of blood rushing in his ears, he heard music. Harker drooled a laugh as he recognized the melody. He was dying. He had to be, because he was hearing... Yndol frowned, his ears twitching and he relaxed his chokehold a fraction, looking into the upper recesses of the amphitheater. Someone up there was a whistling, a tune he\u2019d heard before. \u201cWho is doing that?\u201d Yndol snarled. \u201cWhich of you whoresons thinks they are funny?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "A silhouette moved.\u201cPut him down.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Yndol smiled, looking back at his captive. \u201cA human,\u201d he drawled. \u201cAnother of your kind. You are like maggots; never seen but when you are, you writhe and squirm over each other in numbers. In our queen\u2019s fleet, it seemed that you could not take a step without a human\u2019s stench filling your nostrils. Alas, it still appears to be this way.\u201d He turned back to the speaker. \u201cWho are you to give a Tribune orders, Broken?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI am your queen,\u201d the now very-familiar voice said. Yndol blinked in astonishment as the speaker strode down the steps of the amphitheater, past each of the gawping Unbound. \u201cI am the human who killed Vuld and cut his heart out.\u201d A Broken female, with long blue hair hanging almost to her waist. She was clad in a stippled bodysuit, a cut-down blaster on her right thigh and a knife on her left. \u201cI am the \u2018blue fire\u2019. I <i>am</i> the Red Hand and I have returned.\u201d Many of those in the audience were looking away, some shrunk down in their chairs and a handful of others watched with obvious anticipation. \u201cAnd I just gave you an order,\u201d Leblanc said, her voice cold.<br>", " <br>", "Yndol glanced at Lucas as if remembering that the other human was still there. The Tribune opened his fist, letting the smaller man drop to the floor. Harker gasped for air, unable to rise to his feet. The Tribune laughed. It was low, it was rough and it was not quite sane. \u201cYou died,\u201d was all he said.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAnd yet, here I am.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou died,\u201d the Tribune repeated, soft and dangerous. \u201cEveryone who went with you burned. You died.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "She smiled. It was thin, like light glinting off a knife. \u201cThe fire rises, Yndol. Don\u2019t you know this?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "He took a step towards her. \u201cEveryone who went with you is dead. That means you\u2019re alone.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The human\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cBut I <i>am</i> here. Back on your leash, dog.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune laughed. The sound was ugly and raw. He laughed and then lunged, seven hundred pounds of muscle moving in a blur-<br>", " <br>", "-she met his charge, a flash of colour-<br>", " <br>", "-and time stopped. Or it seemed to. Yndol froze in his charge, his face twisted in astonishment. Leblanc had driven her hand into his chest. Bright red blood was already oozing out of the wound, pouring down her arm. The Tribune\u2019s expression was more confused than pained. \u201cWhat...\u201d he said, loosing a howl as Leblanc pulled her hand free, a gout of red splashing to the floor. The Tribune fell to his knees, putting a hand to his chest as he tried to stem the flow of blood. \u201cKill her...\u201d he rasped, his face contorted as shock gave way to agony. \u201cKill her!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Someone tried. Lucas never saw who. All he heard was the <i>crack</i> of a pistol and the accompanying flash of light in the dimly-lit room. He heard something like a sack of flour topple and roll down the steps of the amphitheater. Adrianna was still standing, her pistol held in her clean hand. She scanned it across the rows of pirates, the targeting laser drifting across forehead after forehead. \u201cOn. Your. Knees,\u201d the queen of the Red Hand snarled.<br>", " <br>", "These men and women, these murderers and rapists, smugglers and pirates, stared back at the tiny human. They were not the idealists who had burned with her \u2013 they were most mercenary of her band, the ones who hadn\u2019t yet been trusted to accompany her to Unicorn Set. They held no loyalty to any cause but themselves and they only followed the strongest. These dregs looked to the gasping form of Yndol, the headless body of their comrade and slight form of their queen, who had come among them alone... they were very conscious of their own weapons...<br>", " <br>", "...and they knelt.<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna made a noise much like a purr. She turned back to Yndol. \u201cYou see?\u201d she told him. \u201cThe fire rises.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune spat blood at her.<br>", " <br>", "She sighed. \u201cOh, Yndol. You could have been so much more. You could have been glorious. The Red Hand will be reborn. We have so much more to do. You could have been a part of it. My hound, my attack dog. You could have had your fill of blood and treasure, everything you\u2019d ever wanted. Why wouldn\u2019t you let me make you magnificent? Just once more?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "He cursed at her. \u201cYou are Broken,\u201d the Tribune gargled, blood seeping over his lips. \u201cYour race is pitiful and small and you... you are poisoned. You will kill us all.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cEveryone dies,\u201d Adrianna raised her pistol, pointing it at his temple. \u201cAll that matters is whether we\u2019re on our feet or our knees.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune opened his mouth for a final exhortation of defiance, but whatever he was going to say ended when Leblanc pulled the trigger, vapourizing the upper portion of his skull. Yndol\u2019s corpse thudded to the floor, the stench of burning Tribune meat filling the air.<br>", " <br>", "Leblanc held out a hand to Lucas, pulling him to his feet. She squeezed his shoulder, the only expression of compassion she would make in front of the rest of her followers. Adrianna turned back to the other pirates. \u201cI am aware,\u201d she drawled. \u201cThat there has been some question about leadership in past days. Let me say I welcome an open and transparent examination of our operations,\u201d her eyes hardened. \u201cI am just as eager as you to discuss with each of you the loss of so many of other brothers and sisters in arms at Unicorn Set.\u201d She strode out of the amphitheater, Harker following her. She paused at the top of the stairs. \u201cOh...\u201d she said, as if a passing thought had just struck her. \u201cSomeone clean up the mess.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Engineering was lost. The boat bays were in enemy hands and on every channel, all Idelogue Saban (and four names besides) could hear was dying. The invaders were insane, a boiling tide of filth that simply overran every position, heedless of the cost. He had never heard of Unbound who fought this way \u2013 they were carrion-eaters and scavengers, preying on the weak. <i>Unwavering Strike</i> was a heavy cruiser, fresh from the Odegon wombs and it had more firepower than entire Unbound clans. The vermin should have been cowering in their holes the instant this ship shocked in-system. Instead, they had the audacity \u2013 the gall \u2013 to attack a vessel of the Compact armada.<br>", " <br>", "What\u2019s more, they were winning. It was unthinkable. Impossible.<br>", " <br>", "Saban listened as someone screamed, the cry ending before it reached full pitch. He\u2019d ordered his remaining units to monitor only essential communications. They didn\u2019t need to hear this. Saban had lost communication with demagogue Tyrdon shortly after he\u2019d launched a counter-attack to retake engineering and Saban assumed his superior was dead.<br>", " <br>", "He cycled through the channels, listening for any hint of good news, but all he could hear was desperate last stands, calls for aid and that damnable chanting. It was like the pounding of a drum, clicking Broken words turned into a hateful cadence. One of the bridge officers studied dead languages; she\u2019d told Saban that it was a human dialect. It meant \u2018the fire rises\u2019.<br>", " <br>", "Saban knew what that meant. It was the war-cant of the Red Hand. They only chanted it when their leader took to the field. The bitch herself, the so-called <i>azea haal</i> was on his ship. The Janissary ground his teeth in righteous hatred. The Cursed Red Gauntlets had once been one of a thousand equally pathetic raider clans, clinging to life like parasites on the body of the Compact. Until her, until some wretched <i>Broken</i> had changed them into the Red Hand.<br>", " <br>", "The Janissary tapped his forefinger against his carbine\u2019s trigger guard. He wanted to move, to stalk, to hunt and kill the vermin that were infesting <i>Unwavering Strike</i>, but his duty was to protect the command deck... as long as the bridge held, there was still a chance that the ship could be re-taken. Saban frowned suddenly, switching channels. One of the forward defence posts had gone dark. The datafeeds from that section were down, so the ideologue used his command override to patch into ideologue, submissive Vansk\u2019s helmet display. Her scopes were offline, but her helmet cam was still running, staring at the submissive\u2019s own beheaded form. Her legs were still twitching, spastic impulses from a failing nervous system.<br>", " <br>", "Silhouettes, grotesque and stunted parodies of a Tribune\u2019s form, filtered past as Vansk\u2019s killers picked their way through the gore of the murdered Janissary squad. They made no sound as they did so, but all Saban would have to do was switch to an open frequency to hear that damnable chanting.<br>", " <br>", "They were coming.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cContact,\u201d the squad\u2019s scope specialist announced. Telemetry from her vambrace augur appeared on Saban\u2019s HUD. Three point sources were moving towards Saban and his last line of defence. A probe or suicide attack. The ideologue gestured and his soldiers took up firing positions, moving into what little cover the corridor provided. They\u2019d erected barricades and a single crew-served weapon. Enough firepower to stall even the most dedicated berserker charge.<br>", " <br>", "One of the contacts halted in its advance, disappearing from the motion tracker. Saban\u2019s eyes narrowed. A casualty... those weren\u2019t hostile raiders \u2013 they were fleeing allies! \u201cReady weapons,\u201d he said, bracing himself into a firing position, raising his carbine. \u201cFire on my order only. We may be seeing friendlies.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "A second contact faded from scopes. Only one left and it was moving , desperation lending it speed. Saban watched as a security officer ran into view, skidding around the corner. His armour was cracked and burnt, charred lacerations cut into his cuirass. He fell to his knees, scrambling to his feet. He looked up, his face drawn in terror behind his cracked faceplate. \u201cHelp me!\u201d The man shouted. \u201cHelp-\u201d He turned, something catching his eye. \u201cNo! No, get back!\u201d he screamed, drawing his sidearm and firing wildly at a target Saban couldn\u2019t see. A form leapt into view, small and lithe. Something crackled in its hands, a sapphire blur. The proctor shrieked, the cry ending mid-pitch as he was impaled on the deck. The figure wrenched the blade free, looking towards Saban. It was small, like a malnourished child, clad in a thin bodysuit and only lightly armoured. Red lenses were set into its faceless helm, giving it an insectile appearance. In one hand, it carried a brutal-looking khopesh, the dark blade crackling and sparking with a disruption field. In its other hand it carried an unidentifiable pistol.<br>", " <br>", "None of that concerned him as much as the mane of blue hair that had spilled out of the back its helm, the ends burnt short. It was her. It was <i>her</i>. It was the human, the Red Hands\u2019 bitch-queen. The glance Saban and Leblanc shared hadn\u2019t lasted even a second before the Tribune roared. \u201cOpen fire!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "She moved \u2013 Triarchs, she was <i>fast</i>, faster than Saban believed possible \u2013 dancing and writhing through the fusillade she avoided the worst of it, but the corridor wasn\u2019t wide enough to dodge every single shot. Still, she almost reached them. Rounds struck her in the chest, arms, legs and face and Saban saw her fall. \u201cCease!\u201d he shouted. He wanted there to be enough left of her to identify. He had served under demagogue Rynzlr \u2013 if there was enough left of the Broken, he was going to honour man\u2019s memory with the sow\u2019s head or perhaps just her scalp. He looked over at convert Jadu. \u201cConfirm the kill.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Jadu nodded. He strode forward, his rifle held in his hands, watching the Broken. There was a hazy shimmer around her body and the Tribune blinked. That looked like a-<br>", " <br>", "She was on her feet an instant later, spinning inside Jadu\u2019s guard, her balesword shrieking as it cut through his armour. \u201cNot that easy,\u201d she hissed to the Janissary as he died on her blade. She swung her pistol under his limp arm and fired. Another soldier died and the squad opened up again, their barrage hitting their own man. She vaulted over the shuddering corpse and launched herself down the hallway, landing amidst them. The first stroke of her sword cut the barrel from the heavy assault cannon. Her next shot ended a third soldier\u2019s life. She spun through the Tribune ranks, licking out with blade and pistol, always moving, avoiding the worst of their attacks. Combat drugs shrilled in her veins, inuring her to her own pain as she shot and slashed her way through the horde of soldiers.<br>", " <br>", "Cut. An arm ended at the elbow. Cut. A leg was opened to the bone. Cut. A throat was slashed. Cut. Cut. Cut.<br>", " <br>", "The dance ended, her partners lying at her feet.<br>", " <br>", "Her squad arrived moments later, several of them freezing for an instant as they beheld their queen. She stood amongst the dead, panting. Several ribs were broken. Her was suit torn, blood and inorganic fluids leaked from her wounds. The broken tip of a Janissary\u2019s gladius was lodged in her side, patches of her skin were burnt from the close-range discharge of energy weapons, liquefied meat and pus oozing over her bodysuit. Self-repair mechanisms were already at work, the machine in her repairing itself, regenerating her grievous words. Coated in gore, flush with adrenalin and the euphoria of the combat drugs, she was grinning.<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna pulled her torn faceplate off, raising a shaking arm and pointing to the door to the heavy cruiser\u2019s command deck. \u201cOpen it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Her soldiers hurried to obey, very few daring to look their blood-drenched queen in the eyes.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou outpaced us,\u201d Lucas admonished. He kept his eyes averted from the exposed cybernetic parts of her body, like a bashful suitor catching his dearest naked. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI know,\u201d Leblanc admitted. He was right; she was more than she\u2019d ever been, but she was still only one woman. Her new abilities could only protect her so much. Her personal shield had been overtaxed; it had nearly failed and if it did, it was effectively useless for the rest of the battle. Status markers and warning icons were blinking in her field of vision; she banished them with a single mental command. She\u2019d made a calculated risk in leading this charge. She was still rebuilding the Red Hand \u2013 she needed a victory to inspire the people she had left and draw new ones to her banner. Not a simple raid or plundering of a helpless colony. Something like the capture of a Compact heavy cruiser. The Unbound only respected strength and so she would be strong. She\u2019d be more than the Red Queen \u2013 she\u2019d be \u2018<i>azea haal</i>\u2019, that name she hated.<br>", " <br>", "<i>The shuttle settled itself in </i>Nemesis<i>\u2019s primary hangar, a perfect landing. As the armoured doors of the bay closed, Adrianna could just barely see the form of the freighter </i>Hope\u2019s Well<i>. It wasn\u2019t the most extravagant ride she\u2019d ever had, but it would do. As the doors closed and the atmosphere flooded back into the bay, the young woman picked up her duffel bag and trotted towards the waiting shuttle. It was a boxy, utilitarian affair, one of countless millions across the galaxy. There was no pilot. For that matter, there was no crew aboard the freighter waiting for her. Not anymore.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI have pre-programmed a single warp into the freighter\u2019s mainframe,\u201d Red One reminded Leblanc. \u201cIt will take you to Namadine Prek.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The young woman nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll see what my loyal submissives have been getting up to.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI think I might have to kill at least one of them.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The ship did not have a reply for that. \u201cBe careful,\u201d she said instead. \u201cMy modifications have improved your abilities substantially, but they do not make you immortal.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI know,\u201d Adrianna replied. She\u2019d been given much, but there was a price. In addition to all her improvements, Red One had installed a security measure \u2013 a self-destruct charge that would remove any trace of Leblanc\u2019s implants. If she were ever killed or captured, the Compact would never know the true nature of her upgrades. Adrianna could set it off at will, if she chose. \u201cI\u2019ll be careful. Well,\u201d she amended. \u201cMore careful.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cPlease do,\u201d Red One hesitated a moment. \u201cI know you want to focus your efforts on Rally,\u201d she said. This wasn\u2019t the first time she and Adrianna had had this argument. Leblanc had, at last, come around to the ship\u2019s rationale. Though the Compact was extremely watchful of the humans, it treated them with a <i>slightly</i> lighter touch than it did many other client races. It did this because less out of magnanimity than out of concern that harsh treatment might spur <i>Nemesis</i> to correspondingly harsh actions. If, however, Adrianna focussed her attentions on Rally, the Compact would respond \u2013 and likely not in moderation. Though the truth of humanity\u2019s history was lost, even to many in the Compact itself, enough of them remembered the Confederacy\u2019s \u2018crimes\u2019. They would never let such things happen again. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna\u2019s head came up and her eyes flashed. It had been a frequent argument, but it was the one she resented losing the most. \u201cI know,\u201d she said, more harshly than she liked. \u201cI know,\u201d she repeated, moderating her tone. Her gaze dropped to the deck. \u201cI know. I... don\u2019t want to,\u201d she admitted. \u201cWhen I was little, I used to look around at all the other boys and girls in my neighbourhood, how happy they were. I wasn\u2019t. I kept asking myself what was wrong with me. I saw the same question in my parent\u2019s eyes after every altercation. I saw it in the confessors\u2019 and counsellors\u2019 eyes when I was lectured on how to behave. I heard exasperated teachers ask it of me. It was even the last thing Commissioner Sath said when I killed him. \u2018What is wrong with you?\u2019. Every day of my life I\u2019ve had that question in my head. Why couldn\u2019t I fit in. Why couldn\u2019t I be like everyone else?\u201d Wetness pooled in the corners of her eyes. \u201cI pushed it all away, so far down that I wouldn\u2019t have to think about it. But it\u2019s not me, is it? It\u2019s them. It\u2019s been a thousand years of social engineering, propaganda and eugenics that did this to them.\u201d She looked up, a tear curling down her cheeks. Her expression, for once, lacked the shields of manufactured sadism, mercurial bravado and every other aspect she donned in her \u2018Red Queen\u2019 persona.\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave them.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou have to,\u201d Red One told her. \u201cThe Compact will never stop hunting you. If you try to hold onto Rally, the Compact will only tighten their grip on the world. It will give them every excuse they need to justify their excesses. I won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna nodded, picking her duffel bag back up. She trudged towards the waiting shuttle, then paused just before the ramp. \u201cDo we have a chance?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo we have a chance at all?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the ancient machine said after a moment. \u201cMore of one before we met. It\u2019s still not much. I haven\u2019t hoped for a very long time. All I know is vengeance.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The pirate nodded, her mask of theatrical brutality back in place. \u201cThe killing will never stop.\u201d She climbed into the shuttle, Red One taking it back to the </i>Hope\u2019s Well<i>. The woman who played at being a queen looked out the window at the dwindling shape of UECNS </i>Nemesis<i>. It was the last time she ever saw the ship.</i><br>", " <br>", "Adrianna looked at her people. They were scared of her, in awe of her. <i>That</i> was what she needed. To prove to the old guard and the new that she was their queen, their ruler and they could follow her or be destroyed. None of them, not even Lucas, knew the truth about her resurrection. Those she trusted at all were told of a secret pact she\u2019d made with a cabal of outlawed scientists, that they had recovered her barely-breathing form and fulfilled their end of a devil\u2019s bargain. The others? Let them wonder.<br>", " <br>", "They said she had always been this way \u2013 that was how she had bested Vuld. That she was a clone and the original had died back in the ambush, that if she fell another would simply take her place. That she had been infected by some ancient artefact and it had repaired her. That that same artefact was consuming her flesh bit by bit. That she had been a Compact cyborg experiment that had gone rogue. The theories and rumours piled higher every day and she encouraged them all.<br>", " <br>", "Yes, her people... they would follow her to the gates of Hell and back out of loyalty, avarice or outright fear, but fear of her \u2018benefactor\u2019 would eclipse that. So she let them believe as they wanted. All that really mattered was that she was the woman that the Compact couldn\u2019t kill; that she had defied them and lived. They tried to execute her; she escaped. They\u2019d try to burn her; she came back.<br>", " <br>", "<i>I wonder what they\u2019ll do for the third time?</i><br>", " <br>", "Adrianna\u2019s demolitions expert gestured, catching her attention. \u201cReady.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The pirate queen drew her pistol, checking its charge. She pulled her damaged helm back into place, smiling beneath it as she donned her bloody persona once again. \u201cThis is our ship now,\u201d she told them. \u201cLet\u2019s finish the cleanup.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Enmet\u2019ej, lord of the Memetic Virus, laced his long fingers in his lap as he considered the image gleaming above his desk. \u201cForty thousand,\u201d he said. \u201cNo more.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cEighty,\u201d the small scrap of nothing piped in its annoyingly high-pitched voice. \u201cNo less.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cUnacceptable,\u201d Enmet\u2019ej said testily. \u201cI would have no profit left.

I would say <i>human</i> hubris, but your species has little to be proud of.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna smiled. \u201cShould I be insulted at the dismissal of my race or flattered that my capture of <i>Unwavering Strike</i> is considered something worthy of pride?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAs you like,\u201d Enmet\u2019ej answered. \u201cLesser species, I find, will put their own interpretations on obvious facts regardless of how simply they are presented.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou are trying to make me angry,\u201d the human countered. \u201cI think you\u2019re trying to get this member of a primitive species so worked up she forgets how to negotiate properly. Hasn\u2019t that ever bitten you on the ass?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Thoughtful\u2019s eyelids blinked asynchronously as he processed the idiom. \u201cIf I take your meaning properly... no. More emotional individuals have reacted with haste \u2013 often cancelling negotiations, only to find that I am the only one able to deal with their products. Then they must return to me and accept weaker terms than before. Those who respond with hostility often do not complete their negotiations at all.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAnd then you use their lack of tact and their decision to threaten you to extort better terms from their crew,\u201d the Broken clicked her tongue. \u201cRisky and situational. Eighty.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cFifty. My operating costs have gone up as yours have.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSeventy-five. Your costs aren\u2019t my problem.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThey are when you create them. Your actions have brought the Compact\u2019s wrath down across this entire expanse. Networks have been torn up, operators have been killed or imprisoned \u2013 the remaining assets have raised their fees accordingly. Non-cartel contacts have gone silent or substantially increased asking prices for their services. You would know this if you cared to lower yourself to such acts as smuggling as the Cursed Red Gauntlets once did. Fifty-five.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe still smuggle.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Enmet\u2019ej sniffed disdainfully. \u201cYou smuggle weapons to pathetic insurrectionist groups.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI believe you\u2019re trying to goad me again. The Red Hand-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201c-is <i>truly</i> Unbound,\u201d the Thoughtful sneered. \u201cThe cartels, we have our little ventures. Our games. We all have our little territories. We smuggle, we dodge tariffs and shipping fees, we take ships and ransom them back, we deal in narcotics, some flesh trafficking. The Compact seeks to stop us and so it goes back and forth in our little game. No one wins, but the wheel keeps turning. We keep making money. More some years, less in others.\u201d The pirate lord leaned forward. \u201cThe Red Hand is an uncertain investment, <i>azea haal</i>.You make the other cartels nervous.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cGood,\u201d Adrianna flashed her teeth.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOnly a primitive such as yourself would see it that way,\u201d Enmet\u2019ej replied. \u201cWe wage our own wars between ourselves over territory, resources \u2013 the usual reasons. These are civilized affairs and when one cartel destroys another, there are rules. Decorum. Protocol.\u201d He tapped the tabletop. \u201cYou broke all of these. The Waiting Noose and the Everlasting Gloaming-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201c-were in my way,\u201d the human interrupted. \u201cSo I got rid of them.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou murdered their lords and leaders.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d she smiled.

She was almost nine feet tall and all of it was muscle. Her tufted ears twitched as she leaned forward, showing far too much d\u00e9colletage for Adrianna\u2019s liking. Tribune anatomy was only just similar enough to human for rough comparisons to be drawn in form and function, but there were still... differences. \u201cYou speak above your station, little spark,\u201d she said wetly, running her tongue over her teeth. Her blind daylight eyes were covered by a silk cloth and her smaller nocturnal eyes focused angrily on her host. \u201cWe came to this meeting out of respect for the blood your small hand has shed, but we will not be spoken to in such a manner by a human.\u201d Her coterie of underlings rumbled agreement.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cVuld liked my insolence,\u201d Adrianna replied. \u201cHe found it... interesting.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cVuld was a fool,\u201d Kasht snapped. \u201cHe allowed himself to be killed by a Broken. Clearly, he was not the fighter nor even the man I thought he was.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI believe we\u2019re getting off topic,\u201d Kebraas Toun, the \u2018Weighted Arbiter\u2019 of the Waiting Noose said. The Judiciary raised a finger on one of his small secondary arms. \u201cWe are here to discuss the Red Hand\u2019s encroachment into our traditional hunting grounds, not retread our personal dislikes.\u201d His cracked-gemstone eyes tightened a little as he focused his attention on Adrianna. \u201cHowsoever much it may be warranted.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201c\u2018Shut up and focus on the matter at hand\u2019,\u201d Kasht lowered the pitch of her voice, mocking her fellow Unbound leader. \u201cThat\u2019s all that need be said, Toun. Never one word when three will do, eh?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou were not given permission to use my familiar name, Night Queen,\u201d the Judiciary replied stiffly. \u201cI afford you the courtesy of your station and I expect the same respect be given to my person.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI summoned you here in the hopes of avoiding bloodshed,\u201d Adrianna interjected before Kasht could snarl whatever response came to the Tribune\u2019s mind. \u201cThe Magnameric Canyon has over five hundred star systems; nearly a fifth are inhabited and most of those are worlds are under the purview of the Commission for the Stabilization of Territories and the corporations. To lay all our cards on the table... I want the Canyon to run red with blood. I want CST enforcers and overseers to swing from the lampposts on each of those hundred worlds. I want fires to run through the gated communities, the privileged to have to bar their doors at night in fear of those \u2018lesser races\u2019 they\u2019ve used as serfs for the last thousand years. I want to hear cries of defiance rip from every helot\u2019s throat. That\u2019s what I want. What </i>you<i> want is to run your own small-time games. You want to run drugs, peddle flesh and sack the occasional starship.\u201d She smiled toothily. \u201cI\u2019ll even let you. But you will let the Red Hand into the Canyon, you will stop interfering with our operations and you will stay out of our way.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou\u2019re insane,\u201d snapped Kasht. \u201cYou want to start a rebellion?\u201d She barked with laughter. \u201cI\u2019d heard that the Broken queen of the Red Hand was bent, but I had no idea how much until now.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThe profitability of your course of action does seem... difficult to assess,\u201d Kebraas put in diplomatically. \u201cI find it difficult to accept that a cartel would forsake all material reward.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI never said we had,\u201d Adrianna replied. \u201cMy profit margins are not your concern.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cEnough of this!\u201d Kasht snapped, slamming her fists on the table. \u201cI\u2019ve heard enough. This diseased little sow-\u201d she pointed a finger at Adrianna. \u201c-wants to feed us straight to the Black with her plan. You want to turn the Canyon \u2013 </i>my<i> hunting grounds \u2013 into a meat grinder. The Compact will come in and slaughter you. Whatever small gains you make will be lost. I would gladly watch it all come crashing down around you but except for the small problem of my cartel getting caught in the crossfire!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI must agree with my associate of the Everlasting Gloaming,\u201d Kebraas pointed out. \u201cYour plan will, at best, lead to widespread reprisals against the grey markets and all cartels within the Canyon. At worst, you will destabilize the entire region. That is bad for business.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSo your answer is no?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou intend to start a war,\u201d the Judiciary pointed out. \u201cI cannot allow that to happen. Your Red Hand is not welcome in the Magnameric Canyon, nor will they ever be. I will grant the forces you have in the region some time to evacuate before I purge them from our holdings.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI\u2019ll do one better,\u201d Kasht replied. \u201cI\u2019ll send each of your people back to you, little spark. It will be up to you to put them back together.\u201d She leaned across the table, her lips curling back from her teeth, the tip of her snout centimeters from Adrianna\u2019s face. \u201cAnd I\u2019m putting a bounty on every one of your whore-born lunatics.\u201d Her voice softened. \u201cIf we catch </i>you<i>...

Adrianna put her elbows on the tabletop, lacing her fingers together and rested her chin on the backs of her hands, a signal she had arranged before the meeting. \u201cMaybe you can do better. Then again...\u201d she smiled. \u201cMaybe you can\u2019t.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "One of Kebraas Toun\u2019s men noticed it first. By agreement, no one had brought any technology into the meeting, but one of the Noosemen had secreted a small augur on his person and it began to ping urgently. \u201cArbiter Kebraas!\u201d the pirate shouted. \u201cThe air...!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI did try,\u201d Adrianna said, a tinge of sadness in her voice. \u201cI would have made you glorious. I would have made the Everlasting Gloaming and Waiting Nooses names to be remembered with awe. Now, it will only be as fools.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Judiciary snatched the device from his underling, his eyes widening as he read the information on it. \u201cYou\u2019re insane!\u201d he waved the augur at Adrianna accusingly. \u201cYou\u2019ll die too!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "She shrugged. \u201cMaybe.\u201d  Several of the Unbound were already clutching at their throats. \u201cMaybe I just need to live a little longer than you.

You are unpredictable. You fight when you should run. The Compact hates you in a way that they have shown towards very few Unbound. The mere mention of your name and a sector swarms with CSS agents. A sighting of your ships and the starlanes are clogged with the Space Force.

The Thoughtful took it as an indication to proceed. \u201cYou surprise me. I have heard many stories of... the \u2018blue fire\u2019. Most, I am sure, are exaggerated \u2013 I have no doubt there are tales of my own accomplishments that far exceed the scope and grandeur of anything I have actually accomplished. However, these stories often describe a, shall we say, less diplomatic Red Queen. I expected something akin to the old tales of humans.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cMy dear viral lord,\u201d Adrianna said \u201cYou of all people should take no stock in the stories of old.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cPerhaps, but until the first story of the shame of Rally reached my ears, I was of the opinion that humans were merely creatures with Erili\u2019s described \u2018functional mind\u2019.

Many say that we are all that there is in this world. They say there are no gods or goddesses. That prayers go unanswered. They are wrong. The hall is rented, but the orchestra has yet to arrive. The dance won\u2019t begin until the music starts.\u201d Adrianna\u2019s grin widened and the smaller female bowed theatrically, her sparkling blue hair spilling down her shoulders. \u201cThank you for your consideration.\u201d</div>"]}

As it always must have.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna Leblanc glared balefully at Rynzlr with her remaining eye. She tried to spit at him, but all she accomplished was spattering her own face with bloody mucus. She couldn\u2019t move; her back was broken. Her legs too. She was certain that she was bleeding internally. She had been caught between sections when the base had come under attack. The ceiling had cracked above her head and then she had woken up here, unable to move. She didn\u2019t know how the Compact had found them; the only warning had been when the extermination force had opened fire on the planet.<br>", " <br>", "The comm piece in her ear was still working. A few of her ships had gotten off the ground; those that had made it into space had pleaded for clemency. She\u2019d heard their crews scream. She hadn\u2019t seen the fiery contrails of their remains falling back through the atmosphere, but she had felt the impacts as each of them slammed into the ground. They should have known better.... maybe they did. They\u2019d died relatively quickly.<br>", " <br>", "She\u2019d hoped to at least bleed out before the Compact kill teams found her, unfortunately even that had been beyond the gods\u2019 mercy today. Now, Rynzlr was crouched over her, watching her die. His men stood around him, watching the scene with dark amusement.<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune pulled off one gauntlet and deftly opened one of the pouches on his belt, drawing out one of the kerchiefs he always carried with him. He leaned in close and mopped up the blood around her mouth. \u201cThere now,\u201d the Tribune said. \u201cThat\u2019s better, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "She gargled a curse at him and he laughed. \u201cI told you,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cI told you that I would be there on the day that you died. That I would hunt you down like the vermin you are, burn you out of whatever hole you had gone to ground in and that my face would be the last thing that you ever saw. I recall also saying that I would take great pleasure in watching you die.\u201d He laughed again. \u201cSo far, I have not been proven a liar.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cFuck... you...\u201d Adrianna hissed through her teeth, coughing up a lungful of blood.<br>", " <br>", "Rynzlr\u2019s expression turned dark. \u201cDo you even know how many people you have killed, Broken? How many good soldiers have died because of you?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Even smiling was painful, but Adrianna managed to lift her head a little, grinning a crimson rictus at her old enemy. \u201cNot... enough.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Like a doctor pushing a weary patient back onto her bed, the demagogue pushed Adrianna\u2019s head back down with a single finger. \u201cYou die in the dirt,\u201d he informed her. \u201cJust like how you were born. How <i>all</i> of you were born. Animals rutting in the muck \u2013 that is all humanity is. Broken.\u201d He laughed again, as if he were the first to make that joke. \u201cYou will always be at our feet.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d Adrianna whispered. It was getting harder to breathe and she was fighting for each short, increasingly shallow breath. \u201cWe won\u2019t. If it\u2019s not me, then someone else. Someone else... will start the fire.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThere won\u2019t be any fire. You were a little spark. An annoying ember that burned our hands once or twice, but there was no great conflagration. That was all you were, a lone, little spark amongst a sodden pile of wood, blazing brightly as you fell, but sure to be snuffed out.\u201d There was a rasp of metal as the Tribune drew his gladius and Adrianna\u2019s eyes widened.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNow, correct me if I\u2019m wrong,\u201d Rynzlr said as he leaned over Adrianna, putting one hand over her mouth. \u201cBut I <i>did</i> say I\u2019d take your head and mount it in my office, didn\u2019t I? Yes, I think I did.\u201d He leaned further over her, his breath soft on her skin as he whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s how you\u2019re going to be remembered, little ember. As a failure. You started no fire, inspired no rebellions. You died in the dark, forgotten and abandoned by your people...betrayed by them. A failure,\u201d he repeated, a sadistic glint in all four of his eyes as he pressed the blade against Adrianna\u2019s throat. \u201cAnd a paperweight.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "<i>Adrianna wrenched her blade out of the dead Janissary\u2019s throat, panting from exertion. Her armour was battered and cracked, her weapons were all but drained and even her knife was chipped and blunted. Every muscle in her body ached, but her forces had won through \u2013 the last of the Compact forces in this area were down. \u201cTalk to me, Lucas,\u201d she snapped into her comm.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cWe have the package,\u201d her second reported. \u201cTaking fire, but we have begun extraction. Light forces only; you were right \u2013 they went straight for your diversion.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Adrianna laughed. \u201cOf course they did.\u201d She looked around, at the ruins of Esseldon\u2019s marina, blue-water yachts and skimmers burning, shots and screams still drifting across the bay as her forces overran the few scattered remaining pockets of resistance, or simply indulged their violent passions. This was where Esseldon\u2019s rich and powerful had come to play, spending the money the planet\u2019s working class earned for them. Each of these ships cost more than miners earned in a lifetime and they were well stocked with expensive wines, rare </i>objets d\u2019art<i> and valuable prisoners. No more so than today, the opening of a regatta where each oligarch strove to outdo the others in wasteful extravagance. Today they\u2019d paid for all the blood on their hands with their own. And that was but the diversion, the appetizer she committed her most bloodthirsty troops to, while Lucas and her elites went about a different mission entirely.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>The woman grinned savagely as she beheld the fuel-slick, blood-choked waters, littered with the wreckage of ships and skimmers. Police cars burned as brightly as luxury vehicles, sinking military transports holed by the fusillade that had brought them down, caught off-guard by the pirates\u2019 firepower.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>She turned on her heel, stalking back to her gunship, </i>Spite<i>. In the distance, she\u2019d seen the specks of incoming attack craft. They\u2019d be on her position in minutes, pincering her against the armoured columns that were grinding through the city\u2019s panic-clogged streets. \u201cWe are leaving,\u201d she announced to her forces. \u201cUnless I miss my guess, my dear friend Rynzler is coming to say hello. Grab whatever you can carry, holster your guns, put your dicks back in your pants and get to the shuttles. If you fall behind, you can play with the demagogue.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "Spite<i> lifted into the air in the instant her boots hit the deck, boosting into the atmosphere, several other landers already following her example. Already, ineffectual fire was beginning to track towards her pinnace, but the gunship was moving too fast for a visual solution and its countermeasures were keeping the Compact scopes from locking on.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>The pirate queen stalked into the cockpit. \u201cFind me the Janissary command frequency,\u201d she ordered, one of the crew handing her a headset as another played with </i>Spite<i>\u2019s command functions. She turned back to the personnel compartment, looking out the window. He wouldn\u2019t be with the airborne forces. Rynzlr loved to go in dirty. She focused on the armoured column instead. There; she spotted a command-variant Grinder, flanked by a pair of Blackened Feather anti-air tanks. Their gun barrels flashed as they fired ineffectively at </i>Spite<i>, hyper-velocity rounds ripping through the air around the gunship, but unable to hit the elusive craft.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cWe have the frequency,\u201d the ops officer reported.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Adrianna grinned. \u201cCut me in.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201c-that bitch!\u201d Rynzlr raged at his teams. \u201cOne of you target that Broken whore\u2019s craft and blow her out of the sky! I don\u2019t want excuses, I want her head!\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cHello, Rynzlr,\u201d Adrianna purred sveltely. \u201cLate to the party as always.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>There was a moment of silence before the demagogue could even speak. \u201cI swear by the blood of the Triarchs and my very soul, I will kill you for what you\u2019ve done here.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Adrianna smile widened. \u201cIf you say so. The last we tangled, you gave me this beautiful new gunship. I even named it in honour of you.\u201d She was baiting him, playing to those listening in. \u201cAre you sure you won\u2019t come off any worse the next time we dance?\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cYou will die,\u201d Rynzlr said, very quietly, his voice quavering as he struggled to remain calm. \u201cI swear it. I will find you. I will hunt you to the ends of the universe, until the end of time itself. I will find you and I will cleave your skull from your head. It will sit on my desk as a warning to every other Unbound and Broken for this and the next hundred generations.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>She laughed then. \u201c</i>Nemesis<i> rises,\u201d she mocked. The blasphemous insult was the final straw for the demagogue and he screamed and cursed his rage at her, long after she\u2019d closed the channel and her ship vanished into the heavens.</i><br>", " <br>", "Adrianna tried to struggle, to spit one last curse but the strength had ebbed out of her body and all she could do was stare at her enemy. Frothy blood bubbled up from her lips and Rynzlr laughed at her impotence, enjoying the fearful knowledge in her eyes. He was about to slit the Unbound\u2019s throat when he lifted his head, his attention drawn by a staccato hiss whispering through the air.<br>", " <br>", "His Janissaries heard it too and they raised their weapons. It was probably just the bunker\u2019s damaged air circulation system...<br>", " <br>", "Wait...<br>", " <br>", "Rynzlr\u2019s eyes narrowed as he saw a ghostly shimmer in the hall, the swish of stirred motes of dust. There was something there \u2013 he opened his mouth to shout a warning, but all that came out was a scream as that same something ripped through his chestplate, lifting him off the ground.<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna watched as the Tribune howled in agony, nearly half a ton of muscle and armour kicking uselessly against the air. Red-slick talons had torn through straight through his armour, hissing and sparking as the energy fields arcing over them cooked the Tribune\u2019s blood. More vital fluids gushed from the wound, spraying over his assailant. It was as tall as a Tribune in power armour, encased in a suit of its own. Adrianna watched as it pulled Rynzlr closer, the Tribune\u2019s legs flailing uselessly, his arms braced against his attacker as he tried to prevent himself from being further impaled. He failed, his hand slipping off its helmet and he sagged forward, face to face with his killer. \u201cI <i>hate</i> you,\u201d it whispered into his gaping, shocked visage before a powerful flick of its arm hurled the demagogue away to crash against the bulkhead.<br>", " <br>", "Fire tore at it; solid shot, slugs, flechettes and energy beams as the Janissary squad opened fire, but the killer was already moving, too fast to see, dancing through the barrage. It was among the Tribunes in an instant, its gleaming claws moving in blinding arcs that slashed through armour and flesh. Adrianna could only track it by the sounds of cutting. In seconds, there was only the hiss and pop of burning blood.<br>", " <br>", "She sagged her head against the floor; from here, she could see Rynzlr. The demagogue\u2019s eyes were wide and staring and he was gasping for breath as his life ebbed out of him. A shadow fell over Adrianna and she looked up into the dripping crimson visage of a killer. \u201cI heard you call,\u201d it said. In the distance, she could hear screams and the dull thuds and shrills of weapons fire. \u201cAnd I came.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "There was movement around her; others, coming to her aid. Hands dug into the rubble, digging the dying woman out. Adrianna took one last look at Rynzlr, the demagogue staring at her with all the hatred he could muster, still trying to climb to his feet. Somehow, before it all went black, she found the strength to laugh.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "She woke up. There was blackness all around her and for an instant, panic seized her. She couldn\u2019t even move.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou\u2019re safe,\u201d a young woman\u2019s voice said from nowhere. She didn\u2019t recognize the speaker, but it wasn\u2019t a Tribune. In fact... it sounded human. \u201cI\u2019ve shut down your motor responses to prevent you from moving and inadvertently hurting yourself.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna swallowed. \u201cI can\u2019t see.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou have a subdermal hematoma at the back of your skull,\u201d the unseen woman replied gently. \u201cThe blood pooled there while you were on the ground and it\u2019s putting pressure on your visual cortex.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI can\u2019t feel my...\u201d Adrianna realized that she couldn\u2019t feel <i>anything</i>. \u201cAnything,\u201d she whispered.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI\u2019ve administered a large dose of painkillers. The anesthetic is responsible for the numbing sensation. In actuality, you are in quite a lot of pain.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWho are you? Where am I?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou\u2019re safe,\u201d the girl assured her. \u201cThe Compact fleet attacking your outpost was destroyed. I recovered you from the rubble.\u201d A beat. \u201cThere were no other survivors. The Janissaries were under orders to terminate all personnel.\u201d Another pause. \u201cI am sorry.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my questions,\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cWho are you? Where am I?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "There was a longer pause. \u201cThe answer to those questions are one and the same,\u201d the voice said at last. \u201cI am the United Earth Confederacy Naval Ship <i>Nemesis</i> and you are currently aboard my primary medical bay. You called me,\u201d the ship said. \u201cAnd I answered.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna laughed, the manic sound fuelled by disbelief at the claim and the terror of her helplessness. \u201cYou... no, you\u2019re not real,\u201d she asserted. \u201cThe <i>Nemesis</i> was destroyed two thousand years ago by <i>Bringer of Light</i>. I saw the records. You\u2019re lying. You\u2019re <i>lying</i>.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt was actually the other way around,\u201d the girl said, her voice hardening. \u201cBut we can argue the facts of my existence later. I brought you out of this medically-induced coma for a reason. You are dying. The damage to your body is extreme. Multiple organ failures, severe internal bleeding, extensive nerve damage. I have four options, but I need your consent before beginning any medical procedures.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Her lips felt dry. She wanted to lick them, but her body was so numb that she didn\u2019t know if she could. \u201cWhat-\u201c she fought back the quaver in her voice. \u201cWhat options?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThe first is simple: you reject my assistance. You will die within the hour. I will continue to administer an anesthetic drip to prevent you from feeling pain. If requested, I can also euthanize you.\u201d The matter of fact way the speaker \u2013 Adrianna wasn\u2019t yet prepared to admit that she was talking to an artificial intelligence \u2013 said it made her skin crawl, but the young woman continued. \u201cYour second option is that I stabilize you, but do nothing else. You will permanently lose the use of your legs and will require several organ transplants.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSure. You\u2019ve got a bunch of surgeons in the next room.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo. I have a surgical suite that has more anatomical knowledge and greater skill than any organic doctor.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "If her lips had felt dry previously, this mad her mouth a desert. The thought of a machine \u2013 or a lunatic who thought she was a machine \u2013 cutting her open... it was... no, this was impossible. All of this was impossible. It had to be. But there it was: the smallest, tiniest bit of hope that compelled her to silence her tirade of denials and ask, in a very small voice: \u201cWhat else?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOption three: Life-saving treatment, coupled with improved regenerative protocols. This will restore you to near-full functionality, but it will require physical therapy and considerable recuperation. Your physiology is likely to reject most regeneration treatments, so this will be very time-consuming.\u201d There was another pause. \u201cYou have a fourth option.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSo you\u2019ve said. What is it?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The voice told her.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThirty kilometers per hour,\u201d Red One announced.<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna smiled a little at that. She\u2019d always kept herself in good shape, but even on her best day, she\u2019d never been able to run this fast, or for this long. Her legs were almost a blur as she ran on the treadmill, watching the odometer tick upwards at a literally inhuman rate. She was sweating, her clothes stained through and through and her heart was pounding, but less than some of her previous workouts. Her smile widened. She was running faster than any human ever had \u2013 faster than some vehicles and she was only a little winded.<br>", " <br>", "This had been Red One\u2019s fourth option: to rebuild her. She wasn\u2019t a machine \u2013 she was still very much flesh and blood. There was just less of it. Her bones had been reinforced with carbon fibers. Her muscles were enhanced with synthetic cords, her respiratory system was more efficient, her reaction times were far faster, her senses keener. Humanity 2.0. There was circuitry \u2013 if you could even call it that \u2013 in her brain, biotechnic systems within her body and sensor bafflers that would provide false readings to active scanners. Weaker passive scans wouldn\u2019t even see anything different about her. Just another \u2018Broken\u2019.<br>", " <br>", "Her grin widened.<br>", " <br>", "She\u2019d been rebuilt from the ground up. <i>Abomination.</i> That was what the Compact would call her. The Askanj wouldn\u2019t have such provocative rhetoric, but they\u2019d still kill her on sight, just for existing. There was a perverse part of her that enjoyed that.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThat will be enough for today,\u201d Red One informed the woman.<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna began slowing down. The ship had told her not to push herself too hard, but it was tempting to see what she could <i>really</i> do. She needed time to adjust, though. Her limbs ached all the time and her immune system was fighting the cybernetics. If she pushed herself too hard before her treatment was finished and the implants became fully integrated, she\u2019d reduce their effectiveness, or cause an auto-immune disease that would lead to wholesale rejection. Just as well she hadn\u2019t chosen option three; Red One\u2019s initial assessment had been optimistic and her body would have rejected the regeneration therapy entirely.<br>", " <br>", "She still didn\u2019t quite know why she\u2019d accepted this ludicrous, insane, terrifying idea. To be taken apart by someone she couldn\u2019t even see and put back together only with fewer fleshy bits. Part of her had quailed at the thought, wondering if this was some kind of sick sadistic joke of Rynzler\u2019s. What had convinced her was the \u2018girl\u2019s\u2019 simple, evocative plea: \u201cYou called to me. Let me help you.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Adrianna had, but she\u2019d never meant to. She\u2019d been quite sincere in her belief when she\u2019d said that <i>Nemesis</i> was dead. All the records she\u2019d hacked into had been quite clear on that. Humanity\u2019s ultimate weapon had been a dismal failure.<br>", " <br>", "Still, the thought of it had inspired her. Every kill her Red Hand had made had been marked with old human battle-cant and warnings that <i>Nemesis</i> had returned. It had been supposed to be inspiring, to remind her \u2018soldiers\u2019 of what they could do and to inspire the population. The latter hadn\u2019t worked, but her subordinates had begun thinking of themselves as something more than smugglers and pirates... and then the Compact had found them. Two-thirds of her forces gone, just like that. Her most loyal and dedicated personnel were dead and every gain she\u2019d ever made was wiped away. She had nothing left.<br>", " <br>", "<i>I had nothing once. I made an empire.</i><br>", " <br>", "The woman\u2019s lips twisted in a snarl. She\u2019d do what she always did when she had nothing. She\u2019d take what she wanted. She came to the Cursed Red Gauntlets with nothing but the clothes on her back and she\u2019d worked her way up to stand at Vuld\u2019s side. The clan\u2019s \u2018king\u2019 been a creature of sadism, of brutality and disgusting appetites, but he had been powerful, commanding one of the larger Unbound forces and he had always needed competent submissives. It had amused him to see skill in the Broken girl, testing and testing her to see when she would fail.<br>", " <br>", "She hadn\u2019t.<br>", " <br>", "<i>The guards burst into the room, weapons raised. She turned to meet them, one hand still clutching the knife that had opened Vuld\u2019s chest. Her other arm was smeared almost to the shoulder with Tribune blood, her fingers clenched around something wet and dripping. Her skin was coated in sweat, stringing beads of it falling from her bangs into her eyes, each painful breath catching in her chest. She had several broken ribs and one lung was in danger of being punctured by the shards of bone splintered in her chest, but she would not show weakness. Not now. \u201cOur leader met with an accident,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore he died, he named me to replace him.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>They stared at her, these mercenaries and murderers, killers from a half-dozen species gaped at the slightly-built human, looking at the blood that soaked her form, her blue hair dripping with it. At the open, still-bleeding wounds that criss-crossed her flesh, bodysuit and skin both torn. At the body of their former leader, the gash that had been ripped in his chest, where something had been torn from his body. She watched them in return, daring them to challenge her. Vuld had been many things, but he had also been a supremely proficient killer. A human should not have been able to best him.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>They knelt. \u201cHail,\u201d the first of them said. \u201cHail to the queen of the Cursed Red Gaunlets.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cNo,\u201d Adrianna said, lifting her bloodied hand, letting the hewn pieces of Vuld\u2019s heart drop to the floor. Her dark eyes glittered, a thin smile coming to her lips. \u201cWe won\u2019t be called that any longer.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cThe Red Hand,\u201d another mercenary whispered.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>The human woman looked at him for a long moment and then nodded. \u201cThe Red Hand.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "She\u2019d taken what she wanted then, and she\u2019d do so now.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to stop,\u201d Adrianna hissed abruptly, sweat dripping down into her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to go back to the Red Hand and take what\u2019s mine.

The Broken was making noise \u2013 a high-pitched, staccato series of chirps. Laughter? Was she <i>laughing</i>? Jante narrowed his lower eyes. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d he demanded.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYou asked...\u201d the sow wheezed. \u201cYou asked if it was everything I\u2019d imagined?\u201d She made that grating, yelping sound again. It <i>was</i> laughter. She had gone mad.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYes, I did.\u201d the ideologue growled. \u201cYour fleet is gone. We have taken your ship. We have a full onslaught formation in this system. What can you possibly do against that?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cNothing,\u201d She laughed even harder. \u201c<i>I</i> can\u2019t do anything against that kind of firepower.\u201d She looked up at him, grinning, her small white teeth stained pink from her own blood. And just like that, the mask was gone. There was no fear, no surprise, no uncertainty. None of the trepidation and disbelief she had been wearing just moments ago remained; in its place, there was something far more predatory.<br>", "<br>", "To his credit, Jante recognized the threat, his hand going to the pistol on his hip, but he was only flesh.<br>", "<br>", "Adrianna moved. Augmented muscles flexed and he was suddenly no longer holding her. She was on her feet, driving her hand into his neck. He gagged for air and as he fell, she took his gun and opened fire. His men reacted quickly, bringing their weapons to bear in the span of heartbeats. A human would have died before she could have raised the pistol to shoot, but Adrianna hadn\u2019t been human for a very long time. She fired so quickly that it sounded like a single shot and Jante heard the heavy thuds of his soldiers\u2019 corpses hitting the deck.<br>", "<br>", "The Ideologue attempted to rise to his feet, his lungs aching as his bruised throat sucked in air, but the human came up behind him, pressing the barrel of the Janissary\u2019s own weapon against the back of his head. \u201cNo,\u201d she ordered. \u201cDon\u2019t get up.\u201d He froze where he was. \u201cMy fleet was always going to run,\u201d she told him. \u201cThose were their orders. Why would I send converted freighters and cutters up against ships of the line? That was the plan.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cA bad plan. We have taken your ship,\u201d Jante rasped, forcing a bolus of rage back down his throat. \u201cYou are one against an army.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYou took only what I gave you,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut if it\u2019s an army you want...\u201d she tapped a comm unit. \u201cSever to Flicker. Initiate.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "A few moments passed and then Jante\u2019s own comm came to life. His people were under attack. Reports were fragmentary and confused, but it was a coordinated counter-offensive, not the desperate last-ditch attempt to retake the ship he\u2019d been expecting. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d he demanded.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cWell,\u201d Adrianna said, her voice pitched low. She was almost purring. \u201cThat\u2019s a story in itself, isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "The cruiser <i>Sederin\u2019s Boast</i> wallowed drunkenly in space, its smooth curves and threatening bulk ruined by shattered hull plating and exposed internal structures, like the eviscerated corpse of a once-great prize fighter. Adrianna was sitting on <i>Naamah</i>\u2019s command, her legs crossed and fingers tented. She watched the Compact warship sputter along, the random flares of dying thrusters wobbling it back and forth. A small smile played across her lips. This wasn\u2019t the first Compact warship she\u2019d turned into a wreck, nor would it be the last.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThe legends tell us that Sederin was a hero,\u201d Adrianna said as she stood, circling the bridge. \u201cHe was unmatched in skill and courage throughout his life and became prideful, boasting of greater and greater deeds and claiming that no one could best him, no task was beyond him. Many called it arrogance, but Sederin was tested and tested again. Each time he was victorious. Until he bragged to the wrong person at the wrong time.\u201d She paused, twirling the end of one long pigtail in her hand. \u201cI\u2019ve never understood people who name ships like this. You might as well call it the <i>Invincible</i>.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cDon\u2019t humans have similar stories?\u201d Group Leader Delauz said, the reptilian Prelate carefully pronouncing each syllable. With stiff lips and inflexible tongues, the Xensiri species struggled with Compact Standard, a trait which only added to their perceived bestiality in the eyes of the more \u2018enlightened\u2019 species. Despite this, the Xensiri were extremely loyal to the Compact. A relatively recent acquisition, the Xensiri had once been mired in a truly violent civil war, which the Compact had ended when they annexed the Xensiri homeworld. Famine, disease, ethnic cleansing, a species slouching its way towards to extinction. An honest-to-God <i>actual</i> \u2018Cataclysm\u2019. Now, whenever anyone questioned whether client races could <i>truly</i> be so short-sighted as to drive themselves off a proverbial cliff, the Compact had only to point to their \u2018Prelates\u2019.<br>", "<br>", "True to their new name, the species were one of the most vocal and strident supporters of the Compact, whom they considered to be their saviours. The sickening thing was that they weren\u2019t even wrong \u2013 Adrianna had seen the original histories of the Xensiri and the Compact\u2019s own accounts. Barely anything had been changed. Prelate birth rates were among the highest of any sapient species in the galaxy \u2013 one female could lay two dozen eggs every year and the species matured quickly. They weren\u2019t as durable as Tribunes and a little too reflexively aggressive in their thinking, but they made good, loyal soldiers. Prelate regiments were often assigned to support less reliable units in battle, whether that meant shoring the discipline and morale of others, or forcing them to obey suicidal orders. It was no accident that Prelates were often shown in a positive light in Compact military fiction, often compared against humans or the other \u2018least of the unloved\u2019.<br>", "<br>", "Still, not all of the Xensiri licked the Compact\u2019s boots. There were a handful of Prelates within the Red Hand. Most of them, like Leader Iivass, Adrianna counted among her piratical element. There were a few \u2013 a very rare few \u2013 like Delauz who saw the rot inside the Compact. There had been some ruffled feather when she had chosen him, but he was a good officer and worthy of carrying her sigil when she was not aboard <i>Naamah</i>. \u201cYes,\u201d Adrianna replied. \u201cWe have Samson, who told his secrets to the wife that had betrayed him before. We have Achilles, who was utterly invulnerable, save a single spot that, once struck, instantly killed him.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYou don\u2019t name ships after them,\u201d the Xensiri observed. \u201cNot like our friends over there,\u201d he nodded towards the fading icon of <i>Sederin\u2019s Boast</i>.<br>", "<br>", "Adrianna said nothing. <i>We used to. We named our vessels after the \u2018undefeatable\u2019. You\u2019d think that in thousands of years of history, we would have learned to stop doing that.</i> \u201cScopes,\u201d she commented instead. \u201cAny movement?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cNothing, commander,\u201d <i>Naamah</i>\u2019s chief sensor officer reported. \u201cIf they\u2019re out there, they\u2019re keeping quiet.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThey are,\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a scuffle between pirates and the Compact. Nothing to get involved in and risk blowing their cover. But they\u2019re watching.\u201d She circled the upper level of the heavy cruiser\u2019s bridge. This system was unimportant, a sad little planetary nebula centered around the shrunken husk of a white dwarf with a pair of uninteresting planets orbiting it; one rocky and one gaseous. If there\u2019d been any others, the star had swallowed them hundreds of thousands of years ago when it had been a red giant, starving for hydrogen fuel and ballooning outwards. Nothing interesting, nothing to draw anyone\u2019s attention. Leblanc had only come here for <i>Sederin\u2019s Boast</i> and the only reason that the cruiser was here was because it was on their patrol route.<br>", "<br>", "There was something else here, though. She was sure of it. She\u2019d been studying intelligence reports and there was a pattern \u2013 there had been a handful of disappearances that neither her Red Hand nor any of the other cartels were responsible for. Civilian crews, pirates and mercenaries reported seeing unknown vessel and anomalous sensor contacts. It was faint \u2013 rumours and whispers, but she was sure of it. An Askanj ghost fleet was operating in this region... and it was moving towards the Magnameric Canyon.<br>", "<br>", "Ghost fleets were the nightmare of every Compact commander and system governor. Askanj ECM was better than the Compact\u2019s \u2013 it was one of the few areas that they had a definitive edge over their enemies \u2013 and they would routinely send armadas deep into the Compact\u2019s lines, avoiding sensor nets and patrol sweeps until they were ready to strike, often spending months staking out a single target, striking hard and fast before any coherent response could be mustered and then fading back into the trackless void to hit another system. Most of them were little more than deep-ranging reaver squadrons, but Adrianna believed that this one might be a bit larger than that.<br>", "<br>", "The entire fleet wasn\u2019t here, of course. It would still be deep in interstellar space, but its outriders \u2013 the scout squadrons who pressed ahead, surveying targets and watching for potential threats \u2013 would be. Well, that was what she was hoping. That was why she\u2019d taken <i>Naamah</i> off its planned operations, far from where it could be needed, to kill <i>Sederin\u2019s Boast</i> here in this nameless, unimportant system. She wanted the Principality\u2019s attention.<br>", "<br>", "Unfortunately, it seem liked they weren\u2019t prepared to give it to her. Not yet.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cPrepare a widebeam transmission,\u201d she announced. \u201cOmnidirectional. Record on my signal.\u201d She gave her Communications officer a moment to set that up, then made a \u2018begin\u2019 gesture. \u201cThis is Adrianna Leblanc of the Red Hand. Modesty prevents me from assuming you know who I am, but you\u2019ve seen my credentials. I want to talk. I think we have a lot to offer each other. If you want to stay silent, I understand. Talk it over with your Noble. When you\u2019re ready, find one of my ships. There\u2019s a lot of them throughout the Magnameric Canyon. Or you can stay quiet, continue on your way and miss out on an opportunity. Your choice.\u201d Adrianna signalled for her officer to end the recording and send it.<br>", "<br>", "Leblanc slumped back into her throne. \u201cWell,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cNow I really hope I was right, because otherwise I just wasted a month to take out one cruiser and beseech gas clouds for their aide.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cIf you are wrong,\u201d Delauz assured her, \u201cwe will simply say that the gas clouds answered back.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "As it turned out, that particular embellishment wasn\u2019t necessary.<br>", "<br>", "Just before <i>Naamah</i> shocked out-system, they received a transmission. There was no voice, no visual imagery. It was a simple piece of information, transmitted from an unknown source, containing nothing that could potentially identify the sender. The only thing in the message was coordinates... and a date. Delauz let out a considering hiss as he looked over the data, the Prelate still not full believing what he was seeing. \u201cOnly the Red Queen,\u201d he said. \u201cCould speak to the abyss and receive a reply.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Adrianna smiled, the grin of a she-wolf. \u201cThe abyss and I are good friends. We\u2019ve spent so much time staring into each other.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "<i>\u201cKursk,\u201d an immortal said, rolling the word down her tongue. \u201cIt\u2019s a little on the nose.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d the human argued.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cMost military operations don\u2019t hint at their purpose in their name.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI\u2019d agree...  if there was anyone left that knew what Kursk was,\u201d Adrianna pointed out. \u201cEven Lucas thinks it\u2019s Operation </i>Currsc<i>,\u201d the woman grinned. The word meant \u2018late breakfast\u2019 in Elamen. \u201cBesides,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s less obvious than Operation Maskirova.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cTrue,\u201d Red One agreed. There was a brief pause as if she was mulling something over, although Adrianna knew that starship had already made her considerations, run simulations, threat assessments, calculations and analyzed possibilities. It was one of the tics that she had either been programmed with or adopted from her encounters with organics. \u201cThis will not interfere with your other operations?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cMy </i>current<i> operations? Yes. But I think you\u2019ve planned for this to be something of a slow-burn.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYes.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThen I can start laying the groundwork now and build up my forces to the point that it will be a minimal disruption.\u201d Adrianna was grinning. \u201cI was planning on that anyways \u2013 this just gives me an incentive.\u201d She leaned over the holographic projection. \u201cSome of this will be beyond what I can do for you. We\u2019ll need access to some seriously heavy industry.\u201d She thought for a moment, then lifted her head. \u201cWhat\u2019s your relationship with the Principality?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cStrained,\u201d the starship admitted. \u201cOfficially, there is no relationship. Unofficially, policy towards me is equal parts avarice, antipathy and revulsion. They see me as a way to turn the tide in their war \u2013 at least, once </i>I<i> am dead and gone and they have access to my ship-self. However, they turn a blind eye when I need to... acquire... certain things from them, but this is less out of common cause than apathy.  They consider their losses a small price to pay for the havoc I wreak on the Compact.\u201d Adrianna could almost hear the shrug in Red\u2019s voice. \u201cIf they were given the opportunity, they would gladly make an attempt to seize my ship-self. I make it a point not to spend any longer within their territory than I absolutely must and to avoid needlessly antagonizing them. The lack of information sharing between the Principality and the Compact has proven useful, but if either organization realized what my goals are...\u201d she trailed off in the verbal equivalent of a shrug.<br>", "<br>", "Adrianna nodded. The briefing Red One had given her had made her head swim, equal parts enthralling and terrifying. She knew that the AI was still keeping secrets from her, but she was proud that the starship had trusted her with as much as she had. It would take time \u2013 years \u2013 to grow her Red Hand to the point that they would be ready for much of this, but the woman was determined not to fail. Red One\u2019s initial assessment had been correct. If the Compact \u2013 or the Principality, or any other star nation with an ounce of sanity \u2013 ever learned what she was planning, they would stop at nothing to destroy the starship. And they\u2019d be right to do so.<br>", "<br>", "Thoughts like that one helped ease her back to sleep on the bad nights.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI reached out to the Principality,\u201d Leblanc said, tapping her lips. \u201cWhen I first began operations in the Canyon. They turned me down. I haven\u2019t gone back since, but I think I can make another attempt. They might be more willing this time around and we might be able to get a few things from them and send them to you. If they think that they\u2019re bankrolling another Unbound cartel, that would help keep you off their radar.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cAll the unrest in the Canyon is intriguing them,\u201d Red One confirmed. \u201cI expect that they already have operatives monitoring the situation, but until something truly interesting happens, they will refrain from showing their hand.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Adrianna nodded. The Magnameric Canyon wasn\u2019t exactly counted among the Compact\u2019s crown jewels. If the sector fell off the map tomorrow, very little would be lost. If, however, the Canyon fell to </i>rebellion<i>...that blow to the ruling species\u2019 pride would be worse than the economic, military and industrial damages put together. The Principality might be enticed into financial support and supplying some of their cast-offs, but they wouldn\u2019t do more than that. Not unless something truly </i>interesting<i> began to happen.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cWell,\u201d she said huskily, envisioning the beginning of a war. \u201cThen I\u2019ll just have to see what I can do to pique that interest.\u201d</i><br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "The provided rendezvous was not in fact at the coordinates provided. The only thing of interest in <i>this</i> system was a civilian communications satellite. Utterly unremarkable \u2013 it was like every other design in the Compact, without as much as a single rivet from the Principality, but it was new: someone had placed it here within the last few days. It was also transmitting a rambling, interwoven message providing a second set of navigational data and stressing that the data was not to be shared. There were also explicit instructions to carry out the shock from a very specific point in the system. There would be a shrouded ship or ships lying in wait there, close enough that they would be able to identify her destination. If she went anywhere but those coordinates, they would follow and destroy her before she could share the data with anyone else.<br>", "<br>", "There was probably another warship watching her. The Principality\u2019s stealth technology, once considered a poor man\u2019s version of proper shrouds, was slowly but steadily pulling ahead of the Compact\u2019s designs. In lieu of vessels that could stand up to the Space Force one to one, the Principality Argosy was doing everything in their power to prevent their ships from ever being hit in the first place.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cTake us to the specified coordinates,\u201d Adrianna ordered. \u201cUse the provided navigational data. We\u2019ve been extended an invitation. It would be rude to ignore it.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "<i>Naamah</i> emerged under the guns of seven different capital ships, the lightest of them cruisers. As soon as the pirate\u2019s scopes came back up, alerts squealed through command in recognition of active sensors. \u201cMultiple target locks,\u201d Delauz confirmed, hissing in agitation. \u201cHeavy jamming, but we are able to get visual images from the nearest vessels.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cShow me,\u201d Adrianna ordered. None of the ships had opened fire; that was a good sign. In theory.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cCommander,\u201d Tactical put in. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we raise our screens?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cIf you think it will make a difference if those ships decide to open fire, then by all means,\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cNow will someone show me just who is targeting us?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Delauz chortled. \u201cImagery coming to the main screen now, commander.\u201d When she was aboard <i>Naamah</i> and among her own people, Adrianna preferred to be called \u2018commander\u2019. It was an archaic term, one that hadn\u2019t been used in the Compact for thousands of years and it appealed to her far more than \u2018majesty\u2019, \u2018highness\u2019 or any of the other associated honourifics that went with her title of Red Queen. More than one Unbound leader had killed an underling or started a clan war when someone had failed to address them with the pomposity that they felt that they deserved. She\u2019d managed to wean most of her crew off the more ostentatious descriptors, but Adrianna wasn\u2019t above pushing that issue \u2013 particularly among the other cartels \u2013 if she felt that someone was being deliberately disrespectful, but a simple \u2018commander\u2019 or \u2018queen\u2019 suited her better among her Red Hand.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThere,\u201d Adrianna said with a smile. \u201cThere you are.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Compact warships were smooth-hulled, with gentle curves only occasionally broken up by various structural features. Occasionally slightly asymmetrical, they evoked the imagery of deep ocean predators: massive, unrelenting, fast despite their size and enormously destructive. They were often given earthern hues, their dull colours broken up by pale banding and vivid squadron markings.<br>", "<br>", "The Principality\u2019s design philosophy was widely different. They gave their ships an almost avian appearance: hard angles with smoothed edges, often with prows like raptorial beaks. Many possessed flaring wings that, on larger vessels, comprised multiple decks and were filled with forward-facing railguns and weapons emplacements. Compact warships were built to engage an enemy at virtually any position in their field of fire. Askanj warships tended to focus their armament for crushing alpha strikes, hammering the foe so badly with their first exchange that they were incapable of fighting back. That was a survival mechanism; Compact warships were hard to kill \u2013 as long as the vessel was still functional, it could still fight. Compact warships always won the endurance game \u2013 they had to be taken out quickly and thoroughly. More than one \u201chulk\u201d had unexpectedly come back to life, surprising its would-be killers.<br>", "<br>", "<i>Naamah</i> was sent a route to follow, with the strict stipulation that any deviation from it would result in their destruction. Any attempt at active scanning would result in their destruction. Powering up their weapons would result in their destruction. The cruiser wound its way along the periphery of the fleet, closer watched for any sign of duplicity. Despite the number of guns trained on her ship, Adrianna was smiling.<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "They asked her to come alone. The idea of having more than the bare minimum of Unbound aboard their command ship was apparently none too palatable. It was hard to argue with that assessment and Adrianna had agreed, though there was some minor quibbling from her own crew (particularly her own guards), but she pointed out that if the Askanj wanted her dead, they had a fleet to do it with. If for some reason they wanted to kill her in person, an Askanj supercarrier held, at a bare minimum, hundreds of Legionnaires. No amount of bodyguards or armsmen would be able to protect her.<br>", "<br>", "Adrianna didn\u2019t know much about Askanj ships \u2013 most of her information on them came from <i>Nemesis</i>, but the vessel <i>Naamah</i> was led to had to be one of their supercarriers. Almost nine kilometers long, it carried enough firepower to crush an entire fleet, but had none of the staying power or defences of a Triarch\u2019s Chariot. It was very much a \u2018glass cannon\u2019, but that only meant that it fit in perfectly with the Jackals\u2019 military philosophy. Kill before you were killed.<br>", "<br>", "She was scanned quite thoroughly before allowed to leave the hangar, but it was primarily a surface scan to check her for any potential weapons or implements of destruction she might bring into the presence of their fleet\u2019s commander.  Without a more invasive sweep, the sensor bafflers built into her body would camouflaged her true nature. Fortunately, the Principality were less concerned about what was inside her than anything she might be attempting to conceal or smuggle in and after that, an unexpectedly bubbly Privilege and a pair of Legionnaires escorted the human to the wardroom of APAV <i>Maledictor</i>. The junior officer and the guards waited outside and Adrianna stepped inside.<br>", "<br>", "The Noble Fleet Mistress was a Serpent; Adrianna had had little exposure to the Askanj-<i>illth</i>, but she seemed big, even for one of their matriarchs. The fleet leader was sitting upon her coils at the head of a long, curved table, a pair of Askanj-<i>anj</i> armsmen behind her. She raised herself up at Adrianna\u2019s approach, her crest rising slightly as she sized up the Unbound commander. \u201cAdrianna Leblanc of the Red Hand,\u201d she said in acknowledgement.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYou have me at a disadvantage.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI am Noble Fleet Mistress Shines Like Fire of the Askanj Principality Argosy Vessel <i>Maledictor</i>. I hope you will forgive my lack of etiquette, but I am not familiar with Broken greetings.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cNor I with Illtharie custom. It\u2019s something that I hope to have cause to rectify.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The Serpent\u2019s crest twitched at that and she bobbed her head. Before they had joined the Principality and become Askanj-<i>illth</i>, her people had been Illtharie. Today, the use of their species name was considered archaic, but not unwelcome. As Adrianna took her seat and the Noble Fleet Mistress resumed her previous position, the human looked over the Principality fleet commander. Shines Like Fire was aptly named; she was a very rare breed of Askanj-<i>illth</i> with vivid red and yellow scales. Her yellow crest was speckled with black shapes, like sunspots against a star and her eyes were the colour of citrine.<br>", "<br>", "If the Tribunes were the soldiers of the Compact, then Askanj-<i>illth</i> were their counterparts in the Principality. Illtharie were the wolves of their world; they\u2019d evolved as communal pack hunters, swarming over prey from every angle, bringing down megafauna in writhing balls of coils, slashing claws and venomous bites. Even today, thousands of years removed from that ancestry, Serpents were masters of squadron command. Despite the Compact\u2019s traditional advantages in void war, more than one Compact Leader had died from the incessant strikes of an Askanj-<i>illth</i>-led force.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cUnbound,\u201d the Serpent said, her fingers steepled. \u201cCreatures outside the bounds of law, of society, morality, civilization or decency. We have our own pirates and raider filth, our \u2018Renegades\u2019, but not so many as the Compact. It is an endless source of amusement that a civilization that glorifies itself to the extent that yours does has so many willing to turn their back on it.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cIt should come as no surprise,\u201d Adrianna said, \u201cthat a society as regimented and oppressive as the Compact sees so many raiders. Deny someone a voice for long enough and they will lash out.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cAnd be struck down by the masters\u2019 hands,\u201d Shines Like Fire pointed out. The tip of her tail twitched. \u201cThe Compact endures.\u201d Her inner eyelids blinked. \u201cRed Queen. That is a name I have heard. At first only sparingly, another Unbound dreg with an unearned title. Then, in laughter. A Broken. A species so pitiable even the Compact sees no need to mince words with their title. <i>This</i> creature would don the garments of war? Laughable.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cBut,\u201d the Serpent\u2019s lips drew back, showing her teeth. \u201cThe laughter ended and I have heard the Red Queen spoken of with grudging respect from those that hate her. I have heard interest from our own analysts. I have heard contempt from the Compact\u2019s dogs. So, I have become interested in this title of \u2018Red Queen\u2019 and the woman who wears it. I have watched her take a sector under the thumb of the CST, inflaming minor quibbles and issues into points of violent disagreement. I have listened as she excoriates the downtrodden to stand up, the indoctrinated to think for themselves and the shackled to break their chains. I have seen her fail a hundred times, but succeed wildly in the hundred and first. And,\u201d Shines Like Fire said with an amused hiss. \u201cI have become intrigued.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI was hoping I\u2019d catch your attention,\u201d Adrianna said.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYou have. I am curious as to how you located my scouts, but we can discuss that shortly. I would be honoured if the Red Queen would join me for dinner.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Adrianna tipped her head. \u201cI would be delighted to do so, and I look forward to the conversation.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "The meal was delicious. Askanj-<i>illth</i> were almost entirely carnivores, but Shines Like Fire had accounted for her guest\u2019s needs and Adrianna had enjoyed a delightful side salad to go with her roast... whatever it had been.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThank you for your hospitality,\u201d Adrianna said as a handful of stewards appeared, cleared the table, refilled the empty glasses and vanished. \u201cWhat now, though? Do we dance around the issue of trust?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The fleet mistress chuckled. \u201cIf you are a Compact infiltrator, you are one that has cost them far more than the elimination of a single ghost fleet. Still, many of my officers believe that you are less a liberator and more a particularly successful breed of renegade. Another self-serving charlatan who cloaks herself in a raiment of lies.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI\u2019ve been underestimated since I was born,\u201d Adriann replied evenly. \u201cI\u2019ve had to prove myself since that time, too.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cSeveral of those same officers counseled me to kill you,\u201d Shines Like Fire continued, perfectly at ease. \u201cThat your knowledge of my fleet\u2019s location was a grievous security risk. But I think,\u201d her grin widened and her teeth gleamed. \u201cI think you would only betray my position if it meant feeding a pack of hounds into my guns.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Adrianna arched an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s quite... trusting of you.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cPerhaps it is.\u201d Shines Like Fire picked up a glass of water. \u201cAs I have said, I have heard of the Red Queen. I have fought for long enough to recognize a fellow predator.\u201d She took a small sip. \u201cI am not sure how much you know of my species, but we are not fond of the Triarchs, nor the hounds they set upon our worlds. We used to have a nation of our own until it was taken from us. Our worlds were stolen. Ask any woman or man of the Askanh-<i>illth</i> about the Compact and you will receive the same answer. Hate. Nothing is more honest than that. Seeing you... I believe I see the same honesty in those eyes. Am I wrong?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d Adrianna said after a moment. \u201cI grew up on Rally \u2013 the one world us \u2018Broken\u2019 are allowed to have as our own. They restrict our population growth, dictate the jobs we\u2019ll have, the places we can live, the laws we can make, what we can say and what we can watch. The \u2018non-compliant\u2019 become criminals, are given drugs to regulate their \u2018anti-social tendencies\u2019 or are sent offworld to die for the state that hates them. All for our own good. And we believe it. We believe that there is something <i>wrong</i> with anyone who doesn\u2019t follow the Compact. Because we believe them. We believe that we need them to control every facet of our lives. They pulled us back from the brink \u2013 they never get tired of telling us that \u2013 and are doing everything for our own good. Because we\u2019re too uncivilized, too stupid, too short-sighted to think and act for ourselves. We thank them for it, thank them for the \u2018burden\u2019 that they accept on our behalf. There\u2019s a word the Rally-born Tribunes have for us, you know. <i>Keb\u2019esh</i>. \u2018Sheep\u2019. I believed it too, for the longest time. I hated myself for the questions I asked. I hated even more that I was too afraid to talk to anyone else about them. I wondered what was wrong with me... and then I knew. I knew it wasn\u2019t me. It was everyone else.\u201d Adrianna chuckled, low in her throat. \u201cThat\u2019s one definition of crazy, isn\u2019t it? But I couldn\u2019t let go of that thought, no matter what I did. I ran from my world, still wondering if I was the problem. Trillions of people would say yes... but I looked at the rest of the galaxy. I looked at the Compact, its self-styled superior rulers and the chattel under their feet. I saw all that and realized that I wasn\u2019t the problem... but I was going to make sure I became one.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Shines Like Fire hissed from deep in her throat, the sound one of consideration. \u201cSo tell me, Red Queen \u2013 why have you sought out the Principality?\u201d She grinned, exposing a wide mouth of sharp incisors. Unlike the Xensiri, pre-history\u2019s Illtharie had killed their prey with a combination of venomous bites and ripping claws. As a result, their mouth and jaws developed more like those of a human rather than the dagger-mawed Prelates. The Noble Fleet Mistress\u2019s fangs were hidden, at rest inside their sockets in her upper jaw. That was actually why the Serpents generally saw smiling as a welcoming, friendly gesture \u2013 it showed the person that you were smiling at that your deadliest weapons were not ready for use. Illtharie did not trust toothless smiles, which had led to some misunderstandings when they had first joined the Principality. The Askanj-<i>anj</i> saw toothy grins as inherently threatening and only closed-mouth smiles as good-natured. Since the Illtharie were now the Askanj-<i>illth</i>, such quibbles had been readily solved. It had, however, led to the expression: \u2018Never trust a snake when you can\u2019t see her teeth.\u2019<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThe Compact has accused my government of supplying weaponry to a known terrorist organization. This, I was prepared to dismiss as another in a long line of falsehoods intended to muddy our scales. And then my scouts reported certain things to me. It is expected that Unbound and renegades will perform nonstandard modifications to their ships. What I did not expect is the nature of some of your upgrades.\u201d The Askanj-<i>illth</i>\u2019s inner eyelids blinked. \u201cYou are using Principality technology.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI use whatever I have available.\u201d Adrianna replied. \u201cDown to teeth and claws if I must.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThat\u2019s as may be,\u201d Shines Like Fire smiled, her lips closed. \u201cBut someone in my government is supplying you with munitions. This was not sanctioned.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI asked the Principality for help before,\u201d the human said with a touch of anger. \u201cI was denied, so I looked for other sources of assistance.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI am unaware of the circumstances of your discussion with anyone else in my government,\u201d Shines Like Fire pointed out. \u201cHowever, illegal arms shipments are something that concerns us greatly. There are several nations that simply throw money and resources at whatever \u2018liberation movement\u2019 crops up that particular week in the hopes of distracting or damaging the Compact. Most of these would-be revolutionaries die in short order. Others are simply criminals and use this aide to further their illicit and immoral goals. The Principality does not support any organization unless two conditions are met. That we can expect to see some return on our investment and that we can be assured of some level of trust in our agents.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYou want the good PR of funding \u2018legitimate\u2019 freedom fighters and don\u2019t want to worry that the Compact will sniff out your pipelines or get a hold of your tech.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cBluntly? Yes. Until recently, your Red Hand satisfied neither of those requirements. Your brutality is well-known, commander. We do not support those who commit atrocities.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cUnless the benefit of it outweighs the bad PR,\u201d Adrianna pointed out. She took another sip. \u201cI won\u2019t give you my source. I won\u2019t even pretend that appearing to have the official backing of the Principality hasn\u2019t been helpful. I have two questions, though. You said that \u2018until recently\u2019, we didn\u2019t meet your criteria for support. Have we done so now? Secondly, if you\u2019re going to get tarred for supporting the Red Hand no matter what you do, why not help us? I\u2019m not asking for direct military assistance \u2013 just what you give to every other proxy you use. Well,\u201d Adrianna\u2019s eyes glinted. \u201cMaybe a little more.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Shines Like Fire was silent for a moment, the tip of her tail twitching faster. Finally, she smiled widely, again flashing her mouthful of teeth. \u201cI believe,\u201d she said with approval. \u201cthat this is something that bears further thought.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "<i>Adrianna was watching the last stand of Noble Fleet Master Akrym Votan. She should be heading back to </i>Naamah<i>, but Red One had wanted to show her this last bit of information. It was, the starship had told her, the perfect example how everything could go wrong after going right.<br>", "<br>", "She\u2019d always had an aptitude for tactics. Strategy was harder. She\u2019d seen what happened to people who didn\u2019t bend, who were convinced that they were infallible and that they\u2019d covered every angle. Sath had died believing that no Broken \u2018child\u2019 could nor would raise a hand against him. Vuld had died with the realization that his azea haal<i> had never been </i>his<i> at all. She\u2019d destroyed other Unbound kings and queens, politicians and military officers the same way, but as her advisors liked to tell her, she couldn\u2019t rely on luck forever. So she studied, she listened, she learned. She\u2019d been doing that ever since she\u2019d first watched her father work, since she\u2019d first discovered that old, filth-caked archive containing data from a time before humans had been \u2018Broken\u2019. She\u2019d spent weeks cajoling the centuries-old scrap to work again, until finally grainy reams of information had appeared on her computer screen. Fragmentary and barely incoherent, at first she\u2019d thought it was some kind of forgery or elaborate hoax, but the more she\u2019d studied it for flaws, the less she\u2019d been able to explain away and the more she\u2019d delved into other proscribed material.<br>", "</i><br>", "Nemesis<i> rises.<br>", "<br>", "The woman turned her attention back to the information on display. The Askanj commander had made several errors and Bastion Leader Hdenik (and nine names besides) had destroyed the Noble Fleet Master\u2019s armada. The thing was, each mistake had been small, each one was justifiable, understandable and could easily have been made by any officer in any navy. Hdenik had made an equal number of minor missteps, but as the saying went \u2018he who makes the last mistake loses\u2019 and that had been Votan.<br>", "<br>", "Two fleets of roughly equal disposition and capability, two commanders of roughly equal skill. Theory said that any battle should have been a draw. Instead, it was known as the Slaughter of Corkhan\u2019s Crossing. Two-thirds of the Askanj fleet had been destroyed. That by itself should have been an incredible victory. Instead, it was a disaster for both sides. The Compact fleet had fared better than Votan\u2019s armada... but not by much. Hdenik herself had been killed, along with all souls on her sigil. With their command ship lost and most of its deputies taken out early on, the Compact fleet hadn\u2019t fallen back when they should have and had continued their advance, right into the range of the Askanj\u2019s energy torpedoes.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cNever assume that you know what your enemy wants and what they will do,\u201d Red One told Adrianna as the battle reached its final pitch, the mangled remains of both forces fighting on long past the point that they should have. \u201cNever think that just because you\u2019ve done everything right, things can\u2019t go wrong.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Adrianna nodded, watching as the remnants of the Compact armada managed to extricate themselves from the Askanj lines, regrouping and allowing the Jackal forces to break and run. At one point, she had entertained the idea that she was being groomed to command </i>Nemesis<i>, but she\u2019d realized how ridiculous the idea was. Red One had more combat experience than any organic officer short of a Triarch ever would, she could think and act in the time it took a human heart to beat \u2013 she\u2019d long since outgrown the need for a mere </i>captain<i>.

When he was eight, he\u2019d fallen through a sinkhole into a colony of striped vipers. Their venom wasn\u2019t nearly as deadly as that their Terran counterparts. In fact, the handful of introduced Terran snakes (and who in the <i>Hell</i> thought it was a good idea to rescue <i>snakes</i> of all things from the Cataclysm?) were the deadliest reptiles on Rally. Of course, when you were bitten by three dozen of the damned things, quantity was its own quality. There hadn\u2019t been a part of him that hadn\u2019t been bloated and aching. It had been three days before the swelling had gone down enough for him to see again. Ever since then, snakes had been on Lucas Harker\u2019s personal shit list.<br>", "<br>", "So being in a confined space with nearly twelve feet of Tribune-killing muscle, claws and scales was not his idea of a good time. Adrianna, damn her, didn\u2019t seem bothered at all by Shines Like Fire. The Noble Fleet Mistress was big, even for her species, almost three and half meters from nose to tail and the latter was over two-thirds of her body length. At rest, Shines Like Fire only came up to Lucas\u2019s chin, but that tail was all muscle and easily capable of supporting her if she chose to raise herself up.<br>", "<br>", "The Askanj-<i>illth</i> smiled toothily in greeting and slithered towards Adrianna, raising herself up just enough to look the human in the eyes. She and Leblanc clasped each other\u2019s forearms, then shook hands \u2013 one Serpent and one human greeting. Since their first meeting, Adrianna had spent time brushing up on Askanj customs. The Principality was made up of about a dozen different species, each with their own quirks, preferences and traditions. In order to ensure that everyone was represented equally, when beings from different cultures met, customs from each (where appropriate), were observed. The traditions of the host were observed first and then those of the visitors.<br>", "<br>", "Instead of the enforced common culture of the Compact, the Askanj allowed their member races to retain all their own social mores, customs, taboos and idiosyncrasies, which could often lead to misunderstandings. Although the Principality talked much about the unity of their people, the truth was that they were far less unified than they tried to present to outsiders and the Compact had ruthlessly exploited these internal divisions, once pushing the Principality to the brink of civil war. There was something to be said for having a single voice and a single direction.<br>", "<br>", "As Adrianna introduced him and Shines Like Fire introduced her own second-in-command, a slightly-built Askanj-<i>anj</i> male, Lucas repeated the greeting gestures with the alien fleet leader. Her skin was surprisingly smooth and warm. Shines Like Fire gestured towards a conference table, sitting on her own coils as her second and the two humans took their own seats. It had taken a few months since Adrianna\u2019s first meeting with the ghost fleet, but the Noble Fleet Mistress had agreed to provide some limited assistance to the Red Hand. Nothing too overt \u2013 some spare parts and a few advisers, both technical and military. In return, the cartel had offered some of the information they\u2019d gathered on Compact personnel, forces, dispositions and movements within the Canyon and its neighbouring sectors.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThank you for agreeing to meet with me on such short notice,\u201d Adrianna began. \u201cYour assistance to our war effort has already been invaluable.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cAs has the intelligence you have shared with us,\u201d Shines Like Fire replied. \u201cI was surprised to see <i>Naamah</i> on our screens so soon.\u201d She tilted her head. \u201cWhat have you discovered?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI\u2019ve received some information from our agents concerning a threat to my operations within the Magnameric Canyon,\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cI know you don\u2019t have the kind of penetration of Local Command that we do, but I\u2019m betting that your scouting operations are a lot more thorough. They may have noticed something that mine didn\u2019t.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Shines Like Fire hissed thoughtfully to herself. \u201cThis is possible. What have you discovered?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Adrianna reached into her tunic and removed a small data drive, handing it to Shines Like Fire. The Serpent passed the data to her second in command, who inserted it into a datapad. \u201cTell me,\u201d Adrianna said as the Askanj officers looked over the information. \u201cHave you heard anything about the Onthana system?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "Jante had been absolutely correct; <i>Naamah</i> had been sorely lacking in crew; the personnel that had stayed aboard the heavy cruiser as it had headed into the trap had all been volunteers, but the Red Hand\u2019s sigil ship was not as undefended as it had appeared. Hidden in sensor-shielded compartments deep within the armoured central core of the warship were nearly two thousand of Adrianna\u2019s finest killers. The Red Hand would never be a true military force, but Adrianna aggressively recruited skilled mercenaries and soldiers, her combat teams training relentlessly under professional tutelage and their recently-arrived Legionnaire advisors. If they would never be up to the standards of Janissaries, they were still a deadlier threat than most other Unbound forces. On their home ground with the element of surprise, the Red Hand forces swept through the Compact boarding teams. Even worse, that two thousand included several handpicked units of Shines Like Fire\u2019s best soldiers.<br>", "<br>", "The Compact Janissaries had prepared for the lightly armed and armoured forces that were found aboard any pirate vessels, expecting a relative handful of stolen, scavenged or inferior black market-built sets of power armour. The thought that they might encounter Askanj Legionnaires had never been considered.<br>", "<br>", "Led by the Principality counter-boarding teams, the Red Hand\u2019s forces swept through <i>Naamah</i> in a blitzkrieg, overrunning and destroying isolated Compact sweep teams and smashing through their firepoints. In minutes, every vital area of the ship was back under the Red Hand\u2019s control.<br>", "<br>", "Adrianna smiled as she listened to the reports of success. Engineering and the main computer were hers again, as well as two of the heavy cruiser\u2019s three secondary reactors. The prisoners the Compact had taken were free. \u201cThe bridge is mine,\u201d she told her soldiers. \u201cSend a replacement command crew immediately.\u201d There was a short, sharp confirmation.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cAs far as your fleet knows, <i>Naamah</i> is still under your control,\u201d Adrianna observed to the Janissary. He was still kneeling on the deck, his hands on his head. \u201cThey won\u2019t have any issue about letting us come in closer. They\u2019ll protect their prize. You\u2019ll confirm every query they send.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cNever,\u201d hissed Jante. He was shaken, but still defiant.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cTrue.

But something \u2013 someone \u2013 that sounds just like you will do that for us.\u201d Oada\u2019vam was a hard tongue for humans to speak, but Adrianna had learnt it. Vuld had insisted. There was no disguising her accent, though. Fortunately, she didn\u2019t need to. \u201cDo you think,\u201d Jante\u2019s own voice came from the woman\u2019s mouth as she activated implants and speech-mimicry protocols. \u201cThat they\u2019ll figure it out before we stick a knife in their ribs?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "<i>\u201cYou have everything?\u201d Red One inquired.<br>", "<br>", "Adrianna patted her tunic, where the \u2018drive the ship had given her sat. \u201cI think so.\u201d She was back to grinning like a schoolgirl.

It was time to head back. \u201cI\u2019ve got more than enough.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just the data Red One had provided. Until that courier had arrived in Minos Perch, Adrianna had thought \u2013 </i>known<i> \u2013 that she was alone, that it was all too likely that the revolution she was attempting to midwife would die with her. Now, though...<br>", "<br>", "Operation Kursk would take years to come to fruition, as would the rest of the warship\u2019s plans. Red One thought on a timescale greater than most living things could imagine or plan for. Because of that, they didn\u2019t see what she was doing. They patted themselves on the back when they spotted a decades-long pattern. </i>Nemesis<i> had been working on Kursk for over a century already, hiding her true operations beneath interlacing trends of attacks and offensives, serving multiple objectives at once. Some of her strikes were random, designed to confuse and frustrate enemy strategists. Some were focused on accomplishing very specific goals and some appeared to fall into both those categories and only the AI knew which served her ends and which were simple distractions. The Compact had built up and thrown away entire dossiers as they tried to predict the warship\u2019s movements. Adrianna had a chance to be a part of that now, a part of the \u2018Long War\u2019. She wasn\u2019t going to waste it. She was going to make </i>Nemesis<i> rise.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cTake your time,\u201d the AI said. \u201cAs you said, this is a slow burn.

At the Ideologue\u2019s confusion, she nodded to Operations. \u201cShow him.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The Ops officer dutifully responded, bringing up imagery of the newcomers. Askanj warships, led by a pair of supercarriers. They were already dispersing into an attack formation, aimed directly at the Compact fleet. Further down the gravity well and with their acceleration cut to swarm over <i>Naamah</i>, the Compact force had virtually no chance of escape. Fifty Space Force warships was still an unpleasant mouthful, but the pair of massive supercarriers tilted the advantage towards the Askanj. <i>Endless Stinging Swarm</i> was a drone command ship, able to deploy thousands of automated strike craft. <i>Maledictor</i> carried nothing but missiles and missile pods. By itself, it could launch nearly ten thousand missiles in a single salvo, but that would hardly be needed here.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYou did good baiting the hook,\u201d Adrianna said. \u201cReliable sources, ones who\u2019d fed us actionable intel before. That was masterful. Were the agents that sent the information ever ours? Did you find out about them later and feed them false information, or was one ours and one yours?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose it matters, but I just wanted to say that your counter-intelligence operation... it was good. A hidden outpost, constructed in secret? It was just the right mixture of desperation and cunning to ring true. The kind of threat that I would have to respond to, powerful enough that I\u2019d need most of my ships. It sounded so perfect, so... <i>true</i>. That\u2019s what made me wonder. So I reached out to a friend. We only had the intel you\u2019d fed us, but she\u2019d noticed your ship movements and deduced that you were preparing for some kind of assault. She thought you\u2019d caught her scent and were readying a counter-attack if she moved on the Canyon. Each of us only had half the picture. You fooled us both.\u201d She smiled cruelly. \u201cUntil we talked.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The woman let a moment pass in silence. The Tribune remained silent, biting back his anger. Adrianna gestured to her communications officer. \u201cListen,\u201d she purred. \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201c-<i>Adjucator\u2019s Resolve</i>,\u201d the Compact fleet leader was saying. \u201cThis is Compact territory. We have jurisdiction here. Withdraw immediately or we will engage your ships.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThat\u2019s the sound of terror,\u201d she said softly. \u201cA man who knows he is about to die, but is desperately trying to think his way out of it. That\u2019s the irony, you know. He did everything right. He brought more than enough ships here, just in case I had a larger fleet than anticipated. He focused his assault on the greatest threats, he didn\u2019t thin out his forces. Your leader did everything right... and it\u2019s not going to help him.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "When the response from the Askanj fleet finally came in, it left nothing to the imagination. \u201cOh, leader,\u201d Shines Like Fire chirred with amusement. \u201cPlease do.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cLet me show you the future,\u201d the Red Queen whispered to Jante. \u201cYour forces are spread across the Canyon trying to put out every single fire I\u2019ve started. You\u2019re about to lose a full onslaught formation here and then this ghost fleet will cut its way through the sector and beyond. In its wake, my Red Hand will feed. It will be months before the Compact can drive us from the space lanes and we\u2019ll use that time to grow, preying on all those worlds that you left helpless. Our claws will sink into every system, infesting and corrupting. Once they\u2019re victorious, your superiors will clap themselves on the back, proud of how quickly they brought order back to this troubled sector, but they\u2019ll make the same mistake you did. They\u2019ll see us run and think it\u2019s because we\u2019re frightened, outgunned and unwilling to stand against them. All the while, we\u2019ll still be here. In the shadows, in the soil of every world we\u2019ve touched. Growing stronger. And then...\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The Tribune turned his head towards her. Hatred, revulsion and comprehension glinted in all four of his eyes. \u201cThe fire will rise,\u201d he said, pronouncing each world with loathing. His muscles tensed. He was getting ready to make his move.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d Adrianna purred. \u201cIt will.\u201d Her finger gently squeezed the trigger.<br>", "<br>", "Handing the oversized pistol off to her armsmen, the Red Queen gestured to a pair of ratings. \u201cGet that out of here.\u201d They hurried to drag Jante\u2019s body away as Leblanc tapped her comm. \u201cSever to Flicker. Status?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cAll primary objectives secure,\u201d Flickers Through Grass reported. \u201cSeveral secondary sites have been taken. We are making a final push on the last coils of resistance. Your ship is yours, Red Queen.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThank you, Overseer. The Legion is every bit as capable as I have heard. Several Compact warships are moving in to tether us. I suspect they\u2019re trying to escape with their prize. We\u2019ll hold fire until your Noble Fleet Mistress engages the Compact. Once we do, things will get... bumpy.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cUnderstood,\u201d the Legionnaire replied. \u201cWe will be prepared.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cGood. I\u2019ll leave you to the hunt.\u201d She offered the Legionnaire an Askanj-<i>illth</i> benediction. \u201cStrike with vigour, Overseer.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Closing the channel, Adrianna took her place on her command throne. \u201cOperations, confirm engine readiness for high energy maneuvers. Guns, go over our functional weapon batteries and draw up a shooting solution based on that. I want to wait until the Askanj missiles are just outside the Compact\u2019s engagement zone before we engage. I want them as distracted as possible.\u201d There was a flurry of activity as the bridge crew hurried to prepare the stricken <i>Naamah</i> for battle. Adrianna ran her fingers along the arm of her command throne. This ship had been good to her, but she doubted it would be worthwhile to salvage it after this. The Compact would have done it as a point of pride, but the heavy cruiser\u2019s damage was beyond what her outfitting facilities were capable of repairing. <i>One last hunt,</i> she promised the wounded warship. <i>One last battle together, then you can sleep.</i><br>", "<br>", "The Red Queen steepled her fingers, watching as the Compact fleet clustered around their prize, still believing it to be under their control. The fleet was changing formation, a shell of escorts dispersing to take the brunt of the assault while the heavier vessels fled down Onthana\u2019s gravity well, looking to buy time and distance until they could flee. It was a small hope, but it was the only one that they had. <i>Naamah</i> shuddered as the heavy cruiser was dragged behind a trio of capital ships. <i>Adjucator\u2019s Resolve</i> was informing Jante to prepare to abandon the ship if need be. She answered in the dead Ideologue\u2019s voice, confirming the orders to bring her back alive if nothing else.<br>", "<br>", "The task force\u2019s leader was loathe to abandon his prize, but they would be forced to cut the wreck loose very soon. Still, if by chance he were to survive, her opposite obviously wanted something to show for the disaster this mission had suddenly become. Adrianna tapped her forefingers together. His hesitation was going to give her the opening she needed. A touch of irony; if they abandoned the heavy cruiser, she wouldn\u2019t have this opportunity to stick a knife in their ribs. If they\u2019d simply destroyed her, she wouldn\u2019t have a few weapons still functional. She hadn\u2019t counted on either of those things, but she had prepared for them. That was why her best crew hadn\u2019t been on the bridge when its personnel had been massacred.<br>", "It was why there were two thousand of her soldiers and Legionnaires wiping out the last of the Compact boarding teams and a Principality fleet was about to annihilate a quarter of the sector\u2019s best and brightest.<br>", "<br>", "If there had been an incomplete citadel here, she would have destroyed it and apologized to Shines Like Fire for the waste of time this had been. If the Compact had been determined to destroy the ship, she would have abandoned <i>Naamah</i> entirely, sacrificing it to the enemy\u2019s guns and still launching the ambush. <i>Never assume,</i> she remembered. <i>Always anticipate.</i><br>", "<br>", "Instead...<br>", "<br>", "<i>I will be your general.</i><br>", "<br>", "Range counters wound down as <i>Naamah</i> was pulled towards the Compact\u2019s sigil vessel. Adrianna bit her lip, her eyes glinting as she watched the Askanj missiles streak in. \u201cGuns,\u201d she whispered huskily. \u201c<i>Now.</i>\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "Lucas paused, taking a breath to steady himself as he reached towards the door chime. He pressed it once to announce himself, then stepped into the lounge. Like its predecessor, <i>Kubikajiri</i> had one of its observation lounges converted into a miniature arbouretum. Few other than the handful of humans aboard the ship ever came here. As it had been before, it was an unspoken edict from their queen, something quiet and beautiful. Every time he entered the room, he was reminded of springtime, when the coastal moors of his childhood came into full bloom. That was a lifetime ago; he didn\u2019t even know if he actually remembered the scent of those fields or if he only thought he did.<br>", "<br>", "He half-bowed to the figure sitting on one of the observatory\u2019s couches. \u201cCommander.\u201d Outside, the scarlet light of the Crimson Shawl glittered in, bathing the entire deck in faint red hues. Silhouetted against the nebula were a handful of <i>vassa anka</i> and first two <i>kiran shren</i>. The Red Hand\u2019s newest ships, their \u2018blood born\u2019.<br>", "<br>", "Adrianna Leblanc stirred, tilting her head towards her second in command. \u201cLeader.\u201d She looked so young. There wasn\u2019t a single wrinkle, crow\u2019s foot or grey hair on her. She hadn\u2019t aged a day since her return from Unicorn Set all those decades ago. Humans were rare enough in the galaxy that few had even noticed and even fewer would think that anything was amiss. There were more than a few nonsapient species where one sex outlived the other. Who knew enough about Broken physiology to say that the Red Queen <i>shouldn\u2019t</i> appear this way? And if anyone did, then they also knew that Leblanc was not quite a baseline human \u2013 her hair was proof enough of that. That was the story anyone who asked was given, but it wasn\u2019t the whole truth.<br>", "<br>", "It wasn\u2019t just the genetic modifications. In his quieter moments, Lucas had wondered if this woman was the same girl he had seen so many years before. If \u2013 to use a touch of poetry \u2013 the fire that burned in her was actually hers. Not that he was the same man he had been, either. That wasn\u2019t a comment on his own changes as a person, but the physical differences. From the elbow down, the flesh of his right arm was pale and pigmentless as was that half of his torso and face. His right eye was a prosthetic implant.<br>", "<br>", "It had happened on Verdaun. They\u2019d been ambushed by forces from an rival cartel. He didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d survived the attack, let alone lived long enough to reach a doctor. That was a small irony \u2013 humans were not the most physically imposing of sapient species, but they took to regenerative therapies better than almost any other species. Still, as his eye and mismatched skin attested, it wasn\u2019t a perfect job. He\u2019d never been the best soldier out there and as he got older, he was getting slower. But Adrianna...<br>", "<br>", "\u201cCommissioner Delk\u2019un released a statement announcing that the last of the seditionists in the Magnameric Canyon were crushed,\u201d Adrianna said, still watching the movements of her armada and the gleaming of the stars beyond the Crimson Shawl. \u201cIt only took them twenty-one years.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Lucas said, coming around the sofa to sit next to her. \u201cWe also received some communications from our cells in the Canyon. They went to ground just before the start of Operation Clean Brush. Our infrastructure there is mostly intact.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Leblanc smiled that she-wolf\u2019s grin. \u201cGood.\u201d True to her predictions, the Magnameric Canyon had burned. Shines Like Fire had swept through the Canyon, smashing every Compact military installation and vessel that she could find, retreating and drawing the Compact\u2019s fleets after her. The Serpent had led her pursuers on a two-year chase as she rampaged through Compact space, drawing every available ship and asset after her before she was finally forced to retreat back to Principality lines.<br>", "<br>", "In the months it took the Compact to re-establish space superiority in the Canyon, the Red Hand had run rampant. Their new weapons had entered mass production and they had replaced on all their losses in Onthana, even swelling the size of their fleet. They\u2019d sent tendrils into nearby sectors. Another two Unbound cartels had bent their knees to the Red Queen. Profits from smuggling and piracy had increased dramatically.<br>", "<br>", "Nor had the revolution been neglected. True to her word, Adrianna had been moving slower in the years leading up to Onthana, preparing the way for the mass uprisings that followed in the wake of the destruction of the Canyon\u2019s military forces. Some of them hadn\u2019t even required the Red Hand\u2019s influence as discontent, fear and anger all bubbled to the surface. It had taken months for the Compact re-establish military control of the sector. The Magnameric Canyon had no real strategic value and it had been deemed that stopping the ghost fleet was of higher priority than quashing the \u2018handful\u2019 of malcontents, opportunists and pirates that the local government and CST commissioners assured their superiors were behind the incidents. When officials who weren\u2019t in the CST\u2019s pocket were able to get their reports heard, the Compact had been less than happy to know how bad the situation truly was. Those it deemed responsible became examples. Resignations, yes. Dishonourable discharges. Prison sentences. Public shaming. Even an execution or two.<br>", "<br>", "That was a good narrative; it wasn\u2019t anger at systematic oppression and subjugation. It was the result of mismanagement and incompetence that had led to a hundred worlds rioting. Those at fault were not self-aggrandizing, racist hypocrites. They were corrupt. They had abused their authority. They had been suborned, they were disloyal. How else could they have let this sector descend into anarchy? How else could they have let the Principality funnel weapons to one of their cats\u2019 paws and miss the presence of a ghost fleet on their very borders?<br>", "<br>", "It wasn\u2019t the <i>system</i>, it was the fault of a few bad seeds. Sorrowful speeches were made about failures in their duty of care and the public was given their pound of flesh as the worst offenders were punished. Nor was it limited to humility. The displays of violence were held up as examples of the worst type of uncivilized behaviours that the Compact strived to help its client races develop beyond. They were admonished for listening to demagogues and charlatans, for throwing their lot in with the lies of a mentally unstable Unbound. They were told to work within the system, to allow it to heal itself. That such displays of savagery only proved that they were not truly civilized yet, but the Compact would, in its infinite beneficence, forgive them. They were young and did not fully understand everything. They would learn. All they had to do was to allow the Compact to <i>help</i> them learn.<br>", "<br>", "Promises were made, committees were formed. Many of the would-be revolutionaries had laid down their arms at this appeasement. In a gesture of magnanimity, amnesties were offered, sentences were commuted and more speeches were made about reconciliation and a \u2018time of healing\u2019.<br>", "<br>", "Those who still fought, who refused to believe the smooth lies and shaded truths were labelled as terrorists and Unbound. In the years that followed, many were hunted down and killed. The Compact was very good at this game and it had cost Adrianna more than she wanted, but a solid core of her resistance remained in place. Fighting the good fight. Literally or figuratively. With bombs or petitions and anti-Compact propaganda. Revolutionaries and activists, each fought in their own way, a legacy that the Compact hadn\u2019t been able to wipe away. The Magnameric Canyon had burned. It had taken the Compact two decades to douse the flames, but even then... embers remained. The Red Hand\u2019s legacy, etched in hearts and minds: <i>They can be hurt. They are not invincible.</i><br>", "<br>", "Since then, the Red Hand had grown faster than almost any other Unbound cartel ever had. They had at their disposal more firepower than some star nations. They were still far from the largest clan, but they were among the most feared. Their Red Queen had learned much from the Canyon, from every mistake and every victory. Every loss and every triumph. Aboard <i>Kubikajiri</i>, she carried out her campaigns, drawing in mercenaries and idealists in equal measure. The lost, the forgotten, the damned, terrorists and freedom fighters, monsters and madmen. No matter who or what they had been before, once they became part of the Red Hand, they were reborn as soldiers. Everywhere they went, they spread discord and strife, fanning the flames of rebellion. Here, they distributed anti-Compact literature. There, they assassinated politicians. Here, they funneled money towards activists. There, they turned the spaceways red as their warships hunted with wild abandon.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYou brought me something else,\u201d Adrianna guessed. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Lucas handed her a datascroll. \u201cA message from Understone sector. They\u2019ve accepted our offer of assistance and request that we act \u2018with all appropriate speed\u2019.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "She looked over the message. She\u2019d offered her help to the sector once before, but they had turned her down. Now, the rebels were realizing just how bad things were going to get. \u201cThen we\u2019ll do so,\u201d she said. \u201cTell them that I want everything \u2013 <i>everything</i> \u2013 they have on the disposition of local military assets. As a gesture of goodwill, we\u2019ll send our Understone associates a care package and some advisors. That should help until we arrive. Let our in-sector agents know that I want lines of communication and shipment set up and ready to go the instant we move and make sure the local cartels are aware that I expect them not to interfere. I want to slip into Understone like a glove.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Lucas nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll set everything up personally, commander.\u201d He turned to go, then paused. \u201cWar?\u201d he asked.<br>", "<br>", "Adrianna looked over her shoulder at him, smiling like a wolf. \u201cRevolution.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "<i>I have had allies before. Temporary alliances, born out of necessity. All too often they ended badly. Greed or fear was their downfall. Those who coveted what I am, those who feared it. Trust is something that I have found to be in short supply. I have long since stopped hoping that I will find more than a single ally. My sister, what there is left of her, requires me to kill her over and over. The people I was built to protect see me as a horror that must be destroyed. Other nations desire my technology. My alliances, such as they are, are always short and all too often they end in death.<br>", "<br>", "I have survived, though. I have lived for two thousand years, raining fire and destruction upon my enemy and I will continue to do so until I have been destroyed. Now, though... now I have found a kindred soul, one who burns as deeply as I do. I wonder sometimes, if I will ever find anyone else like her. Others who will burn as I do. I do not dream, but sometimes I imagine this coming to pass. A legacy, a hope for the future beyond my Long War. It\u2019s foolish, but still... I imagine it.<br>", "<br>", "Until that day comes, there is still the Red Queen. She and all those who follow her will carry the torch when I finally fall. That will have to be enough.<br>", "<br>", "The fire rises. One day, it will be an inferno. I cannot say when, or even if it will happen, but it is what both of us fight for.<br>", "<br>", "And everyone will burn with us.</i></div>"]}
