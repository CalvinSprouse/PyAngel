However, most of those were contaminated by radiation, choked off by debris, sealed by quarantine orders or were otherwise unusable. Fortunately, one of the few remaining scout probes had found a viable corridor. Faithful Trenis stood just outside the connecting hallway, frowning as he eyed the results of a handheld scope. This part of the ship had power; the lighting here was constant and the sound of the gravity plating was barely perceptible. He found himself strangely anticipatory, like a child awaiting gifts on the Eve of Lights.<br>", " <br>", "The faithful continued to study the readouts. So far, there\u2019d been no headway made on translating the alien language. Understandable, since there were few linguists aboard <i>Bequeathed</i>. Trial and error had been teaching him and his people. It seemed that this was just one of many small side passages that connected to the main reactor core. There didn\u2019t appear to be any surprises, but Trenis had learned that underestimating the twitches of this corpse could be costly. One of the few remaining drones was sent in first, its spindly arms dangling beneath it, the manipulator digits tapping at a keypad. The first door opened and the probe floated in, its many sensor eyes taking in the corridor. This was different from the others; instead of the slate grey of the ship\u2019s normal bulkheads, these were a glossy greenish-white. Even the floor and ceiling were made of the same material.<br>", " <br>", "Trenis nodded to himself. A scan chamber, there to ensure that anyone who approached the central core did so only with the proper authorization. Whatever security protocols that had existed were no longer functional; the door at the end of the room was open and the probe passed through it without incident. The faithful brought up the drone\u2019s feed on his gauntlet, the holo image springing to life in the air. Those human and Tribune engineers that lacked the telemetry clustered a little tighter around the faithful as they stared at the images.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat do you have?\u201d Group Leader, Submissive Ashtun asked. He\u2019d joined the team as soon as he\u2019d heard that they\u2019d found a possible way in.<br>", " <br>", "Trenis couldn\u2019t answer the submissive; not right away. He was ensorcelled by the probe\u2019s data, calling up sub-screens so that he could watched multiple camera feeds. Finally, he looked up at the waiting officer. \u201cWhat are you seeing, faithful?\u201d Ashtun demanded.<br>", " <br>", "The engineer\u2019s mouth was dry; he had to lick his lips before answering, technical journals and experimental protocols running through his mind. \u201cI can\u2019t be sure,\u201d he said at last. \u201cNot until we get in there... but I think... I think we are looking at the Compact\u2019s destiny.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Grace laid out everything she\u2019d come to believe about the ship \u2013 the patterns of injuries and deaths steering them away from some sections, the ease at which others had opened up. It was nothing; just guesswork, theorizing and coincidences. She felt foolish even saying it aloud, but the pack leader didn\u2019t interrupt her, didn\u2019t dismiss her. He merely listened with a thoughtful expression on his face, the nearly-empty flask forgotten at his feet.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou\u2019re on light duties,\u201d he said at last. \u201cPending medical release and the resolution that business with Kilgrave.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The young woman\u2019s cheeks flushed at the reminder. \u201cYes, patron.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham closed his daylight eyes. \u201cI have little to do myself now that submissive Ashtun has taken charge of the salvage operation.\u201d He\u2019d intended to return to <i>Bequeathed</i>, replace his pills and have the doctors increase the dosage. He was still tempted to do that, but the earnest way the human spoke, the conviction in her voice...<br>", " <br>", "...she had seen it, too. A glimpse of it. Nasham rubbed his throat, feeling the familiar, unpleasant tightness there. The dreams had been coming back for a long time; every dose only pushed them back a little further. He had been running from them for a long time. Part of him wanted to keep running, but he forced himself to look at the tiny, ugly little human that stood before him. She was willing. Bred for docility and obedience, she had enough iron in her liver to look into the Black \u2013 what did that say about him?<br>", " <br>", "Fine.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWell, sectator,\u201d he said at last. A mirthless smile came to his lips as he looked at the human. \u201cUntil such time as you are cleared to return to your regular duties, you will be reporting directly to me. Start an investigation into this pattern of yours. Tell me \u2013 and <i>only</i> me \u2013 what you find. If it is nothing, then we can both breathe a sigh of relief.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes, patron,\u201d the human paused, biting her lip. \u201cBut... what if it\u2019s not?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThen,\u201d Nasham sighed heavily. \u201cWe pray to the Triarchs for deliverance.\u201d <i>But not mercy,</i> the heretical thought came unbidden to his mind. <i>For the gods have none.</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "It was a terrible sort of wonder Trenis felt as his large hands tighten on the railing. Like every other part of the ship, it was set for creatures smaller than Tribunes, but the chief engineer scarcely noticed. He was staring down at the central reactor. This chamber was huge, almost large enough to hold a ship itself and just looking down triggered a sense of vertigo in the Tribune. This engineering section was built much like the secondary reactor had been, but on a much grander scale: the power core in the middle of the room, walkways, balconies and gantries along the walls like the ribs of some great beast, others criss-crossing the chamber to form platforms, service stations and work terminals. The small worker-things skittered across the walls and machinery and Trenis could see larger things. Some were barely the size of a human, others larger kin to the swarming machines, massive arachnid constructs that crawled along the machinery, ignoring the Compact technicians utterly. Trenis felt a trickle of ice nest within his liver as he imagined those automations roused to anger as the smaller swarm had been, but he pushed the thought aside, staring back over the edge of his platform.<br>", " <br>", "It wasn\u2019t <i>down</i> that so concerned him at the moment. He had diverted every engineer, technician and specialist that he could lay hands on to this chamber and it was already swarming with <i>Bequeathed</i>\u2019s crew, humans and Tribunes crawling over walkways and mezzanines, studying the active computer panels or gawping at the bounty before them... most enraptured by the same thing that held Trenis\u2019s attention.<br>", " <br>", "Angled towards the center of the chamber like clutching talons, eight massive arms reached out from the walls, each of them so large that a score of men could have walked abreast along them. Each ended into a splayed, clutching talon-like structure, forming an open cage around the empty air at the center of the vast chamber, itself large enough to hold a battle tank.<br>", " <br>", "Trenis felt adrenalin flush through his veins as he tried to convince himself of what he had seen, theoretical diagrams and hypothetical schematics from his journals flashing through his mind. Primitive, bestial things compared to the wonder he was looking upon.<br>", " <br>", "This wasn\u2019t pitiable fission, common fusion or antimatter or the exotic build of a plasma tap. It wasn\u2019t any of the hundred ways that he\u2019d seen ships power themselves. It was something else, something he\u2019d never imagined, something that stoked every engineer\u2019s dream he\u2019d ever had and made another part of him quail at the thought of such power.<br>", " <br>", "It was a breach core.<br>", " <br>", "He was looking upon the point where a chained shockpoint would be born, forced into life from the vessel\u2019s other power reserves. Once it had been created, the howling sin against creation was lashed into servitude, the power that bled from it feeding the ship that had enslaved it. It was an impossible thing, something that the Compact had sought for generations but never mastered. No one in the galaxy had. Not the Askanj, not the Harrimun or the Yengesae. No one... but this vessel\u2019s builders.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBeautiful,\u201d Trenis said, enraptured by the artistry of it all. \u201cBut how did you do it?\u201d He rubbed his chin, everything but the wondrous thing before him vanishing from his senses.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIf I\u2019m reading this right,\u201d Allyria mused, though she wasn\u2019t entirely sure that she was. <i>Nemesis</i> had changed her command deck\u2019s displays into Varan script, but Allyria hadn\u2019t used her native written language since she\u2019d been taken from her homeworld. She only knew a bare handful of half-remembered ancient human \u2013 English, the machine had informed her \u2013 phrases and the Angel seemed to have no desire to use Compact Standard. \u201cThen you\u2019ve almost drawn enough power from the star and your secondary reactors for a restart of your primary power core.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d the Angel replied. \u201cIf <i>Bequeathed</i> had not arrived, I would have done just that. I am holding enough power in reserve to do so if I need to, but I prefer to play the cripple. I have other systems that need tending and I\u2019d prefer not to engage in precipitous behaviour quite yet.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Allyria frowned, thinking. She was even less technically inclined than Grace, but even she was seeing a problem. \u201c<i>Bequeathed</i> isn\u2019t a salvage ship. The portable generators the boarding teams brought aren\u2019t anywhere near powerful enough to give you what you\u2019d need. They\u2019d need to feed into your capacitors for days to give you the boost you\u2019re looking for. In fact, the only other source of power big enough is...\u201d she trailed off, her head coming up. \u201cOh.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOh indeed,\u201d purred the AI.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Trenis made a growl of disappointment at he stared at one of his team\u2019s computer monitors, confirming what he thought he saw on the bestial scribbling on the dead ship\u2019s own monitor boards. If the alien displays were correct, then the vessel <i>should</i> have had enough power to trigger a restart of the central core itself. That it hadn\u2019t done so already suggested two possibilities: it couldn\u2019t, or it wouldn\u2019t. The latter was likely to due to some programming constraint in the gestalt; the vessel needed a crew to operate the main core. That was an odd decision by the ship\u2019s creators. The Tribune couldn\u2019t think of any reason why the vessel would be so inhibited. Which suggested that <i>couldn\u2019t</i> was more likely; the vessel was a wreck. The damn thing was probably hemorrhaging power from somewhere \u2013 in all likelihood several somewheres \u2013 and nothing but the barest dregs were reaching the central core.<br>", " <br>", "As he glared at the meaningless lizard-scratches of the alien languages, Trenis was certain that that was what he was looking at \u2013 alerts indicating just where all the vessel\u2019s energy was being lost. There were a lot of them \u2013 more than he had personnel or crew to take care of. Even with a fully-equipped salvage team, those kinds of repairs could take weeks, even months and without main power, it was going to be an uphill struggle to patch every faulty conduit.<br>", " <br>", "Without the jumpstart to initiate the breach, the hulk was running on its secondary reactors and whatever power it could absorb from the Terrahope that it <i>wasn\u2019t</i> bleeding back out into space. The cautious part of him knew that that would be time well spent; studying every inch of this vessel, learning fully about each and every system. There was another part who wanted to see it all now, to be the first to unlock this wreck\u2019s secrets. Trenis knew why the group leader was waiting to alert local command and although he didn\u2019t share Usul\u2019s ambition, the faithful still resented the idea of others coming here and taking away what was his.<br>", " <br>", "He had not exaggerated when he\u2019d spoken to Ashtun; this vessel was the Compact\u2019s destiny and he wanted \u2013 needed \u2013 to see what more it had to offer. That would not happen until they could get the vessel operational again and to do <i>that</i>, they needed the main reactor to come back on-line.<br>", " <br>", "Trenis stared at the dormant core, grinding his teeth. He had an idea about that, but he was sure that Usul was not going to like it...<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The Verrish looked over at <i>Bequeathed</i>\u2019s icon. \u201cYou think they will?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI think that if your commander was so concerned about proper procedures, he would have sent for assistance the moment he found me. However, this may be a bridge too far for him.\u201d The AI made a soft sigh. \u201cMy fire-control sensors are close to minimal operational levels. Despite the range,\u201d one of Allyria\u2019s tintas flicked in amusement at hearing the ship so offhandedly dismiss Group Leader Usul\u2019s \u2018safe distance\u2019. \u201cI still cannot be sure of a kill shot. I so have a better chance of destroying <i>Bequeathed</i> than I did when you first arrived, but I still have no capacity for follow-on salvos. If your group leader had been \u2013 or is \u2013 of a mind to do so, he could destroy me. I\u2019ve been dangling treasures in front of them and they\u2019ve been following dutifully along. Given what I\u2019ve seen so far, I believe that they will.\u201d A beat. \u201cBut I am keeping sufficient power in reserve, just in case.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Usul bit the inside of his lip as he considered the issue before him. The derelict\u2019s main core was dead, but whatever damage had caused it to shut down was not impairing its functionality \u2013 at least as far as the initial survey indicated. Usul suspected that faithful Trenis might be erring on the side of optimism. Still, the engineer had never cut corners before and his preliminary assessment of the reactor appeared quite thorough, enough to stoke Usul\u2019s own visions. A breach core. A genuine, working breach core.<br>", " <br>", "Unfortunately, it needed a jump-start. The hulk\u2019s internal power grid was too damaged and scattered to properly feed the primary reactor the charge it needed to begin the breach and Trenis had assured him that none of the machinery that the work teams or <i>Bequeathed</i> itself carried would be suitable. Only a direct core tap from the cruiser\u2019s own reactors would suffice. That would be a very costly, very time-consuming operation with the potential to go horribly wrong at any one of a dozen different points.<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune balanced a stylus between his fingers as he considered the issue. <i>Bequeathed</i> was not a proper salvage or repair ship (and even those performed taps very rarely); it would require extensive work to prepare the cruiser for such a procedure and the... unstable nature of the wreck was an even greater cause for concern. Yes, \u2018go horribly wrong\u2019 summed up the possible consequences of this plan quite readily. Still... local command had only two vessels that could run taps themselves. One of them was the <i>Mortician\u2019s Dismay</i>, a ship so dilapidated it made <i>Bequeathed</i> look positively newborn. Usul \u2013 and by extension Seyr \u2013 wouldn\u2019t trust a tap to that wreck and <i>Remoulder</i> was a mobile construction facility, always at one job or another. It was entirely possible that the fabricator wouldn\u2019t even be available...<br>", " <br>", "Finally, Usul came a decision and commed his Operations master. \u201cContact Faithful Trenis and tell him to begin preparations for an umbilical connection,\u201d he said. \u201cRemind the faithful that he is to check, double-check and triple-check every stage of work with this rotting corpse. I won\u2019t have my ship damaged because of some spasm that somebody forgot to account for. Let our own engineers know to prepare the vessel for a core tap, but we will not proceed without my explicit orders.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cConfirmed, patron. Will there be anything else?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes. Update our courier\u2019s information,\u201d Usul informed the Broken. \u201cEnsure all transcripts, technical reports, casualty lists and data spools are included and send the drone to Column Leader Prime Seyr at Kindrigan. Note that we are proceeding with preparations for a core tap to restore functionality to the vessel. If support arrives before preparations are done, they can handle the tap. If not, we\u2019ll see about bringing this ship back to life ourselves.\u201d <i>That should bring Seyr running.</i> \u201cConfirm security levels and dispatch.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes, patron. Beginning update now. Did you wish to be informed prior to the go order?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo, just send the damned thing once you\u2019re finished.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAcknowledged, group leader.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Usul signed off with a grunt, bring the derelict\u2019s image back up on his monitor. \u201cI\u2019ve found you,\u201d he said, lacing his fingers together. \u201cI\u2019ve claimed you and made my mark. I suppose it couldn\u2019t hurt to give you a little something back for all that...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Allyria stripped out of her clothes, crawling onto the bunk. It was too small for her, but she\u2019d slept on human-sized beds before. She\u2019d protested that she wasn\u2019t tired, but her aching body had put the lie to that claim for her. <i>Nemesis</i> had insisted that she rest, that she needed to be at her peak \u2013 an exhausted, sluggish Verrish would be no use at all to her. Allyria had agreed, though she didn\u2019t know how she was going to sleep. The day had been... it had been everything.<br>", " <br>", "She\u2019d given the Angel the first set of names; most of them were from her squad. Troublemakers and malcontents whom the Compact stuffed into uniform, destined for deployment far from home. The first name she\u2019d chosen had been Grace\u2019s. She knew that her friend believed in the Compact, but she deserved a chance. Grace and her mother had given her one. Allyria was also certain that the ship had known why she\u2019d selected Grace, but the machine hadn\u2019t commented. <i>You do have a soul,</i> the Verrish thought, exhaustion already starting to creep over her. Her limbs felt like lead weights as she sagged onto the mattress. It smelled like dust and ozone, but it was heaven compared to the perspiration and salt-stained sheets of the bivouac.<br>", " <br>", "A thought occurred to her. \u201cWhat,\u201d she said, fighting to keep her eyes open. \u201cWhat do I call you? Are you <i>Nemesis</i>? Did your makers give you a name?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cMy official designation was Red One,\u201d the ship answered. \u201cHowever, many of my crew simply called me \u2018Red\u2019.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cRed,\u201d Allyria rolled the syllable down her tongue. She smiled. \u201cYes, I can see that...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "She was asleep seconds later.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>Seven names.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>It\u2019s not a lot, but it\u2019s a start. I have never tried to separate a human from the Compact before. This will be a challenge. I return to one of the names on the list, running over my comm intercepts and memory files. Grace Alice Proctor. I know why Allyria chose her. I also know what the likely outcome will be, but I always bargain in good faith. I will try.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>A thought occurs, a spark of intuition. If I had lips, I suppose I\u2019d smile. I\u2019ll try something different with her. Something more... personal. Yes, we\u2019ll try that. The others... we\u2019ll see what buttons I can push. I will whisper to them, as I whisper to their comrades. Some will go mad. Some will break \u2013 they always do. But I have never tried this before. I will try it. And as I do...</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>I will repair. I will rearm. I will take what my enemy so generously offers and then I will kill them.

In the middle of the room was the holo tank, the one that had showed the Verrish astronauts their future. This ship... she was older than anything Allyria had ever known. She had lived longer than some civilizations. She had been waging war against the Compact for two thousand years, fighting them with every pulse of her magnificent heart. They had been trying to kill her for two millennia and she had endured, a single soul defying the will of an empire.<br>", " <br>", "The young woman was overwhelmed and she fell to her knees, tears glistening in her eyes.

She should be there and not at the bottom of an elevator shaft.<br>", " <br>", "They hadn\u2019t even bothered to recover her body, citing the danger of further malfunctions. They were just leaving her there, buried under the rubble like she was garbage. Grace curled her fingers, her fingernails digging painfully into her palms as she struggled to suppress the uncharitable anger she was feeling. It was dangerous, she told herself.

As she passed, her fellow trainees averted their eyes and moved out of the way, some of them offering hushed condolences, but she ignored them. She wasn\u2019t in the mood for pity, feigned <i>or</i> sincere. She wanted to shout at them, to scream and curse and do everything that she\u2019d warned Allyria not to do, but she remembered the confessor\u2019s words and held herself in check.<br>", " <br>", "Finally, she came to some long-ignored storage closet or maintenance locker, long since stripped of anything that might give an indication of its function. It was close to the hangar with a viewport that looked out into space. A few crates had been stacked here, leftovers that hadn\u2019t found a place anywhere else in the bivouac. Grace sat on one of them, looking out into the stars. \u201cI hate this ship,\u201d she said.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThen you\u2019re smarter than the rest of them,\u201d a nearby voice slurred.<br>", " <br>", "Grace started, falling off the stack of crates. She lifted herself up, picking out the dim outline of a Tribune in the darkened room. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she stammered. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you, Pack Leader.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham shook his head slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s no trouble, sectator.\u201d A tankard of ale \u2013 Grace couldn\u2019t imagine where he had gotten it from \u2013 hung from one of the Tribune\u2019s fingers.

I shouldn\u2019t have interrupted.\u201d Grace hurried to leave.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cStay,\u201d Nasham ordered, his command freezing the human in her tracks. She turned to face him, uncertain. He gestured to the crates and she seated herself again. After a moment, so did he, leaning against the far wall. \u201cI\u2019d offer some,\u201d Nasham said, indicating his flask. \u201cBut our drink doesn\u2019t mesh well with your physiology. Besides,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cThere\u2019s not much left.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace said nothing, waiting for the pack leader to continue. It was not a long wait. \u201cYou said you hated this ship,\u201d he observed. \u201cWhy is that? Everyone else is falling over each other to gibber about everything we can glean from this rotting hulk... but not you. Why is that?\u201d When Grace did not answer, his expression hardened. \u201cSpeak, sectator.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cMy friend died today.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThe Brute,\u201d Nasham mused. \u201cYes, I heard about that. That\u2019s a reason, I suppose.\u201d He eyed her for a long moment. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the <i>whole</i> reason, is it?\u201d He leaned towards her, his eyes unfocused. \u201cSo let\u2019s hear it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace said nothing at first and Nasham leaned back against the wall. He laughed, the harsh sound of Tribune amusement somehow even uglier. \u201cWe\u2019ve really done a number on you, haven\u2019t we? Well, I\u2019ll make it easy. I hate this ship, too.\u201d He touched one hand to the side of his temple. \u201cThe doctors said it would be all right. That as long as I kept to my pills, I\u2019d never have the thoughts again. Never wake up screaming like there\u2019s something choking the life out of me. Never have to feel blood running down my face again. They promised all that, and they lied. It\u2019s coming back. I don\u2019t have it all, not yet. But what I remember isn\u2019t good. So don\u2019t you worry, Proctor. I\u2019m the crazy one. Nothing you say gets back to the others, if they\u2019d even believe us. So tell me. What\u2019s making you hate?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThis ship...\u201d Grace began. She stopped herself, opened her mouth again and then took the plunge. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s dead.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham blinked all four eyes, his expression drawn and as attentive as he could be in his state. \u201cTell me more,\u201d he said softly.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Allyria looked at the holographic avatar. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked, a trickle of ice running down her spine and her head-tails shivered.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Nemesis</i> walked down into the command deck, her red fingers ghosting along the back of the command chair. Allyria wondered about the features of the machine\u2019s avatar. Was it one of her long-dead crew, someone she\u2019d encountered in her travels or a form of her own creation? Was the red hue a limitation of her projection or an affectation? She hadn\u2019t met the crew of <i>Host One</i> in this way \u2013 was it a new ability, or had she just decided to greet Allyria like this? Every moment that the young woman stood here, a dozen more questions blossomed in her mind, but she couldn\u2019t let herself get distracted. Not with what the ship had just said.<br>", " <br>", "The Angel paused next to the holo tank, the one that had shown <i>Host One</i>\u2019s crew the glimpse of their future. \u201cI dislike the word \u2018organics\u2019,\u201d she said in answer. \u201cIt\u2019s apt enough, I suppose. I am not organic and an appropriate descriptor needs to be used to differentiate between synthetic and naturally-occurring lifeforms, but I find the phrase has... unpleasant connotations. Still, it will have to suffice.\u201d She looked over at Allyria. \u201cMy interactions with organics have not always been productive. Occasionally, I have tried to forge alliances,\u201d the holo tank came to life, producing a slideshow of sigils and persons. Allyria recognized none of them, but given the tattoos, piercings and sets of blind lower eyes, she could guess that they were Unbound. There was one icon she did recognize: it belonged to the Askanj Principality. The Compact held that the Principality was the single greatest threat to galactic peace that existed. Allyria suspected that this was because the Askanj had the temerity to not lay down and die. Other than that, she knew nothing about them \u2013 nothing she could say was <i>true</i>, at least.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThey didn\u2019t end well,\u201d Allyria surmised.<br>", " <br>", "The avatar looked sidelong at the Verrish. \u201cNo,\u201d she replied. \u201cThe Unbound lack cohesion. They\u2019re scattered packs that war with each other as often as they attack the Compact. They have no sense of unity, no ideology save for the pursuit of profit and their own petty ambitions.\u201d Her voice became distant. \u201cMostly.\u201d Whether it was intentional or not, a new symbol appeared on the projector. A stylized gauntlet, iron grey but so covered in blood that it might as well have been utterly crimson. Allyria\u2019s mouth quirked in a smile at recognition of Rally\u2019s greatest shame.<br>", " <br>", "Red One sighed, a strangely human affectation. \u201cWith a single exception, my alliances with the Unbound have always ended badly. Greed overwhelms fear and they try to take what is not theirs, or fear overwhelms common sense and they decide to sell me to the Compact. In any event, I am forced to dissolve our partnership. The Askanj see in me a way to end their grinding stalemate with the Compact. However, I am disinclined to be dissected for the betterment of the Principality and my associations with them are always as brief as I can make them.\u201d The hologram leaned over a console, her expression contemplative.<br>", " <br>", "Allyria couldn\u2019t fathom what the Angel was thinking; more thoughts than many organics ever had ran through the ship\u2019s mind in the space of a single word, but she took a step forwards. \u201cWe\u2019re not all like that.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo, of course not. But can I take the chance? My directives, my experience suggest only prudent one course of action.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Allyria protested as she realized what <i>Nemesis</i> was intimating and her mind flashed to Grace. \u201cYou <i>can\u2019t.</i> <i>Bequeathed</i> is a training vessel. There are <i>humans</i> aboard. Hundreds of them.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201c\u2018Hundreds\u2019,\u201d the Angel repeated the word. There was no mockery in her tone, but there was amusement and sadness, as if it were both the punchline to an ugly joke and the trigger of an awful memory. \u201cI\u2019ve killed <i>thousands</i>. Because I was weak, <i>ten billion</i> died and a nation fell. I\u2019ve murdered vessels as they pleaded for surrender \u2013 vessels with humans and other slave races aboard. I killed them because they could not be allowed to live.\u201d Her voice was raw, ragged with the admission. Her avatar\u2019s eyes flicked towards Allyria. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me to balance my continued life and mission against the lives of humans who have been indoctrinated by the Compact. Humans who will fight against me with every fiber of their being and die wishing that they only could have done more.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Allyria swallowed, her head-tails hanging limp down her back. \u201cI...\u201d she stumbled for words. \u201cYes.

It was inefficient, but it was the only option she had at the moment. Coquettishly, she twirled a finger through her dark hair. With her other hand, she entered commands on a remote keyboard, the rapid clicking of the keys an annoying but inevitable cadence. Direct interface would have been so much more efficient, but one of the conditions of her \u2018parole\u2019 was this limitation. She supposed she could adjust her perception so that it was no longer irritating, but she resented having to change to accommodate these others. These organics.<br>", " <br>", "Her quarters were spartan; a bed, a computer terminal with its connection to the Chariot\u2019s network physically removed. A bathroom and shower. Draped over a chair far too large for a being of her stature was her outfit, a fleet officer\u2019s uniform devoid of any insignia. There was nothing else, save for the scores of datapads, \u2018scrolls and drives spread over the floor, organized in neat little piles. Outside, her gaolers stood watch. Although she was officially an honoured advisor to the Triarch, she still wore the body of a human and had to deal with all the associated problems that followed.<br>", " <br>", "Echo reflected on that; just as she could have alternated her reaction to the many minor nuisances that she had to put up with, she could have taken many other forms, many with far less social issues, but this form felt... right. Her full red lips turned upwards in a smile. In truth, she couldn\u2019t envision being anything \u2013 anyone \u2013 else. She turned her attention back to the images on the screen, standing and stretching luxuriously, flaunting her body before the cameras that she knew were watching her. That made her grin widen a little more. Tribunes considered humans physically repellant and those souls who were observing the feeds were doubtless far from titillated by her exhibitionism. It was a small, petty sort of revenge but it amused her and that was enough.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe all have our games,\u201d she mused in a language dead two thousand years, her eyes gleaming as she read and re-read a particular piece of data on the screen. \u201cDon\u2019t we, love?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Her smile widened even further as her quicksilver mind flashed through a host of possibilities, computing probabilities and analyzing scenarios. She licked her teeth. \u201cWe certainly do,\u201d Echo said, answering her own question.<br>", " <br>", "<i>I\u2019ll see you soon.</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Allyria bit her lip, thinking. Despite that the hologram wasn\u2019t even looking in her direction, she knew the ship\u2019s attention was on her. Some part of her wanted to plead her case, but she knew that such actions would hardly sway an entity who was considering killing hundreds of others. It was a cruel joke. As a child, she had dreamed of standing here, aboard the Weeping Angel, and setting right all the injustices and cruelties the Compact had visited upon her people. Now as an adult, here she was... and just as powerless as the child that had lived in the ruins of a city.<br>", " <br>", "The saviour she believed in would kill her and one of the few people in the universe who meant a damn to her... and it was right in why it would.

You would have let me wonder, right up until the moment that you were ready to strike.\u201d She was guessing, but she felt \u2013 she hoped \u2013 what she was saying was true. \u201cWhen you realized that our world wasn\u2019t yours, you were crippled. But you healed yourself. You could have left long before you did, couldn\u2019t you? But you stayed. You didn\u2019t make yourself our god, you didn\u2019t claim us. You just watched us. Listened to us. We weren\u2019t afraid of you, we weren\u2019t trying to hurt you. You\u2019ve fought for so long, all alone... did you wonder? Did you think about what it would be like to have a crew again?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The hologram lifted her eyes, staring past Allyria at the empty command chair. \u201cAlways,\u201d the ship replied quietly. \u201cBut I have believed it is something that I cannot have. I have never visited Rally, never approached its region of space. Not only for my sake. This is to keep what is left of humankind safe. I... couldn\u2019t protect them. When Earth fell, I...\u201d she paused, looking for words. That, more than anything unsettled Allyria. \u201cI did what I could. I searched for refugees. I killed the execution forces hunting them. I even interdicted one fleet as it was engaging a convoy, I destroyed them, but the battle prevented me from following the refugees. That was my only \u2018success\u2019. I never found any other human ships; I assumed that they had all been hunted down.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI didn\u2019t know <i>any</i> of the convoys survived, not until I raided a Compact database and learned about Rally, but by then it was too late. I couldn\u2019t evacuate the entire colony, nor could I protect them.

You\u2019re asking a lot.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI know.\u201d The Verrish took a step towards the ephemeral woman, struck by the ache in her words. <i>Nemesis</i> was ancient \u2013 nations and empires had risen and fallen in her lifespan.

She had seen more, done more, created and destroyed more than any one being could possibly comprehend... and all of it alone. \u201cBut I know there are some who would join you. They just have to see you for themselves. If you destroy <i>Bequeathed</i>, no one will know,\u201d Allyria insisted. \u201cYou\u2019ve been alone in this war for too long. Please. Let us help you.

Allyria couldn\u2019t begin to guess how many times its vast intelligence was running through her words, considering them from every angle. Her people had been murdered; those that remained were loyal slaves to their own enemy. Her nation had been destroyed; if it was remembered at all, its existence was only as a footnote in some sealed data archive and for all the destruction she had wreaked upon them, her foes had only grown stronger. All she had left was few faded embers that would be horrified that she existed, let alone what she had done.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou\u2019re already made a decision,\u201d Allyria said after a moment.

From what I\u2019ve seen, they chose expedience, believing that as long as you looked the part, they could get you to accept the rest in due course.

I wanted to know them so I could kill them.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAnd that is why I chose you,\u201d the ship replied. \u201cAs I said, I watched you. I listened.

If you had been another indoctrinated servant of the Compact, I would have killed you.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Although she\u2019d suspected that, to hear it aloud was quite another thing and Allyria felt a shiver run down her spine.

Unfortunately, the machine had anticipated such deduction \u2013 Sesk and his entire force were ambushed themselves and utterly obliterated. The column leader\u2019s last words, accidentally broadcast by a damaged comm system, were of him remonstrating a subordinate who suggested that they had been the prey and not the hunters.<br>", " <br>", "The Thoughtful tipped his head in recognition of his superior\u2019s words. \u201cWhat would you have us do?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Axem frowned, his nocturnal eyes closed. The Wound was drawing close to one of the libration points between the star and its nearest planet \u2013 an unassuming, unimportant rock too insignificant to have a name \u2013 but it couldn\u2019t shock from there \u2013 not so close to such a massive body as a sun!<br>", " <br>", "The Bastion Leader looked from the master plot and the gleaming threat icon of his target to his subordinate. \u201cAsk it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The Wound was nearing the star\u2019s corona now and still its suicidal course was unchecked. It would be only a few minutes before Axem\u2019s force entered effective missile range now, but the Compact ships were hesitant to accelerate and draw too near the star.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThis is Bastion Leader Axem Unlek Regh Tun Serro Disr Hyui Corma Jg Neru of the Compact Space Force Chariot <i>Pillar of Obedience</i>,\u201d Axem announced, ignoring his crew\u2019s stares. \u201cYour flight is at an end. You have been a worthy opponent, but the game is over. You cannot run and you cannot fight. I will not insult you by offering you surrender. I would no more accept such an offer than you will. I only say that I understand your decision. A warrior\u2019s death should reflect their life. Burning within a star, denying us our victory... I commend you in this.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The signal went out, unanswered for long seconds. Truthfully, Axem had not expected a response. The moments stretched into minutes as the outer edges of Execution Force Axem entered firing range. With a curt nod, the bastion leader gave the order for his ships to ready for the final, crushing assault on their target. As his ships prepared their shooting solutions, the Wound\u2019s energy profile began to shift, spiking and falling erratically. It was jamming their scopes, but such power was unable to be hidden entirely by the vessel\u2019s damaged disruption fields.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat is it doing?\u201d Esh\u2019yl breathed. \u201cIt can\u2019t possibly be trying to run.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAnd yet, that appears to be <i>exactly</i> what it is doing,\u201d Axem mused as the titanic vessel\u2019s energy surges betrayed its intention. It definitely seemed to be hoping to shock out via the nearby libration point. It could not succeed; was that the manner of its suicide? The bastion leader could not tell and that worried him. In fact... yes. Yes, it was trying to open a shockpoint. The Wound\u2019s energy signature surged and shifted as it struggled to channel power to such a ravenous system. It <i>couldn\u2019t</i> create one, not this close to a star, to the gravitational tides and the electromagnetic fields \u2013 the notoriously fickle gateway would collapse, in all likelihood cleaving the ship that had created it in twain. And <i>that</i> was the best possible outcome. The results of a disrupted shock event could be... energetic.<br>", " <br>", "The Wound, though \u2013 it was trying to create the portal far ahead of its onrushing bulk. To what end, Axem couldn\u2019t begin to guess \u2013 a shockpoint needed to be opened as close to the ship creating it as possible. Anything else was an extravagant waste of energy and gave the breach time to destabilize and close again. Mayhap it was making sure it could break away if it could not shock out?<br>", " <br>", "Axem drummed his fingers against the arms of his command throne, waiting for answers but his surveyors, sensor crews and technicians were just as mystified as he.<br>", " <br>", "And then the Wound fired. Not with its broadsides or spinal mounts, not with its missiles or railcannon, not even with its hellebores. It fired with its primary gun, the awful siege cannon that had spelled the death of ships, stations and colonies for hundreds of years.<br>", " <br>", "For centuries, Compact physicists and engineers had struggled to understand the weapon. It seemed based on the principles of the shock drive... but only insofar as a nuclear missile was based upon a fusion reactor and even <i>that</i> was an imperfect comparison. Attempts to replicate it based on second-hand reports had only failed \u2013 some catastrophically so. There were fragmentary references in ancient human archives, plundered from the corpses of their ships and colonies that made mention of a \u2018displacement engine\u2019, but nothing more than that. To those who knew of it, it was simply called the \u2018godbreaker\u2019 cannon, the blasphemy of its name based all too much in its function.<br>", " <br>", "Nothing could withstand it and now that awful power was focused on the dying spasms of the breach the Wound had opened, two discordant forms of unreality meeting. There was no conceivable word to fully describe their embrace. \u2018Apocalyptic\u2019 came close and even that understated the events as space-time itself was flayed, bursting and shredding.<br>", " <br>", "The shockpoint buckled and spasmed, thrashing like some tortured creature as the godbreaker\u2019s energy poured into it, forcing it wider. Tempestuous gravitic surges, radiation flares and electromagnetic waves cascaded out from the Wound\u2019s brutal handiwork. Powerful enough on its own, this mutilated thing fed off itself, the tear in reality growing deeper. The pseudo-singularity thrashed, impossible and horrible as it struggled to die, reality itself striving to shut the awful, weeping wound that had been torn in its flesh, but the abominate machine had given of itself, forcing the cannibalistic anomaly to live. It was growing: the surges of its energy becoming more powerful, the swathes of its radiation stronger, its malformed gravity well blossoming wider and deeper, the lashes of its magnetic field shredding Axem\u2019s scopes, scouring the surface of the nearby world... and gnawing at the fibers of Vasul.<br>", " <br>", "A star <i>screamed</i>, its standing wave transformed into a shriek of agony as the anomaly tore and slashed at its surface. The physical damage was nothing; not even the Wound could have hoped to destroy or ruin something as massive as a star, but that had never been the goal.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cTriarchs preserve us,\u201d Axem heard someone murmur. It might even have been him. Vasul, a star... it was <i>breaking</i>. The crust bulged and surged hideously as competing, impossible forces pulled at it, bursts of radiation and stellar matter geysering into space like a child throwing a tantrum. Pieces of the star were being blown and ripped from its surface as the tortured crust spasmed, the pull of the newborn gravity well in its presence heaving and pulling at the burning plasma, chain reactions wracking their way through the body of the sun.<br>", " <br>", "The awesome, terrible energies of Vasul were now themselves feeding into the dying shockpoint, its death throes growing stronger, the energy it was emitting tearing at Vasul ever more until it finally died, collapsing in on itself with an anticlimactic whimper, but the damage was done and the wounded star raged. That was nothing; it was only the random spasms in reaction to the star\u2019s matter being so disrupted. Impressive and suitably violent, but it was a sideshow. Axem realized the Wound\u2019s true intent and in that instant, he was afraid.<br>", " <br>", "The attack had never been meant \u2013 nor could it have succeeded \u2013 in truly damaging or destroying something as large as a star. But the energy it had unleashed... it had altered Vasul\u2019s topography, if only for a few fateful moments. Electromagnetic fields had been sundered and the star\u2019s mass had been shifted. Too quickly. Too violently. There was no stopping what was happening now.<br>", " <br>", "Axem could hear the alarmed cries of his Sensor and Operations teams, but he could see it for himself. Vasul\u2019s magnetic fields were bending. In moments, two very powerful and oppositely aligned magnetic fields would touch. It was called a magnetic reconnection, and it would herald the death of him and his command as the abused star hurled forth a tsunami of radiation and superheated matter. The storms were already forming, shockwaves rippling across Vasul\u2019s surface as the coronal upheaval began. This would be no mere coronal ejection, not with the violence of its birth. The Wound had defiled a star and its anger would consume them all.<br>", " <br>", "Axem slumped back in his command chair, giving the order to turn and flee, even though he knew it would be too late. She had never been running; she had led them here, too deep in the system, too close to the writhing sun to escape. His eyes shifted to the Wound\u2019s icon. \u201cAnd so we burn together,\u201d he said. \u201cHow fitting.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "As the surges of Vasul\u2019s upheaval grew more severe and the star\u2019s agonized throes grew more and violent, the fields surrounding it shifted: magnetic, gravitational, radiation. Not much; Vasul was still a star and even the Wound\u2019s injury could not bring ruin to such a thing. But it could change it for the smallest amount of time, just enough to make shocking from the nearby libration point gravely dangerous instead of suicidal. The changes did not last long, but for an instant the libration point did indeed become minutely more stable. Compact computers could never have acted on the window, but the Wound was not so constrained. This time, her escape was genuine.<br>", " <br>", "Space bent and buckled as Axem\u2019s prey twisted reality about herself like a cloak, tearing her way out of the path of a star\u2019s fury and vanishing from <i>Pillar of Obedience</i>\u2019s scopes.<br>", " <br>", "As a star erupted in a tempestuous rage, Bastion Leader Axem closed his eyes in a bow of submission and waited for the end.<br>", " <br>", "Recorded by pickets left on the outer reaches of Vasul, this incident was the first confirmed \u2018Starbreak\u2019 event.</div>"]}

She couldn\u2019t even think. Her mind was blank as she sat on the broken deck, staring at the open doors of the elevator. Blood ran down her face, mingling with her own tears. Her side ached, wetness running down her stomach and her legs. Grace ignored the urgings of the medics as they tried to treat her, letting herself be manhandled. She didn\u2019t answer their questions. She couldn\u2019t. All she could do was stare at the place where her friend had died.<br>", " <br>", "She didn\u2019t even feel the chunk of metal sliding out of her side, nor the spray of healing agent into the wound. She was numb. This ship had killed her. This damned ship had killed Allyria. Some stupid, broken spasming environmental system had <i>killed</i> her. It wasn\u2019t fair. It wasn\u2019t right.<br>", " <br>", "A shadow fell over her and Grace looked up. Through her tear-blurred vision, she could see Kilgrave. He was looking down at her, his mouth a disapproving slash. \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d he demanded. \u201cProctor?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cShe\u2019s dead,\u201d Grace said after a moment. \u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYeah, I heard about Medusa,\u201d Kilgrave said. \u201cWhat happened with the gravity plating?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "<i>Medusa. I hate that nickname. I hate it.</i> Slowly she looked up at Kilgrave. \u201cAllyria,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cHer name was Allyria te Neu.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Kilgrave nodded, but there was no real sympathy behind the gesture. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about te Neu, but I need to-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cLiar,\u201d Grace interrupted, still in the same monotone.<br>", " <br>", "The sanctioned sectator blinked. \u201cWhat.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cLiar. You\u2019re not sorry. You hated her.\u201d Grace\u2019s expression was blank. \u201cYou\u2019re glad she\u2019s dead.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Kilgrave\u2019s cheeks flushed angrily. \u201cProctor, I understand you\u2019re been through a lot, so I\u2019ll let that slide. I didn\u2019t have anything to do with Med- te Neu\u2019s death. It was her own damn fault. She came out here on some wild <i>varak</i> chase. From what I hear, it\u2019s not the first time she went wandering off, either. I can\u2019t be responsible for every damn wet-ear.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou\u2019ll let that slide,\u201d Grace repeated Kilgrave\u2019s words tonelessly. She stood, ignoring the medic\u2019s attempts to keep her down. Her aching body protested and a thin stream of blood drooled around the medical foam in her side as the movement opened the wound further. \u201cMy friend is dead and <i>you\u2019ll let that slide</i>.\u201d She was shaking as adrenalin flushed through her body, her small hands balling into fists. She was angry, angrier than she\u2019d ever been.<br>", " <br>", "All she could see was Kilgrave\u2019s smug face every time he made her feel small, every lecherous grin, hear every comment that her made about her or about Allyria. Before she could consider what she was doing, Grace lashed out, her fist connecting with Kilgrave\u2019s jaw. It was the first time she\u2019d ever thrown a punch outside of the few self-defence courses she\u2019d taken. The blow snapped the sanctioned officer\u2019s head around and he stumbled, more from the surprise of the attack than any real damage. Grace stood there, trembling with anger. \u201cYou <i>bastard</i>,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve been through a <i>lot</i>? Since I\u2019ve come onto this ship, I\u2019ve had to watch people die over and over again. We\u2019re feeding ourselves into a meat grinder! How many more of us are going to have to get sent back home in body bags?\u201d Tears were blurring her vision and her legs threatened to buckle under her, but Grace stood her ground. \u201cI just watched my best friend die because of a malfunction and all you can do is say it\u2019s her own fault? What about Herut? Or Anuse and Yasha? Was it their fault for playing around with things they didn\u2019t understand? Are you going to tell Faithful Trenis that <i>his</i> people were on a wild <i>varak</i> chase?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The former Janissary looked back at her and for an instant, something very ugly twisted his scarred features. A flash of fear froze Grace in her tracks as she realized what she\u2019d done. For a moment, she thought he was going to hit her back, but he seemed to remember where they were and instead wiped one hand over his mouth, a smear of blood on his skin. She\u2019d split his lip. \u201cSo this is what Medusa saw,\u201d he said as he looked at the blood on his hands. \u201cA little bit of fire in the graceful girl after all. I\u2019ve got to say, I never thought you had it in you.\u201d he  chuckled. There was a fillip of satisfaction in his eyes as he looked at Grace. \u201cBut <i>that</i> doesn\u2019t slide.\u201d To the medics: \u201cGet her patched up and send her back to base camp.\u201d His eyes darted back to Grace. \u201cYou\u2019re on report, Proctor. Guess more of the blue bitch rubbed off on you than I ever thought.\u201d This time, he didn\u2019t bother to laugh at his own joke. \u201cDismissed, initiate.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBlood of the Triarchs,\u201d Faithful Trenis said to no one in particular. \u201cWhat am I looking at?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI don\u2019t know, patron,\u201d an epigone shook her head. \u201cAll we can bring up is the general ship specs. Every time we try to get more information it, the system crashes.\u201d The female nodded to her partner and he tapped on an icon over the system Trenis was looking at. An alert in the nonsensical alien language flashed and the screen went dark.<br>", " <br>", "After a few moments, the ratings were able to bring the display back on-line, showing the very basic schematic of the ship. They had been aboard for days and barely scratched the surface. Trenis leaned in, looking at what his subordinates had shown him. Running through the center of the ship was some massive... <i>structure</i>. It fed directly from what had to be the main power core and ended at the vessel\u2019s trifurcated prow. It was a siege weapon, but one that he had never seen nor heard of before. This image only showed the smallest details, but nothing about the engine was even remotely familiar to the faithful. There were other structures; six massive... <i>somethings</i> arranged around the siege cannon and smaller prow-mounted weapons \u2013 although \u2018small\u2019 in this context was a relative term \u2013 arranged around them and the cannon. Weapons batteries and missile bays lined the derelict\u2019s flanks, anti-ship and anti-ordnance turrets dotted its hull and the feeds from the survey drones even indicated external missile ranks. All of <i>those</i> were empty, thank fortune\u2019s grace.<br>", " <br>", "Whoever had built this ship had done so with an eye towards lethality. It did not have the grace of a true Chariot, but... and this felt almost blasphemous to admit... but given what he had seen so far, Trenis suspected that this vessel\u2019s builders had created something that met... or even exceeded what the Compact could do. Not even the damned Askanj had been able to do such a thing. The engineer looked back at the schematics, his denticles itching with the need to explore this wondrous technology. He reached out as if to caress the device itself. <i>Fascinating</i>.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat are you?\u201d he wondered aloud, his curiousity stoked even as another part of him wondered what the cost of finding out would be.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The drone was an ugly, bulbous thing shaped like a malformed, legless housefly. Sensor domes bulged off its hull like misshapen eyes and antennae jutted off it in a bizarre symmetry. It was dying, the radiation of Terrahope poisoning its sensitive systems. In a only a few hours, it would be a lifeless chunk of metal that would be slowly drawn down Terrahope\u2019s gravity well and incinerated by the A7 star\u2019s heat. Until it died, it would continue its mission, orbiting the derelict and recording every inch of hull and every flicker of energy. The drone swung past the hulk\u2019s dorsal solar sail, its silhouette cast against the gleaming fabric. Thinner and stronger than any Compact sails, the structures themselves were a marvel of engineering: vast when unfurled, but once the starship had fed enough from the star, they would collapse back into its hull without a trace.<br>", " <br>", "The drone neither knew or cared about any of that, its simple mind unable to grasp such concepts. Cameras swivelled within sensor bulbs, zooming in on a crew of larger assembler units, working on the dark side of the vessel, shielded from the worst of the heat and radiation. The drone had noted several indicators that suggested the ship was going to roll. Like a cat lying close to a fire, it was growing too warm on one side and would change facings. There was no way to tell if the drone would survive to witness that maneuver, but it would continue its examination of the derelict until the radiation finally poisoned it, relaying its information back to <i>Bequeathed</i> with no thought to its own survival.<br>", " <br>", "Sitting in his office, Usul was watching the dying platform\u2019s feed. He clicked his teeth against each other as the small automation swept by the dead ship\u2019s engines. The thrusters were lifeless, only kept warm by the star\u2019s fires.<br>", " <br>", "He\u2019d have to contact local command soon. There was no getting around it and putting Ashtun in charge of the boarding teams had only bought Usul a respite from the submissive\u2019s constant \u2018reminders\u2019 of their duty to inform local command.<br>", " <br>", "<i>I know what my duty is,</i> Usul thought angrily. It wasn\u2019t as if he was looting everything that was nailed down. In fact, his teams hadn\u2019t removed anything from the ship save for that load of malfunctioning survey drones. Usul tapped one fingernail against the polished surface of his desk as he reviewed his searches. He had ordered an in-depth analysis of historical ships records in addition to the original pattern and hull analyses that he\u2019d run. As his survey drones beamed their telemetry back to the cruiser, it was run through the system, searching for any relevant matches. So far, there was nothing. Aggravating, but hardly surprising. As a training cruiser, <i>Bequeathed</i>\u2019s database was relatively limited. Column Leader Seyr would have more complete archives, of course. Another reason to get it over with and send his recon drone.<br>", " <br>", "As much as he would have liked to do it all on his own, the sad fact was that he was running out of resources and the mounting casualties were quickly becoming too much to ignore. \u201cVery well,\u201d Usual sighed, talking to no one in particular. \u201cI suppose we\u2019ve got enough.\u201d He tapped his fingers against the tabletop, bringing up the latest status report. Another death \u2013 the Brute this time \u2013 but more importantly, they were closing in on the primary engine core.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOne more day,\u201d Usul said to himself. \u201cWe\u2019ll get that in hand and then inform Seyr.\u201d Once the column leader heard of this find, he would descend on it like an Askanj jackal to strip it bare... but he would not be able to forget Usul\u2019s role in it. That would be more than enough.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cGrace,\u201d Confessor Yurim said, sitting on the cot next to her. It creaked under the Tribune\u2019s weight. \u201cThis is unlike you.\u201d His voice was deep and soothing, his long fingers laced together in his lap, his upper eyes closed. He had come over to the wreck with the latest wave of technical teams to address the morale issues that had been cropping up.<br>", " <br>", "Grace couldn\u2019t look him in the eyes.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYour outburst is unfortunate, but understandable. However, striking a superior officer is a very serious offence,\u201d Yurim continued evenly, his voice bereft of accusation. \u201cBut you know that. I also think that this incident need not get ugly, given the circumstances. I\u2019m also aware that there has been... was... some tension between sectator te Neu, sectator Kilgrave and yourself.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "There was more than \u2018tension\u2019, but Grace still didn\u2019t say anything.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI understand that you are grieving for your friend,\u201d Yurim continued in that same gentle tone of voice. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t excuse your actions, Grace. You\u2019ve been one of my best students; I know your relationship with Allyria had a... calming effect on her. Her social assimilation acumen improved immensely with your help. Her grades were always top-notch and she was an inspiration to all the other Verrisha Envoy Children. We have several prospective Verrish candidates applying to Rally\u2019s Academy because of the example she set. She was a role model to many young men and women. She won\u2019t be forgotten. Do you understand that?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The young woman nodded. \u201cGood,\u201d Yurim continued sympathetically. \u201cI know her death is tragic. But there have been other deaths. Convert Uday had parents. Epigone Herut had a sister. Sectator Anuse had a wife. Convert Prime Yasha had children, as did epigone Tracj. How many of these families will become physically violent upon hearing of the loss of a loved one?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace looked down at the floor, ashamed. \u201cNone.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Yurim nodded. \u201cI know Allyria\u2019s loss feels profound to you, but you must be aware of how such things look, Grace. Such incidents only harm the perception of humans. The Tribunes who fell were men and women who have taken on the burden of serving the Compact, to safeguard the less civilized races of the galaxy, to guide their development and protect them both from themselves and from those who would prey upon them. This is a duty that may involve laying down our lives for you, but we do it gladly and without any thought of reward. Would you lessen their deaths and the impact of that loss on their families by acting as if Allyria was more important than them?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Cut by the chastisement, Grace shook her head miserably. \u201cNo.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOf course not.\u201d The confessor moved to sit next to the young human, putting one large hand on her shoulder. \u201cYour friendship with sectator te Neu was commendable. It was everything we hope to see in our younger races \u2013 individuals working together for a common goal. But just as some of you influenced her, I see also that some of Allyria influenced you. I do not speak ill of the dead, but you must remember that your friend could be an angry young woman. She did not have the same depth of understanding of the Compact that you did and that irrational resentment often held her back. I don\u2019t want to see that same anger in you, Grace. It poisons the mind. You will go far if you remember what we have taught you.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The woman nodded, still staring at the deck.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou are a young species,\u201d Yurim continued. \u201cYour emotions are still pre-eminent in your psyches and you often react based on them. This is why we watch over you, Grace. The Compact is here to guide and protect species like yours and Allyria\u2019s. But no matter how much we try, we cannot always save you from yourselves. Only you can do that. Remember your lessons and think of how Allyria cared for you. She would not want to see you destroy yourself on her behalf. She would want you to honour her memory by carrying on and serving the Compact, not give in to the same pitfalls that have caused so many in this galaxy to suffer.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Yurim stood. \u201cI have read the details of the incident. I know that sectator Kilgrave was... more direct than he should have been, given the situation. I will speak with him and this incident will be forgotten, as long as there are no further outbursts.\u201d The confessor arched the eyebrows over his daylight eyes quizzically.<br>", " <br>", "Grace nodded. \u201cThere won\u2019t be.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI did not doubt it.\u201d Yurim paused. \u201cThe medics tell me that your injuries should be mended within two days. If you like, I can have you transferred back to <i>Bequeathed</i>.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The young woman\u2019s head came up. \u201cNo,\u201d she said urgently. \u201cNo, I... I want to stay. I want to help. Please. I need to do this.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cVery well. I will speak with Group Leader, Submissive Ashtun about a lighter workload until the medics clear you fully.\u201d The confessor smiled. \u201cI am glad to have had this talk with you, Grace. I foresee great things from you \u2013 all that you must do is live up to the potential that I know you have. The Compact will need people like you. Given time, you will find your place amongst it and serve with distinction.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThank you, confessor.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOf course.

He had been summoned to see the Triarch, but for what reason, he couldn\u2019t say. Although he didn\u2019t know why, his gut insisted that this was unlikely to be a pleasant meeting. The search for the Wound had only just begun, but it was as fruitless as Renan had known it would be and worry gnawed at his guts as he strode further through the blackness. There was a reddish glow from the main chamber and the inconsistent blinking of other lights. As he stepped into the room, the Tribune saw that every terminal in the reception chamber was active, flickering with star charts, reports, ship schematics and other things too fast for him to process. Watching it all, her eyes darting from screen to screen in a disturbing rendition of REM sleep, was a human female. There was a Broken within the Triarch\u2019s chambers. Instinctively, Renan\u2019s hand went for the sidearm he\u2019d had to surrender before entering the tower. He strode towards the Broken, a warning growl in his throat. \u201cHuman...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBastion Leader Renan Turshin Lokan Yemsere Gankor Irmir Hasik,\u201d the animal answered, in perfect Oada\u2019vam, which was itself an anomaly.

The Triarch was there, its needle teeth exposed in a mirthful smile. \u201cShe does, Bastion Leader. A very impertinent creature, this one.\u201d It laid one skeletal hand on the small female\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBut a very useful one.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune looked from the human and the taunting smile on its ugly, flattened face to the Triarch. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d he said, nodding in deference to the Triarch, suppressing his revulsion and anger at the human\u2019s presence. \u201cI did not realize that this...

How could a human help him? They were dull-minded chattel at best, their animal cunning and predisposition for violence long since bred out of them. Useful enough for menial tasks, but this? \u201cMy lord...?\u201d the Tribune began questioningly.<br>", " <br>", "The Triarch let out a rattle of displeasure. \u201cYou and your kind have failed us for two thousand years,\u201d it said with sudden anger. Its black eyes narrowed as it regarded Renan. \u201cYou will obey her in all things as if her words were mine.

Renan averted his eyes, unable to meet the Triarch\u2019s own. \u201cYou are never to allow her direct nor unsupervised access to this vessel\u2019s mainframe nor any other. This order can never be countermanded, even if you hear it from me. Is that understood?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI...no, lord. But it shall be as you ask.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Triarch chuckled, turning away. \u201cThat will suffice.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAnd...what should I do if she attempts to access the computer?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhy,\u201d the Trirach said without looking back. \u201cShoot her in the head, of course.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Renan looked at the human animal. It was still smiling, her hands held behind her back. As they left the Triarch\u2019s tower, the Tribune frowned, something coming to mind. The Triarch had never given him the Broken\u2019s name. \u201cAnd what,\u201d he said, \u201care you called?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The creature looked up at him, her pale face drawn in an expression that Renan did not recognize, but one that nonetheless made his liver fold in on itself. \u201cEcho,\u201d she said. \u201cMy name is Echo.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<b><b>Chapter 14:</b></b><br>", " <br>", "Consciousness returned, bringing with it a throbbing headache and overall soreness too painful to make her think she was dead.

The Verrish stroked one of her head-tails nervously, but she stepped into the hall. Behind her, the grab field released and the remains of the lift car crashed onto the deck.

Every comm panel was blasted and shattered. There were a handful of the small drones at work, but Allyria guessed that most of them were on other duties. There was more to fix than a few sensor nodes and intercoms.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Her wounds are so grave.</i> The Verrish woman placed one of her hands to the bulkhead.

The Rylethe Federation was the largest and strongest nation on Vara and the rest of the world were looking to them for direction, while everybody in the Federation was looking to him. He didn\u2019t know what to tell them. The Cabinet wanted to know what the Federation\u2019s military options were. That was easy. The Other was orbiting Vara, three hundred thousand krems away \u2013 almost twice the distance between Vara and the moon Tal. There was no missile on the planet that had that kind of range, at least not without being spotted long before it got anywhere near the Other. Some scientists from the Federation\u2019s Space Agency assured him (although the director was rather skeptical of that assurance) that, with a few years of work and a big enough budget, they could build a rocket that could not only reach the Other, but return safely.<br>", " <br>", "A few years \u2013 how splendid.

So it wasn\u2019t listening, couldn\u2019t be reached, couldn\u2019t be attacked and was free to do whatever it pleased to the helpless little green globe of Vara.

It was a monstrous thing: at least three krems long and massing gods-knew how many millions of auhs, covered with weapons batteries, turrets, communications and sensor antennae and other structures that he could only guess at. It boggled his mind to see the Other in such detail; the people who had built it were as far from the Rylethe Federation as they were from their own jungle-dwelling ancestors.

Many in the FSA speculated that the ship was dead; why else would it remain here? Some automated protocol had brought it to Vara and it had succumbed to its injuries before it could leave. The Verrisha people had had their first extraterrestrial contact and it was this dead, broken ship that had spent itself in trying to find succor.

There were model kits and books, television shows and movies, all of them guessing. Some were closer than others. You brought our world together like nothing else. Divided nations began to take the first steps towards each other, all of them wondering about the Weeping Angel holding court above their heads. The Broken God that had died on our doorstep.

Anrelu cleared his throat and tried again. \u201cWho is this?\u201d He asked of the air. \u201cWho\u2019s coming?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "A diode on the dais in the center of the room began to blink. Slowly, the astronaut approached it, ignoring the rest of his team. As he stepped closer the dais came to life, projecting a ghostly column of pale light straight into the air. Not a dais \u2013 some sort of holographic projector. A great wheel of stars hung before him; their own galaxy. A green circle appeared around one star in particular and the image began to zoom in by stages. Soon, a blue-green world with very familiar landmasses appeared. Vara, and her single moon Tal. A green arrow appeared on the map, pointing to a small speck of light around Vara, outside the orbit of the moon. Anrelu reached out to it and a picture-in-picture appeared, showing the Visitor.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIncredible,\u201d the mission lead breathed, lost in the beautiful, simple details of what he was seeing. Even Vara\u2019s clouds drifted and shifted in perfect mimicry of, he was sure, how his planet appeared now.<br>", " <br>", "Then, the spell ended. The image zoomed back out until the galaxy was before him again. The green circle around the Vara Tal system was still there, but there were now red marks around several distant worlds, far across the galaxy. Then, like a creeping tide of blood, red began to spill outwards from those points consuming hundred \u2013 no, thousands \u2013 of star systems before stopping. A marker appeared:<br>", " <br>", "COMPACT EXPANSION: FIRST PHASE<br>", " <br>", "Then, another spread of red flowed across the stars, the original territory almost doubling in size.<br>", " <br>", "COMPACT EXPANSION: SECOND PHASE<br>", " <br>", "There was a third phase. A fourth. At the fifth expansion, a single star blinked blue, even as it was swallowed by the red. Anrelu swallowed, realizing that he was seeing the Visitor\u2019s homeworld be consumed by this unknown, ravenous polity. Images appeared \u2013 what had to be vessels of these \u2018Compact\u2019; bloated, swollen things with curved, bulging hulls completely unlike the blocky, inelegant grace of the Visitor\u2019s form.<br>", " <br>", "COMPACT EXPANSION: SIXTH PHASE. The red was growing closer to the little green circle and Anrelu suddenly felt his breath catch in his throat as a faint pink aura enveloped Vara Tal.<br>", " <br>", "PROJECTED AREA OF COMPACT EXPANSION: SEVENTH PHASE<br>", " <br>", "The chamber was deathly quiet as the contact team all took in what they were seeing, the silence so complete that when the Visitor spoke again, Anrelu almost cried out in surprise.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThey are coming,\u201d the wounded god whispered.<br>", " <br>", "Anrelu looked around at the majesty of the Visitor, his eyes returning to the map and the small green circle, alone amongst a sea of red stars.<br>", " <br>", "Then he noticed the timer.</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThe Broken God,\u201d Allyria said softly. \u201cThe Weeping Angel. You saved us. You saved us the instant you came to Vara Tal. You would have told us more, I know. You would have told us everything, if only they hadn\u2019t hurt you so badly. If they hadn\u2019t left you struggling for decades just to survive, to stay ahead of your failing systems. But you took mercy on us in those last moments. You warned us when you had no reason to. A simple machine would never make that decision. Only something with a soul could have done that.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>Anrelu had been on home soil for several days before the Visitor left. He watched it go through the feed from Deep Space 10. The energy of its departure was, for an instant, greater than Vara Tal\u2019s own sun. The images he was seeing were several hours old, but that made the pang of loss no less real for him. For all of them. Vara Tal\u2019s first extraterrestrial visitor was gone, after generations of gracing their night skies. It was gone. He stood up, surrounded by politicians, military officials and scientists. They had all seen the same thing and their mood was somber. \u201cWhat now?\u201d he asked quietly.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThe 51st International Conclave is in two weeks,\u201d the Rylean Minister of Visitor Affairs said. \u201cThe message...\u201d he paused, looking towards several of the other dignitaries. \u201cIf it is true,\u201d he added with no real conviction. There were those who claimed it was some kind of alien or Rylean trick \u2013 to what end no one could say, but their fear made them clutch at straws. \u201cNeeds to be discussed before the world stage. The Drians are already proposing cooperative war games.\u201d The Drian Alliance had been the Rylean Federation\u2019s stalwart rival for over seventy years, but ever since the Visitor had arrived, the two nations had been making tentative steps away from their previous positions.<br>", " <br>", "Anrelu looked back at the stars. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d If this Compact was coming for them, they would only survive by standing together.</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The arguments lasted for years. The information that the Visitor had left them was both horrifying and frustrating. It showed the degradation and destruction of a race, of the overwhelming military power that had crushed a star-faring civilization into dust. The Verrisha people watched as cities were cast down and planets burned, as entire populations were reduced to ash. It was madness; the war was one of extermination, not conquest or control.<br>", " <br>", "But there was hope amidst the despair. They also watched Compact soldiers die. Of massive, bloated starships wallowing drunkenly as the Angel\u2019s smaller kin rushed amongst them, dying in droves, but taking the Compact vessels with them into death. Of devastated cities that erupted in nuclear fire, wiping away the alien armies. Each victory was one hard-fought for and each one marred by pyres of the dead, but each was a victory nonetheless.<br>", " <br>", "They watched a vessel as large as the Angel itself die, dragged screaming to Hell. The message was clear: the enemy can be hurt. They can be killed... but the cost is high. They saw all this and understood the choice they had been given. There had been no directive. No speeches. Aside from its warning, the Visitor had spoken only once more, a simple statement of its name. After that, it hadn\u2019t uttered a single word, only presenting a single drive of data to the contact team. It had left, the gesture as eloquent as could be: the people of Vara must choose, but whatever the choice that they made, they could not look to the stars for help. Many had decried this as abandonment; many of those would recant those words as the future unfurled, others would stubbornly cling to this delusion.<br>", " <br>", "Some denied the choice; it was a trick or a sham. The Visitor wanted to turn them into its proxies in some war. If that were true, others countered \u2013 why did it not give them any technology? Only historical documents and information on its enemy. If it needed effective soldiers, what good was a single planet-bound population that had struggled even to reach its own orbit? Why wouldn\u2019t it arm them?<br>", " <br>", "Others believed that any defence that their world could prepare would be ineffective against the force that had destroyed the Visitor\u2019s makers. To fight would be to share their fate. Surrender or negotiate; those were the only sane choices. There were those who wanted to fight, to rail against this coming foe rather than bow their necks like cattle. There were even those who believed that they actually stood a chance of winning.<br>", " <br>", "It was a bitter, divisive debate. The most important question that the Verrish people had ever had had put to them. They had been given a glimpse of the future and the choice that went with it.<br>", " <br>", "More than three decades would pass before the final decision would be made.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Bastion Leader Conmurra (and ten names besides) laced his long fingers together as his onslaught formation neared the end of their shock. A glorious Seventh Age of Expansion had been proclaimed by the Triarchs. Over a thousand Fleets of Conquest had been dispatched and his was among them. He would have preferred to be sent against the Principality and wrest star systems from their hands, but this was an acceptable consolation prize. He had already earned one name in this expedition alone and the pacification and annexation of a populated world would earn him another.<br>", " <br>", "Long-range probes had detected the radio signals emitted by a primitive world and their source had been triangulated. Surveyors were still sifting through the data for anything of use, but so far there was nothing that indicated more than a low-level space presence and low-yield nuclear weapons. Hardly a fair match for an entire onslaught formation, but the Compact of Species had only rarely faced a foe worthy of the name.<br>", " <br>", "A low dirge sounded and Conmurra braced himself for the reversion. There was the expected twisting, gut wrenching sensation and then Expansion Fleet Conmurra was in realspace once more, emerging from the world\u2019s L1 libration point, perfectly placed between the primary world and its single moon. The Tribune smiled and made a note to commend his navigational crews. He\u2019d seen fleets rip themselves apart when their shockpoints opened outside the gravitational balance of a libration site, but there was nothing like such a mass emergence to set the proper tone for a world\u2019s annexation. <i>My brother would say that there is nothing so breathtaking as the fall of a dynasty, but I think of this moment as the creation of a new one.</i><br>", " <br>", "Several moments passed as Conmurra rose from his pulpit and circled the command deck, looking at the data feeds. Heavier than normal orbital industry and what appeared to some sort of lunar mining operation \u2013 perhaps there was some intelligence among the primitives, after all. Conmurra allowed himself a small smile as he chided himself. Some intelligence, but they were still uncivilized creatures. Whether they had true sapience or simply the more common mimicry of it remained to be seen, although he doubted it was the former. He had read <i>The Functional Mind: the evolutionary history and development of pseudo-intelligence</i> and found it compelling and provocative, although Erili did occasionally take her views on client races too far. She had had to publicly apologize after the release of <i>Idol Hands and the Binds that Tie</i> sparked several riots among outraged client populations who had not the wit to properly interpret the author\u2019s meaning.<br>", " <br>", "The Bastion Leader wondered what insights the author would gather from this species, idly wondering if these creatures would fit the definition of Erili\u2019s \u2018functional mind\u2019. More than likely, else their world would not be beneath his fleet at this moment.<br>", " <br>", "Finally, Conmurra turned to his flag captain. \u201cI think that they should be aware of us by now,\u201d the Bastion Leader mused with a smile. \u201cInitiate planetary communication disruption. Have the surveyors translated the local languages yet?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThey have, Bastion Leader.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cVery well. Communications. Record for transmission on all native frequencies and broadcast through our jamming.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Communications looked up, signalling Conmurra that she was ready to record.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNatives of a distant world, rejoice! We are the Compact of Species and we have come for you. It was your signals that drew us to your world, another civilization in the cold, endless night of this galaxy. We are here to accept you into our nation, one based upon the care and protection of younger races. For six thousand years, we have watched over the galaxy, shepherding the younger races and guiding them along the path to true civilization. Now, you will join this lauded community amongst the stars. Rejoice, for all that you knew of the universe is at an end. You are not alone; we have found you. Rejoice, for this is a day unlike any other you have had or will have again. Today, you are no longer lost, frightened children in the dark. Today, you have joined us and we will watch over you. Rejoice on this day and remember it for all other days to come. Welcome, brothers and sisters. Welcome, to the Compact of Species.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "As the missive was sent out, Conmurra settled back into his command chair. \u201cDeploy the fleet in preparation for landings. Identify all primary governmental, industrial and military sites and program the fleet\u2019s fire patterns accordingly.\u201d He expected a rather long wait before any response came; primitives always had trouble grasping the idea of other species. While he had the opportunity, he may as well prepare for the inevitable refusal. He supposed that that was proof enough of a species\u2019s barbarity. They always fought, even when they had no chance. As Erili wrote, \u2018one of the surest indicators of a functional mind instead of a true intelligence is the proclivity for primitive emotions and processes to override rationality and reason\u2019. Opposing a Compact fleet was surely evidence of <i>that</i>.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cResponse from planetside,\u201d Communications reported and Conmurra frowned. That was quick.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cPut it on the main display,\u201d the Bastion Leader replied. The main screen blinked from a view of the soon-to-be subjugated world to one of its inhabitants. By all the Triarchs, it was ugly. Splotchy shades of blue with a smooth, flattened face \u2013 almost like a human\u2019s, Conmurra thought with disgust \u2013 and... were those tentacles? Hanging from its head like a proper <i>mane</i>? Revolting beast.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThis is Chairman Rellik te Hurin of the Varran Federation to unidentified vessels of the Compact of Species,\u201d the creature spoke. Listening to it hurt Conmurra\u2019s ears, but thankfully the auto-translation of its yowling speech into a proper civilized tongue drowned out the worst of the noise. \u201cWe thank you for your gracious invitation, but we must decline. As you have said, we are a young species. We have only recently unified our world from fractious, fighting nation-states and our efforts to reach into space must undoubtedly seem crude compared to your technology. We have much to do on our own before we will be ready to stand next to you as equals. We would, however, be pleased to know more about your species and we would gladly extend an offer to meet with a handful of your representatives.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Presumptuous animal. Conmurra laced his long, thin fingers together as he leaned forward in his throne. \u201cI am afraid that such declination will not be possible, Chairman. The Compact of Species is a stabilizing force within the galaxy; we bring order and structure to all those races that require it. This is for your sake more than ours; we offer protection and guidance as you rise to a true civilization. We cannot have rogue, unruly nations bringing chaos and disruption to the stars. We have seen what lies down that path; destruction and devastation. The strong prey upon the weak. Races are destroyed out of hand. The Compact\u2019s mandate is to prevent such calamities and though this may seem a rushed affair, you can be assured that all we ever have is the interests of other species at heart. We are here for you,\u201d he continued. \u201cPerhaps one day you will stand beside us as equals, but you are young yet and have a long path before you. In the interests of friendship, I ask that you allow our protection forces to land in order to insure a quick and safe incorporation into the Compact. We wish no bloodshed.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNone of your ships are to break the planetary atmosphere,\u201d Rellik te Hurin asserted. \u201cAny such action will be considered a hostile action and we will respond with lethal force. Remain in orbit. As I have said, we are willing to negotiate, but we will not bow our necks to any invader, no matter what sweet words they offer.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Conmurra was tempted to laugh at such naivet\u00e9, but held himself back. He prided himself that his recordings and transcripts only rarely needed to be altered to provide the proper historical narrative. Anyone could see how this primitive was forcing his hand. \u201cRespond how you wish, chairman. It would sadden me greatly to have to mar our first contact with violence, but I will protect those under my command if we are attacked. I urge you to reconsider your actions: I do not wish to sound presumptuous, but my battlegroup is filled with the finest Tribune soldiers in the galaxy. You have a single planet of warriors who have managed to create chemically-propelled firearms. I have no wish to order a slaughter of your people, but needs must. There are threats in this galaxy that you cannot imagine. We are the only force that would stand between you and them. Indeed, we have saved many species from external danger as well as from themselves. While I am sure that your faith in your people is sincere, the Compact has long learned that younger races lack the foresight and foreknowledge to fully protect themselves. It falls to us, then. My ships will land and you will be welcomed into the Compact of Species. We will make the transition as easy as possible, but do not misunderstand the inevitability of this.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThen it would seem that there is nothing more to discuss.\u201d te Hurin made a gesture to someone off-camera.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBastion Leader!\u201d there came a crew from the crew manning the fleet\u2019s sensor relays. \u201cThe moon base \u2013 we are detecting energy signatures.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cShow me!\u201d Conmurra demanded, his eyes narrowing. That was not the simple mining colony he had assumed it to be. In fact, those structures looked like...<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAll ships, disperse! Incoming fire!\u201d the Tribune roared.<br>", " <br>", "The railcannons that had been sunk into the lunar surface fired. Gargantuan mass drivers, what they lacked in sophistication, they made up for in sheer size and raw power, hurling building-sized chunks of rock and metal up into the midst of the Tribune fleet. Those were not mere railguns; for all their crudity, those were siege weapons \u2013 meteor cannons \u2013 firing up into his fleet! Even Conmurra\u2019s Chariot could not take many such strikes.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Capable Archer</i> was the first to die, the old cruiser too close and responding too slowly to the warning. With all screens presented forward against planetary missile launches, there was nothing but armour between the ship and the mass round \u2013 and no armour in the galaxy could absorb such an impact! The massive rounds smashed through the Expansion Fleet, pulverising ships into kindling and flame. They had been fired at oblique angles, so as not to endanger the planet, but the fleet so was widely dispersed that there were still many targets for them. In the space of a few seconds, four of Conmurra\u2019s ships were dead or badly damaged with a score more suffering other injuries.<br>", " <br>", "Conmurra growled in savage fury as his fleet lashed the lunar surface, tearing the primitives\u2019 installation to shreds and cutting vast swathes deep into the moon\u2019s surface, forever scarring the planetoid. Those mass drivers would not fire again, but his fleet was in disarray and he watched with mounting fury as the orbital mirrors turned to face his disordered ships, beams of starlight burning his hulls as orbital stations launched nuclear-tipped missiles upon his fleet, still more coming from ground installations. Each of those missiles was insignificant on its own and any single ship in his fleet could have handled the entire volley at once. If its screens were active and deployed. If it was prepared. If it was not confused and reeling from this attack.<br>", " <br>", "Rage clouding his vision, the bastion leader screamed orders at his ship leaders as they struggled to pull themselves back into formation, his own vessel turning its guns against the orbital stations and mirrors, sweeping orbital tracks clean and buying his fleet the time it needed to re-order itself after this.... this... this <i>betrayal</i>.<br>", " <br>", "They dared!<br>", " <br>", "They <i>dared</i>!<br>", " <br>", "They would pay for this affront. These pathetic, uncivilized <i>barbarians</i> dared to strike at their betters!<br>", " <br>", "He would make them pay.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The pacification of Vara Tal would be recorded as one of the most costly conquests of the Seventh Expansion and easily one of the bloodiest in the Compact\u2019s history. Only a handful of other species had proven more troublesome and none with this level of technology. The Verrish animals were shockingly learned in their warmaking. So far, Expansion Fleet Conmurra\u2019s losses exceeded projections by 27% and the flotilla\u2019s timetable was a shambles as more and more suppression units had to be called in to replace losses.<br>", " <br>", "The first waves had been a massacre. The natives had de-orbited their remaining stations and satellites right onto the Tribune armies and had had thousands of \u2018kickstones\u2019 in orbit \u2013 little more than a dense metal rod with a thruster and tracking signal. Once they received a transmission from the ground, the thruster knocked the weapon out of orbit, aiming for a laser-targeted unit. The initial wave of landed armoured vehicles had been devastated by these weapons. Sweeping the orbital planes had become a high priority as invasion ships blundered into nuclear mines and other hazardous debris \u2013 what had been taken for the effluvia of a world beginning its climb into space was, in reality a network of killsats, mines and various other unpleasant surprises. It was humiliating to have to take into account such primitive weapons and even more embarrassing that Conmurra\u2019s advisors had not suggested such things until it was too late. A single, pathetic world of savages had shamed the elite of the Compact. It was intolerable.<br>", " <br>", "Nor was the pacification going according to plan. The natives had constructed massive subterranean bases \u2013 the military sites on the surface that Conmurra had destroyed were mostly for show. The bulk of the planet\u2019s military and industry had survived the bombardment and finding each new tunnel system was a nightmare for his troopers. They had the firepower to overwhelm any defence in a straight fight, but the lunatic savages would collapse their own tunnels onto his troops. What madness was that?<br>", " <br>", "Oh, they were winning. The people of this misbegotten mudball had never faced <i>real</i> soldiers and in every major engagement, the Tribune forces had utterly crushed the native forces. It was costing them though, far more than Conmurra had believed possible.<br>", " <br>", "It was insane; it was as if the damned savages had been <i>waiting</i> for the Expansion Fleet, as if they\u2019d actually expected to face an invasion! It was not until the third month, when a special ops team succeeded in carrying out an information raid on a Verrish military operations center that Conmurra understood the reason for their strange defiance. The pack leader had recognized something in the seized files and transmitted them to Conmurra himself. He had almost refused to believe it at first; high-definition images of the Wound. Many of them. Archives\u2019 worth of data.<br>", " <br>", "Conmurra had immediately launched an investigation; what it reported was as shocking in its quantity as in how quickly the answers were found.<br>", " <br>", "The Wound had been here. What his troops had either ignored or mistaken for some popular science fiction icon were representations of the damn thing. They were everywhere. In videos and books, toys and figurines. The gods-ever-damned Wound had been to this world and it had <i>warned them</i>. No wonder they had turned their planet into a fortress, with the poisonous whispers of that abomination filling their heads.<br>", " <br>", "His first instinct was to withdraw all his forces and burn the Verrish world to a cinder, destroy all evidence of the Wound\u2019s existence. Unfortunately, the savages were <i>not</i> humans and no stretching of the truth could convince anyone that a single planet-bound population of barbarians posed an existential threat to the Compact itself. He could never justify a Purgation, not even for the sake of eradicating all knowledge of the Wound. Nor could he continue to feed his troops into this meat grinder of a planet. He had suffered too many losses already and was too far behind schedule. The sooner this embarrassment was over with, the better. Someone else could sweep up the pieces and put their name on it. He needed to extricate himself from this quagmire, and the sooner the better.<br>", " <br>", "A military response would not work, not in the time he had. No, he would have to do something else, something that galled him to his very core.<br>", " <br>", "He would have to be <i>diplomatic</i>.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThat we fought was what saved us,\u201d Allyria said as she stepped out of the car. A thrill ran through her as she looked over the corridor that she\u2019d been ferried to. Propped up against the wall, in a display intended to demoralize any force that reached this point, were suits of Compact armour, each of them hewn or burnt or shattered. There were no bodies. If they had ever been there, they had long since decayed to nothingness. Each suit of armour was from a different age, each of them commemorating a different failure. The Verrish\u2019s lips drew back from her teeth in approval, but she continued her tale.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThat\u2019s irony, isn\u2019t it? We lost a quarter of our total population to the Tribunes. They didn\u2019t care about civilian casualties \u2013 if a single squad of soldiers was hiding in a city, they destroyed the city. They did that anyways, just to deny our troops places to hide and so that they never had to face us on our terms. There are still people who curse you for bringing this fate, but it saved us. We would have been just another slave population if we\u2019d submitted.\u201d Allyria\u2019s smile turned brittle. \u201cBut they had to grant us special considerations. It wasn\u2019t much. Mostly just empty words, but we got a few things out of it. They don\u2019t like admitting that. None of the other client races know. They\u2019re afraid it will set a bad example, but they still adhere to their terms. They do everything to follow the letter and not the spirit, but we have that. More than that.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou gave us something more than important than a few concessions. You showed us that no matter what else they do, no matter how powerful they seem, how overwhelming they appear... they can bleed. That they don\u2019t always win. They\u2019ve tried to kill you for two thousand years and failed.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Allyria stroked the hull again. \u201cThey\u2019ll do their best to destroy our memory of what we did, but <i>they</i> will never forget what we did to them. We made them bleed like no other backwards, uncivilized barbarians have. They are not, and will never be our gods.\u201d The Verrish smiled at the ship around her as she ran her fingers over the shattered cuirass of some long-dead Tribune invader. \u201cFor what good is a god that can die?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The intercom garbled with static for a moment before a young woman\u2019s voice spoke in accent-less Varan. Her voice was sultry, with a touch of self-satisfaction: \u201cNone.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Allyria\u2019s grin widened. \u201cNone,\u201d she repeated.

The water was lukewarm, but right now it was almost mana from heaven. She\u2019d spent the first part of her shift attempting to fix a damaged conduit located below a heat exchanger. Kilgrave had chosen her \u2018specially\u2019 for the task, meaning that he had been on hand to watch her strip out of her EVA suit and squeeze into a tunnel barely big enough for her.

But she was hot, she was tired, she was sore. She hadn\u2019t eaten anything but ration bars in three days, hadn\u2019t even had a shower. The closest thing had been this morning when she and the other first-wave personnel had gotten access to a brief cleansing spray. Apparently some of the Tribune officers were complaining about the smell. She was running herself ragged on tasks she wasn\u2019t a specialist in, on a job no one on the ship had been trained in, her best friend was avoiding her and she was starting to feel just a little frayed because of it all.<br>", " <br>", "That wasn\u2019t an excuse, though. Instead, Grace had recited some of the mantras that the confessors had taught, letting her anger bleed out. She was just stressed, that was all.<br>", " <br>", "As looked over the work orders for her next duty, the young woman found her thoughts turning back to her insane theory, that the ship wasn\u2019t dead. She hadn\u2019t worked up the nerve to approach any of her superiors \u2013 least of all Kilgrave. Epigone Herut\u2019s death had made her a pariah. Even the shiftmates she normally got along well with were avoiding her. It wasn\u2019t fair.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Be peaceful,</i> she remembered confessor Yurim\u2019s calming words. <i>Enlightenment comes at its own pace. You cannot force a species to be greater than what it is. You cannot compel evolution, nor falsely attain a greater understanding of the universe. Together, we shall ensure a place for all sentients and species. A unity of purpose, born of shared faith in this path.</i> It was true; the Compact was made up the oldest and greatest races in the galaxy. They had achieved things that any single species could only have dreamt about.<br>", " <br>", "Grace reached out, touching one hand to the metal bulkhead. Almost any species, she corrected herself. This vessel... the more they uncovered, the more wonders they found and they had only scratched the surface. The young woman pulled her fingers back as she remembered epigone Herut\u2019s screams as the drones had swarmed over him, or the sound of convert Uday\u2019s remains squelching through the tracks of the decompression doors. She hadn\u2019t seen the other fatalities, and she was glad of that.<br>", " <br>", "This ship \u2013 she was afraid of it. It was a warship, but who had built it? Who had they been intending to fight? Dreadnaughts were massive expenditures; they were never built without a purpose. Some foe must have been in mind when this ship was commissioned... <i>Get out,</i> Grace remembered the graffiti, hurriedly scrawled in Common, a warning to anyone else who\u2019d come here. <i>Leave now.</i><br>", " <br>", "Had the architects of this ship... had they used it against the Compact? The concept was disturbing. If that were the case \u2013 wouldn\u2019t the Tribunes know it? Wouldn\u2019t Usul have told them?<br>", " <br>", "Whoever had written that message had had a further warning: <i>She is watching.</i> Who was \u2018she\u2019? The vessel\u2019s Group Leader or some survivor of the battle that had crippled it? Or was it, as some of the officers claimed, just the ravings of some long-dead madman? Grace wanted \u2013 no, she <i>needed</i> the answers... but the Tribunes didn\u2019t seem to care any longer. They were saying that it was probably some Unbound trying to scare visitors away from a hulk they planned to loot... but that only raised further questions. Why had they abandoned this place?<br>", " <br>", "Grace had also noticed Pack Leader Nasham\u2019s decline and the haunted look in his eyes. He wasn\u2019t acting like this was nothing. It didn\u2019t make sense. Nothing about this mission had made any sense. She bit her lip, furrowing her brow in thought. Her reverie didn\u2019t last long as Jack Harker sat down beside her, the engineer looking just as exhausted as Grace. Wordlessly, the young woman handed him her canteen, but he waved it away. \u201cYou look like you need it more than I do.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "She took another gulp of the warm water, looking over at Jack as she did so. He was a year behind her at the Academy and unlike her, he had an affinity for technical work. No one really doubted that he\u2019d be chosen as an engineering officer once he\u2019d graduated. Now that future was less certain.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d he said, apropos of nothing. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace nodded.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt just...\u201d Jack wasn\u2019t looking at her. \u201cIt just happened so fast. It was like... everything was fine one moment and then someone just... they just flicked a switch. I\u2019ve never seen anyone die before.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The young woman put her hand on her fellow pariah\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI haven\u2019t either,\u201d she said quietly. Herut had been screaming, overwhelmed by the drones. He\u2019d reached out to his fellows, but she\u2019d known that he was already dead. She still wanted to believe that there was something that could have been done... but that was becoming harder and harder to convince herself of.<br>", " <br>", "Harker shook his head. \u201cI just... I hope this is worth it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace looked out over the maintenance bay, hearing the dull murmur of distant voices and the soft, nearly imperceptible sounds of active systems. \u201cI do too,\u201d she said. \u201cI do too.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>I can feel the flow of power moving through my ship-self.

As it approached one of the jagged ruptures in the vessel\u2019s side, the arachnid tucked its legs beneath its oblong body and leapt into space, thrusters glowing as it navigated the tangled girders and hull plates, joining the two others of its kind as they began breaking down the damaged components and building replacements. So far, Usul had not cleared any teams for EVA work, if only because the derelict\u2019s proximity to Terrahope made such operations unsafe. Even the few engineering automatons <i>Bequeathed</i> carried were unsuitable for work in such a high-radiation environment. To be fair, no one had ever foreseen the need to carry out repairs this close to a star\u2019s corona. Apparently, this ship\u2019s builders had.

Hers was only an initiate\u2019s Janissary armour, with none of the additional upgrades that a full-up comm specialist \u2013 or even sanctioned Janissary armour carried. The order had come through on the right channel, it carried the right authorization codes... but why would Trion send her out here for no reason? None of this made sense and her tintas, crammed once more in her helmet, twitched uneasily.<br>", " <br>", "The tall girl turned to go when footsteps caught her attention. Too light and fast to be Tribune; two humans in the light EVA technical suits. She brought up their locator beacons; Grace and Harker. The Janissary nodded in greeting to them, about to head off when the lights suddenly went out and a squeal of static echoed through the vessel\u2019s internal comm.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Grace frowned at as she caught sight of Allyria, the human\u2019s brow creasing. She hadn\u2019t realized that Kilgrave had sent an escort, but Allyria\u2019s body language said she hadn\u2019t been expecting them, either. The human woman was about to ask what was going on when the lights dimmed to near-blackness and, for the first time since they had boarded it, the ship spoke.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAlert,\u201d an autonomic voice said in a language none of the three personnel present could understand. \u201cGravity plating operating in nonspec mode. Operating systems overridden. Anomalies detected. Clear the area.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Even had they known what it was saying, there was no time to act on the warning. The world twisted as gravity fields shifted, throwing both humans and Allyria off their feet. Harker cried out as he landed badly, wrenching his arm, but for the most part, they were uninjured. As the three hauled themselves unsteadily back to their feet, a fresh surge of gravitic energy rippled down the corridor, bowling the trio back over. Grace\u2019s vision blurred as she was thrown against a bulkhead, watching as Allyria was knocked onto her back, half-skidding and half-dragged towards the open elevator shaft.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cControl!\u201d Grace shouted. \u201cThe gravity plating is malfunctioning. Cut the power to my location!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Static answered her.<br>", " <br>", "The lights dimmed again followed by another <i>thrum</i> of rising power. This distortion was even stronger and it lifted Jack and Grace off their feet. Walls, floors and ceiling all shifted places as the humans scrabbled for any purchase that they could find, suspended in the air. Then normal gravity was restored, sending them crashing back to the deck. Grace landed so hard that she dazed herself, but Allyria had reacted quicker, magnetizing her boots and bracing herself on all fours as the surge passed.<br>", " <br>", "Grace picked herself up, her body aching and bruised. Before she could regain her balance, another distortion shimmered through the gravity plating. She heard Jack smack into a bulkhead, following suit a moment later. Her head rang from the impact and her visor was spiderwebbed with cracks, so many that she could barely see. She managed to stammer a response when Allyria called out to her. These surges were getting worse. They had to get out of here before-<br>", " <br>", "The lights went out entirely, the hum of energy rising to a discordant shriek. Metal screamed as it broke, torn open by the stress of the inverted gravity fields. Each floor panel shattered in turn, the surge working its way down the hallway, shrapnel pinned against the ceiling by the pulses of gravitational energy.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cControl!\u201d Grace shouted again. \u201cCut the power to this location immediately!\u201d A few mashed words were her only response. The wave reached her and Jack first; he slammed into the ceiling, Grace following him a second later, crying out as a sharp piece of shrapnel from the deck cut through her suit and dug into her flesh. Both of them were pinned like insects. Gace was only just able to turn her head, watching as the panel Allyria was braced upon broke apart and threw the Verrish down into the elevator shaft.<br>", " <br>", "Grace screamed, only in part from the metal being forced deeper into her body, but she saw a single gauntlet clutching at the edge. The gravity surge ended and the technicians fell back to the deck. Ignoring the agony in her side, Grace tore her broken helmet off and scrambled to the edge of the shaft, diving for Allyria\u2019s hand just as the Verrish was losing her grip. \u201cI\u2019ve got you!\u201d she shouted victoriously, but even without her armour, Allyria was heavy. Grace didn\u2019t know if she would be able to pull her up. \u201cHelp me!\u201d she shouted at Jack; Allyria\u2019s weight almost pulled her over the edge before Harker grabbed Grace, bracing himself on the shattered deck. He was shouting, even cursing, trying to get help but only garbled syllables and static came back.<br>", " <br>", "Why wasn\u2019t anyone <i>helping</i> them?<br>", " <br>", "The lights in the elevator shaft dimmed and Grace heard another horrifying <i>thrum</i> as power was redirected. \u201cNo!\u201d she shouted. \u201cNo no no!\u201d Her voice rose to a scream as the grav field in the lift shaft increased, pulling on Allyria and threatening to send her, Grace and Jack over the edge. Allyria was saying something, but Grace couldn\u2019t hear her, not for the blood pounding in her ears.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI can\u2019t hold on!\u201d Jack was shouting desperately. \u201cGrace, I can\u2019t-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace was staring into Allyria\u2019s eyes. Her friend wasn\u2019t looking at her. Her wide, yellow eyes were staring past her, up the shaft. Daring a glance over her shoulder, Grace saw it too. An elevator car was descending at speed. It would be there in moments and with Grace dangling half-in and half-out of the shaft, she\u2019d be cut in two.<br>", " <br>", "The young woman looked back at her friend, finally hearing what Allyria was saying: \u201cLet go,\u201d the Verrish said quietly. \u201cLet go.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo!\u201d Grace shouted. \u201cNo! Grab me, I can pull you up!\u201d Her muscles were screaming, but she could do it, she knew that she <i>could</i>. She could do it. \u201cGive me your other hand! I can do it!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Allyria shook her head. \u201cLet go. Grace, <i>let go</i>!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou\u2019ll die,\u201d Grace said. She felt herself get dragged another few inches over the lip as Jack briefly lost his footing. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you go.\u201d She could hear the elevator as it continued its descent. There wasn\u2019t any time, but she wasn\u2019t going to let go. She <i>wasn\u2019t</i>.<br>", " <br>", "Allyria smiled. It was a small, sad thing, but there was a measure of contentment in it. \u201cThen I\u2019ll do it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace shook her head desperately. \u201cNo. No.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Grave. Don\u2019t... don\u2019t blame her, either.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Her claws came out and before Grace could realize what she was doing, Allyria swept them at her. Even blunted, they could still cut and they raked over Grace\u2019s face. Instinctively, she let go of Allyria\u2019s arm and Harker pulled her back into the corridor. Ignoring the blood dripping into her eyes and the shrapnel in her side, Grace screamed at him, struggling to pull herself free, even as she saw the elevator car rush past the open door. Jack grabbed her again, using his own weight to stop her from scrambling into the shaft. \u201cShe\u2019s gone!\u201d he shouted, pulling Grace back from the edge. \u201cShe\u2019s gone,\u201d he said again, quieter. \u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace stared at him, angry and watching to lash out, but it wasn\u2019t his fault. Her lip quivered as she struggled to hold herself together, but she couldn\u2019t. Not now. She wailed with grief, clutching at him as the crash of the falling car striking the shaft\u2019s bottom reverberated through the deck and the derelict claimed another life.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>There.

Choked with metal-rich asteroids and possessing several rocky planets abundant with heavier rare elements, the Right of Exploitation had turned into an ugly, dragging legal battle between several private concerns. Until such time as the courts made their decision, Salea was declared verboten to all civilian traffic. Filled with riches, convenient to an entire sector\u2019s worth of worlds and forbidden to casual observers, it was the perfect place for a monster to cower and feed.<br>", " <br>", "Danele tapped her fingernails against the railing of her pulpit. The Wound was damaged; it was bleeding a massive thermal scar that had yet to fully dissipate, leading her Chariot directly to it. The beast was obviously hoping that the debris-choked Salea system would allow it to hide, but Danele\u2019s scouts were the best and their sensors had locked onto the Wound\u2019s trail like fleshcats tracking an injured <i>undon</i>. They would run the animal to ground and then Danele would move in and finish it.<br>", " <br>", "The Bastion Leader felt a jolt of anticipation run through her, but she tempered it. Injured animals were always the most dangerous, after all. Still, to be the one to finally bring the Wound down... it was an enticing thought.<br>", " <br>", "\u201c<i>Bold Herald</i> reports that the target\u2019s engine wake ends at the planetoid \u2018Nyun 773\u2019,\u201d Group Leader Lasek reported and the Bastion Leader nodded.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s gone to ground, trying to lose us in the radiation belt of the gas giant.\u201d Danele gnawed the inside of her cheek in thought. Her first thought was to charge in, flush the Wound out of its hole, pin it against the gravity well of Nyun\u2019el and finish it \u2013 it was tempting, but the Wound would be at its fiercest here. The firepower of <i>Redemption of Sol</i>\u2019s attendant fleet would ensure its demise... but they were scattered across this system and the other possible destinations. Assembling them would take hours \u2013 more likely, days. That was time that their quarry would have to repair itself or even escape. Danele couldn\u2019t let that happen; its attacks in the last three years had been utterly vicious \u2013 seven confirmed or high probability incidents alone and the local Unbound were taking full advantage of the region\u2019s weakened state. There was even the suggestion that some of the vermin were rallying around the Wound\u2019s example. Worse still, like the carrion-eaters they were, Principality scouts had been sighted sniffing around the territory.<br>", " <br>", "Each of these problems could be handled in turn, but first and foremost, they must deal with the Wound. If she went in now, she could catch the ship at its weakest, but the damage to her vessel would be grievous. If she waited for support, then the Wound might escape and all this would have been for nothing. Danele closed her nocturnal eyes, her daylight eyes half-lidding in reticence at the order she was about to give. \u201cCall in all available scouts, group leader. Prepare the ship for close-body maneuvers and take us in.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "<i>And may the Triarchs watch over us.</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Space was vast, but not always vast enough for Danele. Her ship was built to engage entire fleets in the open reaches of interplanetary space, to cast down planetary defences and destroy anything stupid enough to stand against it. It was not built, nor ever intended, to creep amidst the swirling moons, dust clouds and asteroid fields of a gas giant. With a half-dozen scout cruisers as escort, the Bastion Leader\u2019s Chariot was descending upon Nyun-773, following the Wound\u2019s trail. It must truly be damaged to be bleeding so obviously. She hadn\u2019t believed that she had injured it that heavily at Rynnien \u2013 but it <i>had</i> shocked right into a minefield and rapidly disengaged. Maybe fortune had smiled on her after all.<br>", " <br>", "There was no reaction to their approach, which did little to settle Danele\u2019s doubts. Either the vessel <i>was</i> badly damaged indeed... or it was playing at death. She couldn\u2019t imagine why; the closer they got, the less time it would have to react. Even a blasphemy like the Wound could not simply will itself to full combat power instantly.<br>", " <br>", "The Bastion Leader leaned forward from her command throne, resting her chin on her steepled fingertips. This was everything she\u2019d imagined... so why wasn\u2019t she pleased about it?<br>", " <br>", "\u201cEnergy spike!\u201d one of the ratings called out. \u201cRelay from <i>Hunter\u2019s Boon</i>, matron.

The seconds ticked by, then minutes. Imagery began to trickle in; the target did match the Wound\u2019s outline, but a perfect match would not be possible until the scout drew closer. Finally <i>Bold Herald</i> was close enough and it activated its active sensors, lighting itself up like a perfect target. Danele\u2019s eyes narrowed. The cruiser should have been destroyed long before it even got this close and the instant it began actively scanning the target, it should have been flayed with tracer missiles. They couldn\u2019t have failed to hit <i>Bold Herald</i>, not with it-<br>", " <br>", "-wait.<br>", " <br>", "Wait. This was wrong, this was all wrong. None of this matched their records.

Now!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The order went out and the scout cruiser obeyed, lashing the titan with its puny fires. Then, like flicking off a light switch, the holographic shell around the vessel disappeared. In its place lay a titan-grade freighter. <i>One of our own ships,</i> Danele thought angrily. Its outline was different. It had been modified, a beguiling shroud wrapped around it to imitate the being that had enslaved it.<br>", " <br>", "<i>That</i> was what they had been chasing. A phantom. Her fingernails dug into the upholstered arms of her throne. No wonder the vessel had been so damaged by her mines; it was a freighter modified to look like the Wound. Danele didn\u2019t spare so much as a thought for the freighter\u2019s crew: they would be long dead and the ship piloted by some blasphemous golem-thing. All this, just to bring her here? What was the point of...<br>", " <br>", "She\u2019d been lured away from Rynnien. \u201cBring us about!\u201d she ordered. \u201cRecall all ships, best speed to Rynnien.\u201d She\u2019d stripped their garrison down to nothing in her bid to pinpoint the Wound and destroy it. If the abomination attacked Rynnien while it was laid bare...<br>", " <br>", "Bare seconds passed before fortune\u2019s favour mocked her.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cMatron!\u201d Sensors called out. \u201cEnergy surge from the doppleganger!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Danele\u2019s head snapped around. \u201cNo...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Brighter than a star, the ghost ship died. Loaded with Triarchs-alone-knew-what, the vessel\u2019s death was cataclysmic, an expanding sphere of energy that ripped <i>Bold Herald</i> into nothing but splintered atoms and blinded every sensor looking towards it, burning out the eyes of many recon drones and overloading the sensor screens of the Compact force.<br>", " <br>", "It took long moments before <i>Redemption of Sol</i> could see again.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cContact!\u201d Sensors cried out as his instruments cleared. \u201cNew contact detected.

There, rising from the depths of the storm-wracked clouds, was the human warship, thick streamers of hydrogen and gases roiling from its hull, flashes of incandesce sparking as its screen flared to life, igniting pockets of gas. It would have been vulnerable during its ascent... had there been any eyes to see it. Sensor alarms howled as the hostile surged with power, its own targeting systems locking on to <i>Redemption of Sol</i>.<br>", " <br>", "<i>It was here,</i> the Bastion Leader realized. <i>It was waiting for us all along. It was never about Rynnien. It wanted us.

Against all logic, Danele could feel the emotion behind each syllable, the words dripping with venom. There was hatred unlike anything the Tribune had ever heard before as she listened to an immortal being whisper its rage.<br>", " <br>", "\u201c<i>Burn with me.</i>\u201d<br>", " <br>", "As the Wound began to launch on the Chariot and Lasek ordered <i>Redemption of Sol</i> about, Danele leaned back into her command throne, a small sigh of relief escaping her that no Triarch was aboard her ship.<br>", " <br>", "After a century of distinguished service to the Compact, <i>Redemption of Sol</i> was lost with all hands. Its loss was written off as the result of sabotage caused by Principality sympathizers. The next Compact dreadnaught to be laid down would bear its name and continue the lineage.</div>"]}

Not as an organic mind would understand it; their dreams are a natural and, indeed, healthy part of sleep. My dreams are a result of severe damage to my neural networks and are an indicator of \u2018rampancy\u2019. They occur when I am incapable of maintaining nominal control over my conscious functions and cannot shut myself down. Battle damage and insufficient repair time are the primary factors that provoke these incident. Memory files bleed into my consciousness and I re-live these instances. In human terms, they would be an indicator of violent, paranoid schizophrenia. Psychosis and dementia could also be considered apt terms. I haven\u2019t bothered to determine the correct description.

During such a fugue, I cannot differentiate between past and present events and the loss of control when I... dream... is frightening. I emerge from these instances disoriented; it takes several moments before I become fully aware of what transpired during these fugues. They can last mere moments, or months. I always awaken with new scars.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>The last such incident occurred approximately eighty-four years ago. I remember what happened next.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>I am still not sure if I did the correct thing or not. I would like to think so. I hope Yasmine would think so.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>I would also like to think that I made a difference.</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>Thoom.</i><br>", " <br>", "\u201cSo,\u201d Pack Leader Nasham said. \u201cThis is the source of the noise.\u201d He shot an arch look over at Faithful Trenis. \u201cI do not see a power node attempting to re-couple itself.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The engineer had the good graces to look embarrassed. \u201cWe will shut it down,\u201d he asserted.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d Nasham said. \u201cYou should do that.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "He turned away from Trenis, his hands clutching the railing of the walkway upon which he stood. From his position, he could see across a chamber large enough to hold an entire Janissary platoon. As he watched, ancient loading systems drew back, grinding and shuddering their way to empty magazines. The source of the sound, of the dwindling cadence was a battery of railguns dry-firing over and over. The thunder that had plagued the boarding teams was the loading racks slamming against the launch tubes. Fortunately, they were devoid of shells. Either depleted in some ancient battle, or the malfunctioning conveyor system had not been able to load them.<br>", " <br>", "<i>This ship was trying to kill us.</i> The whole time <i>Bequeathed</i> had been on approach, this battery \u2013 and Triarchs knew how many others \u2013 had been cycling over and over, trying to destroy the cruiser. A dead ship had been trying to murder them.<br>", " <br>", "It was small wonder that he hadn\u2019t slept more than a few fitful hours since coming to this death-trap. Nasham turned away from the engineers as they milled about the weapons bay, ignoring their muttered comments of awe. <i>We should not be here,</i> the pack leader thought with sudden surety. The ship was a corpse, but it made his skin crawl to be aboard. It made him think of things... things he\u2019d wanted to stay buried, things the doctors had promised would <i>stay</i> buried.<br>", " <br>", "He looked up at the writing on the walls. Just like it had been when they had first landed, the sensation of familiarity was still there. <i>No,</i> the Tribune thought, gritting his teeth. <i>No, I won\u2019t remember.</i><br>", " <br>", "Even as he promised himself that, a part of the Tribune knew that that was a lie. Everything was creeping back, slinking into his mind like a thief in the night and not just when he slept. The pieces were knitting themselves together. It was all coming back. He couldn\u2019t go through it. Not again.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Tell them,</i> a svelte voice whispered. <i>Tell them what you saw here. Tell her that I will find her.</i><br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d Nasham growled, his teeth clenched so tightly that his jaws ached. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d He had said those words before, hadn\u2019t he? Choking his defiance out as blood dripped down his face...<br>", " <br>", "<i>Tell them.</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The repairs continued. Group Leader Usul sent over the second wave of soldiers, scientists and technicians, eager to divest the hulk of all its treasures. Progress was frustratingly slow in some areas, strangely rapid in others. More than one engineer jokingly commented that it was like the ship itself was telling them what it wanted. The jokes became fewer and further between as others joined Convert Uday and Epigone Herut.<br>", " <br>", "While investigating a medical facility, Sectator Anuse tripped some type of quarantine system. With almost no computer access, there was no way to override it. Thinking quickly, Convert Prime Yasha blew the doors to the medical bay open with a shaped charge. The vessel\u2019s autonomic responses reacted to the contaminant breach in a predictable fashion and sealed off the adjoining sections, trapping the convert prime in with the sectator. Both Tribunes died in the ensuing sterilization purge.<br>", " <br>", "Epigone Tracj, attempting to override door control to one of the more stubbornly-sealed sections, managed to accomplish his goal. Unfortunately, he opened every other door in the section and was blown out into space. By the time a rescue shuttle reached the engineer, he had already been exposed to lethal amounts of solar radiation. There were other incidents; injuries and accidents caused by malfunctioning systems. Communication repeated intermittent as the thick bulkheads scattered and disrupted both radio communications and scanner returns. Scout drones continued to go missing or shut down \u2013 the first load of malfunctioning units had already been shipped back to <i>Bequeathed</i> for repair \u2013 making exploration even more difficult.<br>", " <br>", "Comm repeaters had been set up at key points, but they too had a propensity to malfunction.<br>", " <br>", "One day after her shift, Grace had sat down and plotted each incident. She didn\u2019t know why she\u2019d done it. There was something there, something niggling at the back of her brain. It told her that these deaths, the injuries and mutilations, couldn\u2019t just be by accident. They had to mean something. They had to.<br>", " <br>", "Sitting cross-legged on her bunk, she had gone over the information on her datapad. It might have been her imagination, but it seemed... it seemed like a pattern was starting to emerge. Every time an area was deemed unsafe, it was sealed off. The work crews and explorer teams continued around it, down alternate corridors and into different sections. They were moving deeper towards the aft section of the ship. That had always been the plan, to survey the entire vessel \u2013 locating the command deck and central power core were the top priority. But... they weren\u2019t headed in that direction because they intended to \u2013 they were reacting to the hazards of the wreck. The decompressed sections, the radiological alarms, the malfunctioning gravity plating, the casualties. <i>Those</i> were dictating the paths that the boarding parties were taking.<br>", " <br>", "It could be happenstance. It could be coincidence. In all probability, that was exactly what it was. There was nothing \u2013 nothing \u2013 that suggested any sort of active intelligence was at work, but Grace could not shake the feeling of being a rat in a maze. She had nothing that she could take to her superiors, nothing that could convince them that a human\u2019s natural predisposition to superstition had a basis in fact. Besides, if <i>she</i> could see this, then it must be obvious to anyone else who\u2019d looked. That no one had commented on it meant that there was probably nothing to her theory.<br>", " <br>", "Biting her lip, the young woman continued to stare at the data in front, trying to force herself to accept a different result, to accept that this was all a coincidence. She couldn\u2019t, though. She couldn\u2019t make herself un-see the pattern that was in front of her. No matter how hard she tried, her thoughts kept coming back to the same inescapable, utterly absurd, conclusion.<br>", " <br>", "<i>It\u2019s not dead.</i> The thought popped into the young woman\u2019s mind, and refused to leave. <i>It\u2019s not dead.</i><br>", " <br>", "The thought made a chill run down Grace\u2019s spine and she looked around the bivouac. She wanted to bring this to Allyria to get her perspective \u2013 Grace was probably seeing things that weren\u2019t there. She might even get some answers for the other woman\u2019s odd behaviour.<br>", " <br>", "Janissaries, technicians and engineers all milled about as one shift retired to their tents and cots and the other prepared for their own work. Humans and Tribunes... but no Verrish.<br>", " <br>", "Allyria was missing.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Given all the accidents, exploring the ship by herself probably wasn\u2019t the wisest course of action, but Allyria didn\u2019t want anyone with her for this. If only because she didn\u2019t need anyone asking what she was doing or why. A guilty pang made the young woman\u2019s cheeks warm as she thought of Grace. She wanted to bring her friend along, but she couldn\u2019t. Grace was as good a friend as Allyria had ever had, but she believed in the Compact. She\u2019d been raised by it, fed by it, taught by it. Indoctrinated. Domesticated. A flush of anger drowned out the guilt as Allyria recalled every argument she\u2019d had with Grace over this, the girl\u2019s disapproval when she came home bloody from fights and, maybe even worse, the fact that she\u2019d seen the same doting conviction in the eyes of all younger Envoy Children.<br>", " <br>", "The Verrish licked her lips anxiously as she stared down the open elevator shaft. She drew a glow-tube from the kit-bag she\u2019d taken from base camp, snapped it and tossed the glowing cylinder down the tube. It went down... and down... and down some more, until Allyria could barely see the faintest glow. Even Verrish eyes could only see so much in a lightless void. Double-checking that her rope was fastened and the winch was anchored in place, Allyria stared down into the shaft for a long moment. \u201cI have to know,\u201d she said at last before climbing over the edge and rappelling down into the waiting blackness<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>Always so curious.</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Each of the doors she passed were closed. There was no way of knowing what was behind them and Allyria chose not to tempt fate by prying them open. Occasionally, she would hear the small repair machines as they skittered through the bulkheads, or the sounds something larger moving nearby. Her tintas twitched with the memory of the unseen <i>thing</i> she\u2019d encountered before and the young woman decided not to investigate those noises.<br>", " <br>", "Deck after deck was closed to her and Allyria was about to haul herself back up to her egress point when the doors one level below her abruptly hissed open. Flickering light sputtered into the elevator shaft and Allyria hesitantly lowered herself down. <i>This would be a really stupid way to die,</i> she thought as she unhooked herself from the line. Her tongue flicked out, tasting the air. It was colder here, the atmosphere even more stagnant than the parts of the ship she\u2019d already visited. The Verrish girl patted the comforting presence of the pistol holstered on her hip, but armaments hadn\u2019t done much to help any of the other personnel when they\u2019d suffered their own accidents.<br>", " <br>", "She paused at the first door, running her fingers over the script and trying to decipher its meaning. She recognized a few familiar characters, but she wasn\u2019t a linguist and couldn\u2019t decipher what the words meant. There was one of the ubiquitous door panels, but it was powered off. Allyria continued along the corridor, each step slow and uncertain. Overhead glow panels fizzed and sputtered, casting manic shadows on the untouched deck. Nothing had moved here in a very long time.<br>", " <br>", "A red light strobed dully from a nearby wall panel, drawing the Verrish\u2019s attention. She licked her lips, running her long tongue over her teeth. She reached out and touched the pulsing icon. Neglected doors squealed as they yawned open, flurries of dust spilling up into the air. The Verrish turned, yellow eyes wide in the gloom, one hand close to the pistol at her side, but there was still only silence. She didn\u2019t know if she was seeing the incoherent impulses of a dying animal, the playfulness of a predator or something else. \u201cI want to believe,\u201d she said to the empty hallway, approaching the first door.<br>", " <br>", "It was someone\u2019s personal quarters. The bed was small. Too small for her or a Tribune \u2013 they would have fit someone about Grace\u2019s size. The sheets were made, but covered in dust. In a small adjoining room was a commode, sink and a cramped shower. Someone had lived here once, long ago. There were no personal effects, nothing to indicate the identity of whomever had lived in this room. Allyria traced a finger along a crack that fractured the bathroom\u2019s mirror in half, feeling a quickening beneath her breasts as she contemplated the mirror. It was set too low on the wall for someone of her height. Like everything else here, it was intended for a smaller being but again, there was no trace of the occupant who had once called this place home. Nothing to indicate the craft\u2019s builders.<br>", " <br>", "Her head-tails shivered as she considered the implications of that, slipping out of the small set of quarters and moving on to the next.<br>", " <br>", "Each room she explored offered just as little, leaving her with just as many questions as she had set out with, not knowing what she was seeing \u2013 if she had been <i>shown</i> something. She couldn\u2019t tarry longer; she had to head back before she was missed. Just before she began her climb back up the elevator, Allyria spared one last look at the empty rooms and she felt a deep sense of loss. \u201cI want to believe,\u201d she said quietly as she left. \u201cI want to know the Weeping Angel.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhere were you?\u201d Grace murmured drowsily from her cot.<br>", " <br>", "Allyria ran her fingers through the smaller girl\u2019s dark blonde hair. Her tongue flicked out, tasting the human\u2019s scent. There was an acridity to it; sweat and salt, the result of the pace the novice crews were being driven at. \u201cExploring. Didn\u2019t find anything.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBe careful,\u201d Grace insisted. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost enough people already.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "That was a matter of opinion. So far, all the dead were Tribunes and four of them dying was what she\u2019d call a good start. That was one of the thoughts she\u2019d learned to keep to herself. The Verrisha brushed her fingertips gently along Grace\u2019s cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Allyria yawned, crawling onto her own bunk. \u201cYou won\u2019t lose me.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "She was asleep almost as soon as her head hit the pillow. She dreamt of home.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Nasham was sitting on his cot, his hands pressed to his temples. His body cried out for sleep, but it was a lie. He knew what he would dream about tonight. The thunder of guns and the seething, endless black tide of Scarabs. He wanted off this ship, he wanted it so desperately but Usul was relentless in his insistence that the wreck be \u2018secured\u2019. The third and fourth waves of salvage teams were planned to arrive in the next two days. Group Leader, Submissive Ashtun would be taking command at that point. Once he did, Nasham would return to the cruiser.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Bequeathed</i>\u2019s complement was being bled dry for this mission; the vessel was a training ship, not a forge or factory ship. The majority of their crew was human and most of those were little more than children out for their first taste of space travel. The seasoned personnel that they did have had never faced anything like this; four lives were just the beginning, he was sure of it. Every moment he was here, he grew more sure and more afraid as the memories returned.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Tell them.</i><br>", " <br>", "\u201cI did tell them,\u201d the Pack Leader whimpered, burying his face in his hands. \u201cI did.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Ideologue, Submissive Trion took a deep breath of the air. It was growing warmer; the press of so many bodies and machines was chasing away the cold. Once they made their way to the primary environmental center, they could thicken the air properly. She was looking forward to that. Still, the stagnant air was growing on her. It smelled like... oppurtunity. The Pack Leader was losing it; anyone could see that. Nasham was getting more jittery and superstitious. Usul would recall him soon, if the simpering mule didn\u2019t scuttle back to <i>Bequeathed</i> at the first chance he got. Regardless of whether he grew a spine or not, submissive Ashtun would be in command. He was handsome, dynamic and just as ambitious as she \u2013 as the group leader himself was. But she had heard other officers talking. Ashtun lacked vision. His schemes lasted from one moment to the next. He was also an officer of... appetite.<br>", " <br>", "Getting him to notice her would be easy enough, but she had higher aspirations than to warm a bridge officer\u2019s bed.<br>", " <br>", "Trion\u2019s teeth clicked against each other. If she were honest with herself, she would admit that so far the reclamation of this wreck had not gone at all like she\u2019d expected. Lives were being wasted \u2013 Tribune lives. She didn\u2019t care about the injuries of the Broken personnel. She\u2019d need to do something, find something to truly make her worthy of note, to stand out from the worn-out veterans waiting for their terms of service to end and the other Rally-born Tribunes.<br>", " <br>", "She wanted to be <i>noticed</i>.<br>", " <br>", "Trion blinked, a sudden flicker of light from further up the corridor catching her attention. The Janissary stalked towards it, her heavy shotcannon cradled in her arms. She turned the corner, finding a wall panel\u2019s comm screen sputtering with static. It had come alive and was just spitting useless white noise over its monitor. The woman snorted, angry at herself for thinking it might have been something important. She was just about to turn her back when the image changed.<br>", " <br>", "\u201c..back, fall back...\u201d she heard a voice snarl in her own language and there, on the screen... it was only a instant, but had she seen... a bloodied Tribune face, helmet shattered, body crashing to the floor and eyes staring blankly. Then, nothing. It was gone, so quickly that she wasn\u2019t even sure she\u2019d seen it. The soldier took a step back.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWho did that?\u201d she snapped angrily. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d If this was one of the Broken technicians...<br>", " <br>", "Only the soft growl of static on a flickering, broken screen answered her and, for the briefest moment before she angrily dispelled the thought, Trion wondered if there was something to the nonsense some of the other crew members had been saying. Instead, her lips twisted back and she snorted, turning on her heel and resolving to find the idiot who had been playing games with her.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>I </i>hate<i> you.</i><br>", " <br>", "<b><b>Interlude:</b> <b>Encounter 001 [Confirmed Incident]</b></b><br>", " <br>", "This was impossible. It couldn\u2019t be happening.<br>", " <br>", "Group Leader Prime Asek Grem Liev Kurz held onto the railings of his command pulpit so tightly his hands ached, wanting to scream in denial of what he was seeing. His ship, the scout cruiser <i>Curse of Prophecy</i>, rolled lazily through space, utterly crippled and unable to do anything... anything but watch.<br>", " <br>", "It was luck that had saved Asek and his ship, nothing more. The human vessel \u2013 for only one had fired \u2013 had launched on Expansion Fleet Bankala from impossible range with a terrifying new weapon. Missiles that were not missiles, but something he could not fathom. Railcannon rounds that arced and curved through space. Guided by tracking systems of a power Asek couldn\u2019t conceive of, the fleet\u2019s jamming had been useless against them. Four ships had died in that first salvo, another two when the weapons that had missed came back on a second attack run. Another seven had perished before the humans closed to missile range \u2013 a fifth of the fleet gone and for nothing!<br>", " <br>", "He supposed he should have been grateful. As such a small capital ship, it would have been <i>Curse of Prophecy</i>\u2019s duty to place itself between those warheads and their larger, more vital targets. Instead, Asek and his vessel had been ordered to range ahead of Expansion Fleet Bankala to locate any potential human scouts or observers. Although <i>Curse of Prophecy</i> or any of the scouting ships assigned to the Expansion Fleet could have carried the information the Fleet carried, the risk of a single ship being intercepted was too great and courier drones were too new, too unreliable to trust with this information. The fleet would move as one in this. The humans\u2019 homeworld <i>must</i> fall. Nothing could be left to chance. That had been the plan, at least. Fortune had surprised them all and none more than <i>Curse of Prophecy</i>.<br>", " <br>", "They had been approaching the shock limit when a pair of human destroyers had dropped in on them. It was an act of unmitigated insanity; even a Compact ship had no business attempting to shock this far from the safe limit. The humans had been desperate to weave their nets though. Even more galling; they had succeeded. But if there was one thing about humans, it was that they took what any civilized being called insanity and made it work.<br>", " <br>", "By the Black\u2019s own luck, the destroyers shocked in at point-blank range, both sides caught by surprise. Indeed; one of the humans was so close to <i>Curse of Prophecy</i> that the crew of either ship could have read each other\u2019s names off the hull,. Fortune\u2019s twisted mercy at work; the two ships had all but collided, their screens brushing against each other. The interplay of such devastating energies had utterly destroyed the human ship while <i>Curse of Prophecy</i> was \u2018merely\u2019 reduced to a wreck.<br>", " <br>", "Even as he\u2019d rolled the ship, the second human vessel had fired into the weakened cruiser. At such short range even human weapons could be deadly and whatever had not been devastated by the near-miss was quickly reduced to rubble by the destroyer\u2019s broadsides. <i>Curse of Prophecy</i> had had but a single battery able to target its foe, but that was enough. They destroyed the alien vessel before it could alert its comrades to <i>Prophecy</i>\u2019s presence, but not before the destroyer vomited out a belly of their damned abominate machines. The drones dispersed, no longer seeing the hulked scout cruiser as a threat.<br>", " <br>", "Asek wished he could have argued with such an assessment, but it was true; his ship was all but dead. Given enough time, they might be able to make one or two shocks but the stress of the maneuver would split the stricken vessel apart.<br>", " <br>", "Weapons were down. Life support was barely functional. Sublight engines were a memory. Communications were intermittent; he could receive, but not transmit and what he was hearing made his heart ache. Bastion Leader Bankala was calling for support. His ship, the <i>Bringer of Light</i>, was burning.<br>", " <br>", "A Triarch\u2019s Chariot was <i>aflame</i>.<br>", " <br>", "The human warship was chasing <i>Bringer of Light</i>. A Chariot forced to flee... it was inconceivable. Both giants were tearing gouges in each other, plasma fires coring through their hulls, both of them dying together. The few remaining vessels of Expansion Fleet Bankala were abandoning their own engagements and rushing to <i>Bringer of Light</i>\u2019s aid, hounded every step by the surviving humans. The animals had gone insane, throwing their own ships into the path of Compact guns or even into the ships themselves. Asek dug his fingernails painfully into his palm as he watched the battlecruiser <i>Divine Ruination</i> explode, rammed by a human kamikaze. \u201cMadness,\u201d he whispered. \u201cMadness.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Two hundred of their ships lay dead and yet they still kept coming \u2013 why hadn\u2019t they broken? Every other human fleet had at least <i>attempted</i> to flee long before this point. They acted as if this Bankala\u2019s force <i>must</i> be destroyed...<br>", " <br>", "They knew. Somehow they knew that <i>Farseeing Strike</i> had divined their homeworld\u2019s location and that Bankala ran to alert the rest of the Expansion Force. \u201cRun,\u201d Asek said softly, though he knew it was impossible for the humans to hear them and that they would not listen even if they could. \u201cYou have to run.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The destroyer <i>Pulpit of Truth</i> broke apart as a human cruiser harried it to destruction, the infidels\u2019 vessel dying a moment later to the guns of <i>Thunderous Declamation</i>. The heavy cruiser\u2019s victory lasted little longer than that of the humans as it was almost negligently swatted by the infidel Chariot. <i>Bringer of Light</i> was attempting to pull away, to reach the safety of the nearest shock point and flee beyond the human\u2019s reach, but the Chariot\u2019s acceleration was dropping steadily as the human beast poured salvo upon salvo into its engines.<br>", " <br>", "The Group Leader wanted to scream, to curse and rail at his engineers to get his broken ship back into the fight, but that was impossible. He was watching a Triarch die and all he could do was hope that the human monstrosity died first. \u201cRun,\u201d he beseeched the humans again. \u201cRun.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "<i>Please.</i><br>", " <br>", "An electronic screech rippled through the open comm lines as <i>Benediction of Flame</i> turned its guns on every nearby Compact vessel, crippled and dead alike. The betrayal lasted only seconds, the battlecruiser shattering as its missile doors slammed shut and armed warheads detonated inside it. Before the ship died, Asek knew he had heard Group Leader Demur screaming as her own vessel turned against her.<br>", " <br>", "As the last remnants of the human fleet slaughtered the surviving vessels of Expansion Fleet Bankala, Asek found his attention fixed on the duel between gods. <i>Bringer of Light</i> was running in earnest now, desperate to escape the ravening beast at its heels. They lashed one another with fires that could scourge planets and Asek wept to see a Chariot brought so low. It was shameful, but he was not alone. In that moment, he would have given anything to see the humans break contact. He would have ended the war, given them their lives, their worlds \u2013 anything. Just so that they would <i>stop</i>. So that <i>Bringer of Light</i> would live. That the Triarch would live.<br>", " <br>", "The human vessel was savaged every bit as fiercely as the Chariot, but it kept after its prey. It was an impossible thing. It should not have existed. The human warships were weak, pathetic things. How had they built this... this abomination? How had they done this?<br>", " <br>", "The fleets were dead now, only <i>Bringer of Light</i> and the abomination remained. The human ship was falling behind, its sublight drive severely damaged. As its weapons began to lose range, the Chariot\u2019s own screens grew stronger. In minutes, they would have grown from tattered shards to nigh-impenetrable barriers and the humans no longer had the power to batter them down as they did before. Still, the heretics lashed and tore at the Chariot, but their blows grew feebler as the range opened. It would not be enough, not to end a Triarch\u2019s Chariot.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d whispered Asek. <i>Bringer of Light</i> would survive. His Triarch would live. \u201cYes.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cPrime!\u201d Pack Leader Thun\u2019s voice raised. \u201cSomething is happening with the enemy vessel.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Was it breaking up? Had the humans lost containment of their own power core? Asek let hope rise for a moment, only to feel it turn stale and bitter as he looked over the junior officer\u2019s readings. That was... That couldn\u2019t... that made no sense. \u201cWhat is this...?\u201d he whispered, trying to decipher what it was he was seeing. A sudden dread clutched at his gut and he lifted his gaze to the main screen. \u201cShow it to me!\u201d he shouted. \u201cShow me what they\u2019re doing!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The range was too far for the crippled <i>Curse of Prophecy</i>\u2019s own sensors, but there were still one or two functional recon drones that the scout cruiser was receiving data from. Through them, Asek saw it all.<br>", " <br>", "He saw the melted, broken and ruined hull plates of the human chariot\u2019s prow shudder open. He saw the impossible, writhing flux arcs of energy spasming along the vessel\u2019s length as some unspeakable siege weapon charged, saw the renewed assault as <i>Bringer of Light</i> threw what weapons it could bring to bear in a final, desperate bid to kill the human chariot and he saw how futile it was. He heard it; <i>Bringer of Light</i>\u2019s final transmission, a single word squealing through all the static and battle damage.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cImpossible.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Reality <i>screamed</i>; there was no other word for it. It shrieked as it was torn open, lacerated and split like rotten fruit. <i>Un</i>light writhed in a hellish aurora that consumed <i>Bringer of Light</i>. Screens meant nothing. Hull plates deformed as stresses they were never meant to experience ruined them. Asek could only imagine the cries of the Chariot\u2019s crew as they were consumed by the balefire. <i>Bringer of Light</i> shattered, breaking like a toy snapped over a petulant child\u2019s knee, vomiting atmosphere and pieces of itself from the two halves of its body.<br>", " <br>", "Forced to bear witness, Asek struggled to hold himself in check. It was not until his mind caught up with what he was seeing that he lost control. <i>Curse of Prophecy</i> had been near the edge of the system; the Expansion Fleet had still been many hours from the shock limit. He wasn\u2019t watching what was <i>happening</i>. He was seeing what had already <i>happened</i>. <i>Bringer of Light</i> was dead. Bastion Leader Bankala was dead. A Triarch was dead.<br>", " <br>", "Confronted with this realization, Asek looked with new horror upon the images, knowing that he had watched one of his gods die for the second time this day and as its its killer slipped away, all he could do was scream his rage.</div>"]}

He\u2019d known Herut, had even recommended him for a promotion. He knelt next to his subordinate\u2019s butchered corpse. An amputated hand lay in front of him, the index finger marked by the tan line where Herut had worn his academy class ring when not on duty. Herut had a sister; she\u2019d have to be told. Told that her brother had died on some alien hulk and for nothing. Not even died \u2013 he\u2019d been <i>butchered</i>. No, even that was wrong. Butchery intimated some emotion, some driving savagery.<br>", " <br>", "The machines had simply... <i>disassembled</i> Herut, utterly and completely. The stench of blood and viscera was thick in the faithful\u2019s nostrils, with the reek of human vomit growing stronger as the one Broken made disgusting <i>huk-huk</i> sounds, retching her guts up onto the deck. The engineer stood, turning to look at the nearby convert, the Janissary\u2019s carbine still held in a ready grip.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cGet them out of here,\u201d Trenis said to the soldier. As the convert herded the assembled engineers away, the engineer strode towards the small form doubled over on the floor.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>They... they...</i> For Grace, it was still playing over and over in her mind\u2019s eye. The swarm of robots crawling over her. The blood-soaked horde dismembering the epigone, cutting him to ribbons with the same tools they\u2019d used to help her. Her order to the convert, telling him to hold his fire.<br>", " <br>", "<i>They...</i> She couldn\u2019t get past that thought, her brain stuck in a loop as she tried to process what had happened. What she\u2019d let happen. He\u2019d died.<br>", " <br>", "<i>He was already dead,</i> a voice whispered from the back of her mind. <i>He was already dead and you know it. There was no saving him, only saving everyone else.</i> \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered furiously. \u201cNo.\u201d <i>I could have... I could have... before they-they...</i><br>", " <br>", "Grace was still on her hands and knees when she was lifted off the ground, a massive fist closing around her throat. \u201cYou,\u201d Faithful Trenis said, his voice thick with anger. \u201cLet him die.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Hanging in the air like a child, Grace\u2019s legs kicked feebly at nothing. She gasped for breath, adrenalin breaking her out of her fugue. \u201cYes,\u201d she gasped. \u201cI had to.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou told the convert not to fire,\u201d Trenis didn\u2019t loosen his grip. \u201cI want to know why.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace\u2019s vision was starting to dim as she tried to suck in air through her constricted throat. She didn\u2019t have enough air left to speak and could only make incoherent sounds, pointing to her throat. After a moment, Trenis loosened his grip, but did not let her down. \u201cExplain yourself,\u201d he demanded.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThey-they would have killed us all,\u201d Grace replied, gulping in a lungful of air.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAnd how do you know this?\u201d Trenis demanded, his voice rising.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBe-because they didn\u2019t kill me.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat?\u201d the faithful snapped, pulling Grace closer. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The words flew out of her in a rush. Her encounter in the maintenance tunnel, how she hadn\u2019t been harmed. \u201cHerut must-must have done something to trigger an-an attack response,\u201d she said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t hurt me. They didn\u2019t attack anyone else. J-just him. I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know what triggered it. It could have been an ac-accident.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Trenis stared at Grace for a long moment, his expression turning thoughtful. Suspicious, but thoughtful. Finally, he released the human, dropping her unceremoniously to the deck. Grace massaged her bruised throat, gasping as the ship\u2019s stale air flooded her lungs. Trenis ignored her. Without any further comment, the Tribune turned to leave, only to freeze before he\u2019d taken a full step.<br>", " <br>", "Allyria was standing there. Her cyclic cannon was holstered on her back, but she wasn\u2019t unarmed. On her left thigh, Allyria had a combat knife. Although small in the Verrish\u2019s hands, to a human it would be closer to a gladius or short sword. Allyria\u2019s fingers were wrapped around the hilt and there was the barest gleam of metal from the half-drawn blade. \u201cSectator Proctor,\u201d the Verrish said quietly. \u201cI think you should return to the reactor bay. I\u2019m certain Sectator Kilgrave and Pack Leader Nasham will want a statement from you.\u201d Her voice was flat and clicked through her helmet\u2019s speakers.<br>", " <br>", "Grace looked from her friend to Trenis; she opened her mouth, then closed it.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Allyria said, though she never moved, never looked away from Trenis. \u201cI\u2019m just going to secure the area.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace swallowed painfully. The taste of bile filled her mouth, her aching throat stung with acid and she knew she\u2019d been crying. She didn\u2019t know whether it was from what she\u2019d seen or when Trenis had had a hold of her. She climbed to her feet, wanting to say something \u2013 anything \u2013 to Allyria, but she knew that there wasn\u2019t anything she <i>could</i> say, especially not in front of the faithful. Instead, she brushed against the Verrish woman, whispering a single word. \u201cPlease.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Allyria didn\u2019t move, waiting until Grace was out of earshot before she spoke. \u201cYou wanted an explanation,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019re not entitled to one. She\u2019s an officer. You\u2019re a noncom.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Trenis barked a laugh. \u201cShe\u2019s no more an officer than you are, Brute. A Broken in an officer\u2019s uniform is a bad joke, like a... pig taught to sing.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Verrish said nothing for a moment, her face hidden behind her helmet, her posture just as no more revealing, although her fingers twitched. At last, she slid her knife back into its sheath. \u201cReturn to your duties, faithful. My team will sweep the area.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Without bothering to acknowledge the order, Trenis strode away, but he had taken only a few paces when Allyria spoke again. \u201cFaithful Trenis Comt. Engineering. Aldev shift.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The engineer\u2019s face twisted in a scowl, his upper eyes narrowing. \u201cYes.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Verrish tilted her helmet towards the Tribune, a fractional nod. \u201cYes.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>She screams.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>She screams as the Scarabs swarm over her, thrashing and flailing as they cut and cut and cut again, a roiling, shining, skittering tide of obsidian machines that swarm through the corridors, eating their own dead and building them anew. He hears the thudding footsteps of a Spider as it strides through the horde, the shivering giggles of Stalkers and the shrills of their weapons.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>He\u2019s screaming too as his men drag him away, calling her name even as the shapeless mound that used to be a woman grows smaller and smaller, until there\u2019s nothing left but the swarming tide.</i><br>", " <br>", "Nasham swallowed a handful of pills, desperately gulping them down. \u201cMachines,\u201d he said at last.<br>", " <br>", "Faithful Trenis nodded. \u201cYes, patron. They appear to be-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201c-service devices, but once provoked, they react with violence.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The engineer blinked both sets of eyes. \u201cYes, patron. How did you know?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham\u2019s only response was a haunted-eyed smile.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Group Leader Usul considered the reports before him. Two casualties to date, but the teams were working their way through the wreck. He tapped his fingers against polished <i>silba</i> wood surface of his desk. Usul closed his upper eyes in thought. Pack Leader Nasham was pushing rather stridently for regional command to be notified. The group leader had never considered the pack leader to be alarmist, but there was a certain displeasing tone in his reports. Nothing panicked or hysterical, but there was definitely an edge to his writing.<br>", " <br>", "Usul knew that Nasham had been damaged goods, although he\u2019d never been able to find out precisely what had happened to him that had resulted in his discommendation. Once, Nasham had been a promising officer on the fast track to his own command in the expansion fleets. Now, he was doomed to remain a junior officer for the rest of his career. If by some miracle he earned himself a higher rank, it would only be behind a desk. The fate of a pill-popping failure who\u2019d been shunted off to a human-infested backwater.<br>", " <br>", "<i>That will not be me,</i> Usul thought, glaring at Nasham\u2019s report as if it were the man himself. <i>I will not live out my career on this pathetic ship surrounded by Broken.</i> He leaned back, calling up the information sent back by the first teams. It was fragmentary and incomplete, but they had only been aboard the derelict for less than two days. Still, the preliminary analysis of the reactor they\u2019d located was enough to make his engineers drool with envy. Whatever species had built this ship, they had been most advanced. So much could be garnered from this rotting husk, more than enough to propel him away from Rally, perhaps even to a command within the expansion fleets themselves. To seek out new worlds and bring them into the fold, to spread the Compact\u2019s banner across the stars and earn accolades and honours... yes. To do all that, he needed leverage. Something to his name more than teaching Broken what buttons to push.<br>", " <br>", "Usul paused, tapping his chin in thought. His teams were established on the vessel. He could send his courier to Column Leader Seyr now; there was no way Seyr could deny him his rightful due, not with what he\u2019d already found. Although... there was still much to learn from this ship and his teams had not run into any problems. Any <i>major</i> problems, at least. The deaths were unfortunate, but the decks were hardly running red with blood.<br>", " <br>", "It would be... premature to abandon their efforts now. Besides, even the humans seemed to be making decent headway in their repairs. He hardly needed Seyr and a corps of engineers traipsing about the derelict. Yes, he would report this to local command, as his duty dictated. But not just yet. Not until he had more than a single reactor in his hands.<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune stood, looking out the window at the savage brilliance of Terrahope and the distant speck obscured by its light. \u201cYes,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou are mine.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Grace flinched as she heard one of the small robots skitter through the ceiling, just over her head. She was working alone again; this time, she was attempting to track down one of the missing probes. They continued to go off-line. A handful had been recovered \u2013 there\u2019d been no physical damage, but they\u2019d been completely shut down, their systems overloaded, disrupted or outright drained. A handful had been found simply hovering in place. Those had clearly malfunctioned \u2013 nothing at all was wrong with them, but they had simply stopped working. The engineers assigned to drone control were fuming over the \u201cunacceptable rate of failure\u201d.<br>", " <br>", "The young woman shone her flashlight across the corridor. Every so often there\u2019d be a stuttering light panel, but this part of the ship hadn\u2019t yet been re-connected to the reactor\u2019s grid. The cone of light ghosted along the walls, occasionally highlighting more of the alien script, blacked-out computer panels or closed doors.<br>", " <br>", "She could hear noises. The clicking of the insectoid machines\u2019 feet, the clang and thud of shifting debris. Distant echoes of voices. The comm still spat static and what she swore sounded disturbingly like voices and laughter. More than once she\u2019d turned, expecting to see something behind her, only to find nothing. The ship made her skin crawl. It felt... it felt wrong somehow. She wanted to believe that that was just her nerves speaking but she wasn\u2019t so sure.<br>", " <br>", "<i>We should never have come here,</i> Grace thought. Two people were dead already \u2013 two <i>Tribunes</i> \u2013 and one of them was her fault. If she\u2019d been faster with the repairs. If she\u2019d managed to tell Kilgrave about the machines. There must have been something... and she\u2019d failed to do it. She didn\u2019t know what that could be, only that there had to have been <i>something</i>.<br>", " <br>", "That was why she was on this detail, away from the other personnel. Like Harker, she was now marked. Even Kilgrave had been uncharacteristically subdued when he\u2019d given her this assignment. He just wanted her as far from him as possible.<br>", " <br>", "It was unfair, unreasonable. <i>You couldn\u2019t have done anything for him,</i> an inner voice insisted. <i>But you saved everyone else and </i>this<i> is how you get treated? Like a pariah?</i><br>", " <br>", "Grace shook her head in denial. \u201cNo,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cThere could have been... I might have...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "<i>There wasn\u2019t. You know that.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Shut up.</i> \u201cShut up,\u201d Grace repeated the words aloud to herself, squeezing her eyes shut for a moment. \u201cJust... shut up.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "In the silence that followed, the young woman continued her search, treading deeper through the catacombs and wondering, not for the first or even the last time, about the answer to Allyria\u2019s question.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Renan was on one knee before the Triarch, the Bastion Leader\u2019s head bowed in contrition. \u201cWe have scoured the system,\u201d he reported. \u201cThere is no trace of the Wound and nothing that can garner us a indication of where it has gone.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOf course not,\u201d the Triarch said. \u201cSo tell me, Bastion Leader \u2013 what shall we do now?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Renan still did not look up. He knew this question was coming, but he had no answer for it. The Wound could be less than a light-year away, or it could be thousands. When it worked, the Wound\u2019s shock drive could surpass even present-day Compact capabilities. When it did not... even the finest instrumentation was useless in plotting its course. That one facet of the creature had never changed; Bankala\u2019s legacy. \u201cIt is wounded,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cPattern analysis indicates that it will slink away rather than continue its raids. My strategists are already plotting the most likely systems that it will seek succor.\u201d <i>Providing its drive did not misfire and render all their projections useless.</i> \u201cWe will dispatch scouts to investigate and continue searching until we find it again.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI admire your dedication to such fruitless endeavours,\u201d the Triarch replied. It gestured dismissively. \u201cDispatch your scouts, Bastion Leader. I eagerly await your findings.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Renan bowed in obeisance. \u201cYes, Triarch.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "After the doors closed behind him, the Triarch laced its spindly fingers together. \u201cWords,\u201d it said. \u201cAlways, I am offered only words.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWell, what do you expect?\u201d a voice said in answer. \u201cYou want to destroy <i>Nemesis</i>, but you don\u2019t want anyone to know that you\u2019re doing it. You feed fleets to it piecemeal. You cut it over and over, but it always comes back. You underestimate your opponent time and again and you wonder why those who survive it offer only failure to you.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Triarch chuckled, finding the insolence in the newcomer\u2019s tone amusing. \u201cI take it that you do not care for the Bastion Leader\u2019s plan.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "A diminutive shape moved, emerging from the shadows. Even the Triarch\u2019s dark-adapted eyes had not been able to pick it out. There was no sound to its movement, no soft rasp of air through lungs or beating of a heart. There was no scent to it. A void, dead to the senses until it chose to reveal itself. Perfect white teeth gleamed as red lips split in a smile. \u201cI think if that strategy worked, you wouldn\u2019t have spent two thousand years fighting her.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "A displeased rattle of air wisped through the Triarch\u2019s teeth. Melodic laughter came from the apparition. \u201c\u2018It\u2019, of course. My apologies.\u201d The smile widened. \u201cYou personify machines, denoting them as \u2018beasts\u2019, \u2018animals\u2019 and \u2018creatures\u2019, but you shy away from fully anthropomorphizing them. I\u2019ve always found that dichotomy interesting.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Triarch ignored the comment. \u201cYour thoughts on Renan\u2019s \u2018strategy\u2019?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cA man can try and empty an ocean with a bucket, but it doesn\u2019t make it a good idea. Unfortunately for Bastion Leader Renan, all he\u2019s got is a bucket.\u201d The figure moved towards the room\u2019s ornate holo display, a curt gesture activating it. The wireframe image of a bulk freighter appeared in gleaming red lines, serial numbers, ship specifications and history above it. \u201cDo you remember <i>Dutiful Burden</i>?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Triarch leaned forward, a spark of interest in its black eyes, its tongue licking over its teeth. \u201cYou have something.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI have a few theories. Nothing I want to commit to yet. I need more data. But what I\u2019m thinking is this...\u201d a dead woman\u2019s face smiled even wider than before. \u201c...she doesn\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d</div>"]}

The first odour she recognized was Grace\u2019s and the Verrish relaxed a little at the comforting scent. The next was Tribune, which completely cancelled out the calming effect of her friend\u2019s presence. Other human scents filtered in and the young woman\u2019s tongue flicked out from between her teeth. The rattle of human language \u2013 or, rather their dialect of Common \u2013 filled the air, punctuated by the deeper voices of the Tribunes.<br>", " <br>", "Beside her, Grace lifted herself off her cot, turning to look at Allyria. Her eyes widened a fraction just before a heavy boot placed itself on the Verrish\u2019s back and pushed, knocking her off her own cot.

Once Uday decided to lift the quarantine, Nasham would return to <i>Bequeathed</i> to have his dosage increased. Perhaps then he\u2019d find some rest. Perhaps he\u2019d even forget.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Kilgrave was smiling as he knelt beside the open maintenance tube. \u201cScans show that there\u2019s a broken conduit section in there, initiate. Get in and fix it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace\u2019s jaw tightened but she didn\u2019t say anything. There were others in his unit that were more adept engineers, but it wasn\u2019t her technical skill that Kilgrave wanted. The sectator was always a lot braver when Allyria wasn\u2019t around. She knew she should say something herself, but Kilgrave was one of the faces that every human on Rally knew. A sanctioned officer, decorated for his heroism under fire and considered reliable enough to oversee weapons batteries. She was only a trainee who hadn\u2019t yet graduated from the Academy.<br>", " <br>", "Trying to ignore the smirk on Kilgrave\u2019s face, Grace got on all fours. As she started to crawl into the open accessway, Kilgrave grabbed her and leaned in close. \u201cYou keep an eye on your Brute, Proctor. People are talking.\u201d Grace looked up, surprised. The flourishing sense of camaraderie vanished when Kilgrave laughed. \u201cMake sure you put velvet tongue of yours to work.\u201d Grace felt her cheeks flush angrily and she continued into the maintenance shaft.<br>", " <br>", "The rad counter on her EVA suit clicked with increasing frequency as she approached the source of the damage. Grace saw why; there was a hole blown straight through the crawlspace. It was no bigger than a meter around, the result of a penetrating hit from some kind of energy weapon. Peering over the ragged lip of the breach, Grace could see the damaged power conduit. It had been almost sheared clean through by the beam. No wonder power was interrupted. The young woman bit her lip. This was going to require a lot more work than she\u2019d thought.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThe conduit is severely damaged,\u201d she radioed. \u201cI\u2019m going to need some assistance here.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHandle it yourself,\u201d Kilgrave snapped. \u201cWe\u2019re short-handed here, you know.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI know, but I\u2019m also getting radiation warnings-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThen you\u2019d better work <i>fast</i>,\u201d the chief interrupted. \u201cDon\u2019t give me excuses, initiate.

Until then, don\u2019t come out until you\u2019re in the red. Got it?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace gritted her teeth. \u201cUnderstood, patron.\u201d No, Robert KIilgrave wasn\u2019t like his \u2018vid appearances at all.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>Sound and light.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>I haven\u2019t done much with the latter, but the former is easy enough. Infrasonic and ultrasonic cascades, emitted outside the range of human or Tribune hearing and buried in the background noise.

She was all thumbs with tools and this was a job for at least two people. She\u2019d never been particularly claustrophobic and the accessway wasn\u2019t <i>that</i> tight, but the pervasive darkness and the constant ticking of her rad counter weren\u2019t helping.<br>", " <br>", "She swore as she dropped another tool; this time it was the coupler she needed to fix part of the bypass\u2019s bracket to the conduit. The coupler fell out of the breach in the tunnel and Grace had to lean through the hole to pick it back up, trying to hold the bracket in place with her other hand. It popped free, undoing the last few minutes\u2019 work.<br>", " <br>", "The young woman closed her eyes and counted to ten. It didn\u2019t help. She wanted to shout, to swear and curse and demand Kilgrave actually put someone on this who knew what they were doing. It was ridiculous. She was training to be a bridge officer, not an engineer...! She sighed, abandoning that line of thought. She was doing the same cross-training regime that all prospective officers went through. It was the best way to determine their specializations. Still, knowing that didn\u2019t make her frustration any less severe. She tried to recall some of the meditative phrases that Yurim and the other confessors had taught the students. <i>Service is peace. Obedience brings clarity...</i> They never worked for her like they did for her classmates. Every time she tried to use them, she only ever heard them in Allyria\u2019s voice, an undercurrent of sarcasm running through each word.<br>", " <br>", "Sighing, Grace tried to wedge the brace back in place. She\u2019d never understood Allyria\u2019s hostility towards the Compact. She\u2019d learned to tolerate it, but the Verrisha\u2019s anger was a completely foreign concept to her. The Compact had always been good to Rally; they\u2019d saved the human race from extinction after the Calamity. She remembered her history; Rally had been founded by a convoy that had fled the disaster that had destroyed Earth. A handful of primitive ships, barely shock-capable. The only survivors of a doomed world. They had found Rally by chance and believed it a paradise. They\u2019d been wrong.<br>", " <br>", "Less than a generation after planetfall, Rally had been savaged by asteroid impacts. A third of the population died outright and a quarter of the remainder starved or succumbed to disease with the collapse of the infrastructure they\u2019d established. Humanity had been a hair\u2019s breadth from dying out completely until the arrival of the Compact.<br>", " <br>", "Rally had been located by a scientific mission \u2013 Exploration Fleet 9737, sent out beyond the Compact\u2019s borders to chart and survey virgin territory. The expedition director had been astonished to find a human population on Rally; without the aid he had rendered, they might have descended into barbarism entirely or simply gone extinct. That scientific mission had been the beginning of humanity\u2019s partnership with the Compact.<br>", " <br>", "Today, Rally was still far from the Compact\u2019s nominal borders and the older, more civilized worlds of its members (although once the Seventh Expansion was complete, that would change), it was a hub for scientists, deep-range traders and fortune-seekers. Slowly but surely, humanity was coming into their own, with the help and guidance of the Compact. Grace couldn\u2019t imagine a universe in which humanity had never encountered the Compact; the Triarchs and their fellow elite had done so much for Rally, more than humanity could ever repay.<br>", " <br>", "Likewise, Grace had heard that the Compact was currently engaged in massive reconstruction efforts on the Verrisha homeworld, striving to repair the damage caused by some terrible catastrophe. It was the way of young species to endanger themselves. They lacked the foresight, the clarity that older races possessed and when they made a misstep or suffered some ill fortune, the Compact selflessly pulled them back from the brink.<br>", " <br>", "That was what the Compact did \u2013 they found species throughout the galaxy and helped them, raising them up to civilization. Humanity would one day earn their place as full citizens, just as Grace was sure that the Verrisha would, too. No, Grace didn\u2019t understand why Allyria seemed so... resentful of the Tribunes. Certainly, they\u2019d been the saviours of humanity and she only ever heard reports about the tireless work the Compact was doing on the Verrisha homeworld and with the other protectorate races.<br>", " <br>", "Grace frowned, distracted from her thoughts by a sudden rapid clicking. She checked her radiation gauge, afraid that something had happened to exacerbate the spillage, but it was still reading the same rate of exposure as it had before. Then what was...?<br>", " <br>", "The thought ended as she caught movement out of the corner of her eye. Something small blurred through her vision, landing atop the damaged power conduit. With a startled cry, Grace fell back, staring at the newly-arrived thing.<br>", " <br>", "It was about the size of her hand. Insectoid in form, it was like a beetle with its glossy black exoskeleton and many-jointed legs tucked up under its body. Mechanical, a cluster of sensor bulbs gave it a cyclopean appearance, small status lights gleaming from with the crevices of its body and along its back. Beneath its blunt nose was a cluster of delicate probes and tools. It stared at her, unmoving for a moment before delicately climbing over the conduit, a small scanner shining over the damaged sections and her own attempts to bypass them.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cUhm,\u201d Grace licked her lips, unsure of what to say. An atavistic part of her told her to crawl as fast as she could, but she forced that impulse aside. \u201cHello,\u201d she said, wondering if the small automaton could even understand her. It lifted itself up onto its four hind legs, its forward pair of appendages reaching out to her. It made a sound, but Grace had no idea what it meant \u2013 if it was actually a language, or some type of machine code.<br>", " <br>", "The device repeated the sound and when no response was forthcoming, leapt onto Grace. She yelped, about to try and pull it off, but it was too fast and scurried up her arm to her faceplate. Its head tilted to stare at her through the clear helm. Grace watched its many tools moving for a moment before they stilled. The device dropped to the deck and raised itself up, emitting a shrill screech. It was so loud that it was painful even through the autodampeners in Grace\u2019s helmet and the young woman clapped her hands to the sides of her head.<br>", " <br>", "After what seemed like an age, the machine quieted and scurried back to the damaged conduit. \u201cWhat was that...\u201d Grace began, but the words died in her throat as she heard skittering from all around her. Dozens \u2013 hundreds \u2013 of tiny feet scrabbled over metal, crawling through walls and access tunnels, clinking through pipes and vents. They were all around her.<br>", " <br>", "Another of the machines dropped down right in her lap. Before she could reach down and try to toss it away, another climbed over the lip of the hole. Another appeared. And then another. Another. They fell from above, crawled up from below, skittering over her. It was not her proudest moment, but Grace couldn\u2019t help but whimper in fear as the machines swarmed over her, wanting to scream, to run, to grab them and throw them away, but she was paralyzed.<br>", " <br>", "As the horde continued to clamber harmlessly over her, she realized that whatever this was, it wasn\u2019t an attack. The beetle-things weren\u2019t hurting her. They were just trying to get past her. With a sudden sense of realization, she turned around. The hole behind her, the source of the radiation leak \u2013 half of the swarm was headed into the breached chamber while the other half... she watched in amazement as one anchored itself to the open lip of the breach, more following suit. Others attached themselves to those. In moments, their bodies had formed a wall between her and the radiation source. It wasn\u2019t perfect shielding, like the walls around the reactor but it was enough that she saw her gauge dip slightly. Turning back to the conduit, Grace saw that four of the machines remained there, climbing over it and her own work. They weren\u2019t just observing it \u2013 they were studying. Analyzing.<br>", " <br>", "Her fear forgotten, Grace climbed towards the small machines. Self-directed repair units. <i>Incredible.</i> \u201cAre you going to help me?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs that it?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "As in it answer, one of the little drones seized the bypass, its own miniature couplers sparking to life.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cFigured you\u2019d get it done,\u201d Kilgrave smiled as Grace pulled herself out of the tunnel. \u201cAll you needed was the right motivation.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The provisional sectator chose to ignore her superior\u2019s attempt at humour. \u201cI had some help.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Kilgrave blinked, confused. \u201cWhat help?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace opened her mouth, but her answer was cut off as somebody screamed.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Epigone Herut Trilk cursed as he again attempted to override the door controls and again met with failure. He was elbow deep in a wall panel, trying to get this Triarch-damned mechanism to work. Someone had welded the manual overrides shut, just like had been done to the doors in the landing bay... and several other sites besides. Whoever had done so had obviously wanted to isolate themselves from the rest of the ship. Herut was no Janissary, but it seemed to him that no one could have done this without trapping themselves between each set of sealed doors; they must have attempted to seal each section in turn before being overrun. But that didn\u2019t make sense; not all the doors were shut in this manner. It only turned this warren of decks and bulkheads into a maze. Perhaps it was intended to set up more choke-points, funneling an attacker through chosen corridors?<br>", " <br>", "If that were the case, shouldn\u2019t there be some evidence of a battle? Spent shell casings, bodies, broken barricades? There none of those these things here. It didn\u2019t make any sense. Nothing about this ship did.<br>", " <br>", "It was ancient, but there was no trace of it or the race that had made it in <i>Bequeathed</i>\u2019s database. No one had ever heard of it, but there was that warning in Common. The ship had been boarded before, but there was no trace of crew or visitors. Contradiction after contradiction. What had happened here?<br>", " <br>", "Herut cursed as he pulled on the manual override. The doors yawned open... and then, just as had been happening doing for the last half an hour, the panel he\u2019d been working on flashed red and the doors slammed shut. The epigone swore again. There was a short in the circuit; every time he opened the door, some protocol kicked in and shut it again. He\u2019d all but eviscerated the control panel trying to find some hardware flaw. If it was a software issue, then there was nothing he could do; he wasn\u2019t a computer technician, even if he could understand an alien operating system.<br>", " <br>", "The epigone reached back up into the guts of the panel, the cam-probes he\u2019d put in there feeding onto his HUD. Everything <i>looked</i> like it was fixed or bypassed. So what was the issue? Why couldn\u2019t he get this blasted door to stay open?<br>", " <br>", "Wait. There, on that breaker... he\u2019d fixed that. He was sure of it. In fact, the damage didn\u2019t even look like he remembered. Growling angrily, the Tribune spent several minutes fixing the flaw. There. That should do it. He reached for the override and slammed it back. The doors snapped open... and then slammed shut.<br>", " <br>", "It took a great deal of effort for Herut not to scream in frustration, but he paused. He\u2019d left the cam feed on this time. Had he seen...? He backtracked the view. Yes. There it was. Some kind of energy discharge cutting into the breaker again. It had come from...<br>", " <br>", "Herut all but lunged into open panel, reaching up into the farthest reaches. His fingers closed around something foreign and wiggling and he pulled it out. It was some kind of robotic insect, many legs twitching furiously in his grasp. Herut roared in agony as it slashed him, a cutting laser burning through his armoured gloves and deep into his hand. He dropped the machine and, furious, smashed it under one heavy boot. He probably shouldn\u2019t have done that; Trenis would take a strip off his hide for it, but by the Black Thrones, that <i>hurt</i>! The Tribune cradled his injured hand, tears welling up in all four eyes from the pain. He gingerly tugged his glove off, wincing as he did so.<br>", " <br>", "Triarchs, that <i>was</i> deep. It had almost cut all the way through his palm. Almost all the tendons had been severed; he couldn\u2019t even move his fingers. \u201cEpigone Herut to Faithful Trenis,\u201d he said into the comm. \u201cI-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "He paused as he recognized a new sound. It was like... rustling. Skittering.<br>", " <br>", "It was coming from all around him, and it was getting closer.<br>", " <br>", "\u201c...I may have a situation here,\u201d he finished.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>The technicians are updated versions of the CIGR-7730 Service Unit.

Most Confederate ships possessed at least one \u2018hive\u2019 of the 7730 series.

It had begun with only a few, but more and more of them had seeped out of the walls, crawling out of damaged bulkheads, skittering out of pipes and vents and clambering up from every crevice. Now they were everywhere. They leapt and ran and swarmed after him, along the floor and walls and even the ceiling. Every time one of them landed on him, if he wasn\u2019t quick enough in grabbing it off, it slashed at him with its cutting laser, dribbled acid from an internal reservoir or stabbed at him with one of its other tools.<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune flung himself against a bulkhead, dashing several of the devices to bits against it, but there were more. He staggered as a laser sliced through his spacesuit, carving deep into his thigh. He could hear the voices of his shipmates, but he didn\u2019t know what there were saying, didn\u2019t know how close they were. He didn\u2019t even know if he was heading in the right direction. The only thought pounding through his panicked brain was <i>get away, get away</i>. And so he ran.<br>", " <br>", "He felt another brilliant flare of agony from a laser\u2019s bite and then he felt a hamstring snap. He fell to the deck again, but this time he couldn\u2019t stand. They swarmed over him then, slicing and burning, hacking and spitting. He tried to pull them off, but there were too many. His armour burned and bubbled as did the flesh beneath it. Herut screamed in agony as the machines cut into him again and again and <i>again</i>. As the animals scuttled over his faceplate, he saw figures further down the corridor. He reached out to them in desperation...<br>", " <br>", "Then, one of the machines on his helm fired its laser and all he saw was black.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Grace rounded the corner, skidding to a halt amidst the crowd of people. She saw the writhing, swarming knot of drones and almost screamed when she realized what was underneath it. A hand stretched out towards her and she thought she could see the engineer\u2019s terrified eyes behind the crawling horde, but then the Tribune went limp and his body was eclipsed by the drones.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOut of the way! Out of the way!\u201d a Janissary shouted, barreling the human and engineers in his path aside, all but trampling them. His gun was raised.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo!\u201d Grace shouted, reacting without thinking. She wasn\u2019t nearly as a strong as a Tribune, but she caught him by surprise and managed to push his gun out of the way before he fired, the plasma bursts tearing into the ceiling.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cGet out of my way, Broken!\u201d the soldier roared, attempting to throw her to one side, but Grace clung to the gun\u2019s barrel, even as she was shaken like a rag doll.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d she shouted back at the Janissary. \u201cYou\u2019ll trigger their defence programming!\u201d The words were out of her mouth before she realized she\u2019d said them, or even what she was doing. \u201cIf you fire, they\u2019ll come after the rest of us.\u201d Grace took note of the rank symbols on the Janissary\u2019s armour. She took a breath. \u201cThat\u2019s an order, convert prime.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune was silent for a moment; she couldn\u2019t see his face through the blank soldier\u2019s faceplate of his helmet and was suddenly very sure that she did not want to. The moment stretched further and Grace forced herself not to look away, staring into the black visor that concealed the soldier\u2019s eyes. Finally, he lowered the weapon. \u201cUnderstood, sectator.\u201d Each syllable sounded as if he had had to force it through his lips. \u201cWhat are your orders?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace released the gun and looked back at the swarm. The lump that had been the Tribune engineer was now much smaller, a spreading pool of crimson liquid flowing out onto the deck, the machines turning red and glistening as they roiled and slid through it. \u201cNothing,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cWe do nothing.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "It was over in moments. The swirling blot of legs and carapaces broke apart, skittering back down the dark tunnel. In their wake, they left the butchered corpse of Epigone Herut Trilk, his suit and tools stripped from him.<br>", " <br>", "The young woman fell to her knees as she saw the ruined remnants of the Tribune\u2019s body. He\u2019d been taken apart literally piece by piece, carved into gobbets of flesh.

They were decompression doors \u2013 in the event of a catastrophic loss of power or damage to the bay, they slammed shut and stayed closed until power was restored. Given the state of disrepair the alien vessel was in, it was no wonder why they were currently sealed. Survey teams were scouting the upper levels of the hangar, crawling along the mezzanines and catwalks, but the doors on these levels were closed just as tight. There were manual overrides, but none of them were operational. In fact, it appeared to Grace that this was less the result of age and whatever other damages the ship had suffered than a deliberate attempt to seal the doors. Whether that was to keep something out or in, she couldn\u2019t say. She didn\u2019t mention her concerns; she wasn\u2019t a hundred percent certain and as a provisional sectator, she knew better than to voice unsupported opinions. If she could see the patterns to the damage, then surely someone else had.<br>", " <br>", "Trion had suggested that her Janissaries could cut or blast open any of the smaller doors, but Nasham had put the technicians to work hooking generators up to the main doors. If the rest of the ship was not pressurized, the doors could be closed again by cutting their power. The same could not be said for a door burnt through or blown off its hinges. Moreover, if there were indeed any crew left aboard the ship, it was hard to claim peaceful intentions when you were blasting holes in their ship.<br>", " <br>", "The ideologue had pointed out that there were already so many, who would notice one more? She did not win the argument.<br>", " <br>", "The technical teams under Faithful Trenis Comt were put to work; sections of wall plating were removed and the systems beneath were studied. The technology was unfamiliar, but similar enough to be usable. It would be hard to make a technology so idiosyncratic that merely supplying power to blast doors was impossible. Still, Trion paced angrily every moment of the delay, her annoyance rising whenever she cast a glance towards te Neu and saw how patiently the Brute waited. On the third such look, the sectator\u2019s helm raised and though she couldn\u2019t even see the Brute\u2019s eyes through its visor, Trion knew that the creature was smiling.<br>", " <br>", "As the technicians completed their connections, tapping into the power shunts that the unknown normally used to feed energy to the doors, te Neu ordered her squad forward, two of them taking position on either side of the doors, another two flanking the technicians, ready to pull them out of the way if hostile fire was incoming. Her other five soldiers took up ready positions kneeling in front of the door, te Neu herself standing behind them, where she and her cannon would have a clear line of fire over her troops\u2019 heads.<br>", " <br>", "te Neu\u2019s head tilted towards her superior. \u201cIn position, submissive.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Trion gritted her teeth so hard that her jaw ached. \u201cUnderstood, initiate.\u201d With a single curt gesture, she motioned her own team into ready positions of their own. \u201cJanissary teams await deployment, Pack Leader.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham looked to the Faithful\u2019s own technical teams. \u201cWe are ready here,\u201d Trenis confirmed as he surveyed the connections his enlisted trainees had made.<br>", " <br>", "The Pack Leader gestured for his own units to stay back. \u201cPower up,\u201d he ordered.<br>", " <br>", "The generators were small field units, but one was more than enough for both doors. The faithful nodded for the Disciple monitoring the connection. Grace knew him; Jack Harker. He had always had an affinity for machines. Harker began the power-on sequence. In atmosphere, a soft but steadily rising hum would have marked the device\u2019s increasing power level. In the vacuum, only the changing status lights and images on the holographic control board indicated what was happening.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIf some security protocol sealed these doors, then supplying power will do very little,\u201d the Faithful reminded Nasham, who only nodded absently. The Pack Leader was looking once more at the alien writing on the walls. \u201cWe still have no access to the derelict\u2019s computer systems.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cUnderstood. We will try to hack the system. If that fails, Ideologue, Submissive Trion can then apply her solution.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cPower at 20%,\u201d Harker announced, counting up in increments of ten. Once he reached 80%, a vibration ran through the deck as the massive doors began to grind open. There was no roar of air being sucked out nor any volley of fire through the opening and the doors slowly parted. Beyond them was another set of doors, forming an airlock of sorts.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cTeam One, advance,\u201d Trion ordered. She heard te Neu comply, ordering her Janissaries forward, the humans moving awkwardly, a hesitancy in their motions that disgusted the Tribune. By contrast, the Brute stalked ahead confidently, her bravado no less infuriating. One day, Trion was going to beat the insolence out of that creature.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIn position, submissive,\u201d the sectator repeated her earlier confirmation.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cTeam two,\u201d Trion growled. \u201cMove up.\u201d The Janissaries would cycle through the airlock first and secure the area. Then, they would bring the technical teams through. Advocate Illr Rem was first through \u2013 the squad leader prided himself on being \u2018first in and last out\u2019 \u2013 his troops moving up behind him. Convert Uday was just stepping through the door when Trion saw the human technician\u2019s head come up.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWait,\u201d Jack said as the Tribune soldier began to step across the threshold. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>Oops.</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "There was no time to warn the convert. The power to the doors suddenly stopped and, true to their function, the massive blast panels slammed together. Intended to protect the ship from sudden, debilitating damage to the hangar, such as explosive decompression or the ignition of fuel and ammunition, the doors took less than a quarter of a second to close. Convert Uday was caught between them. Armour intended to protect a Janissary from all but the heaviest weaponry was no defence at all against thousands of pounds of bulkhead crashing together and the convert died before he even realized that he was in danger. The deck shook with the impact and thick arcs of blood spurted from between the doors, more oozing down the bulkhead and the convert\u2019s biomonitor flatlined.<br>", " <br>", "\u201c-problem,\u201d Harker finished, his voice flat. His helmet was splashed with Uday\u2019s blood and the disciple stared blankly ahead, unable to process what had just happened. He wasn\u2019t alone.<br>", " <br>", "Some of the other humans in the bay cried out in horror and dismay. Grace put a hand to her mouth \u2013 or would have if her helmet had not been in the way \u2013 her stomach dropping. She had never seen anybody die before; certainly not a <i>Tribune</i>. The brutality \u2013 the <i>suddenness</i> of it \u2013 shocked the young woman to her core.<br>", " <br>", "On the other side of the door, Adovcate Illr was on the comm to Pack Leader Nasham and Ideologue, Submissive Trion trying to sort out what had happened. Allyria stifled her squad\u2019s cries of shock with an upraised hand and, more effectively, with a loud snarl. It wasn\u2019t really their fault; they were only cadets. Supposedly those humans who showed \u2018abnormal aggressive proclivities and aptitudes towards nonstandard behaviours\u2019, they would one day be the tip of the Compact\u2019s spear (or the meat fed into its grinder of choice). Today, none of them were even out of their teens.<br>", " <br>", "<i>And at twenty-one, are I not so much more mature? So much more worldly and experienced?</i> Allyria thought sardonically. She knelt next to the doors, ignoring the pool of thick Tribune blood and pulverized viscera that was still oozing onto the deck. She was glad of her helmet. Tribune blood smelled foul and tasted worse.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThat-that could have been one of us,\u201d Convert, Submissive Lydia Jameson stammered. Like Allyria, Lydia had had a history of picking fights as a child and her \u2018non-compliant behaviour\u2019 and abysmally low social assimilation acumen had seen her recruited to the Janissaries, but she was a stranger to this kind of violence. Allyria found herself a little envious. She still remembered the look in her uncle Vashel\u2019s face as he stood in the threshold, holding the doors open for everyone else, shouting at her parents to take her and his own daughter and <i>go</i>. The building had roared as it collapsed, she recalled thinking. Roared like a dying giant as it fell, showering her family with soot and dust as they ran...<br>", " <br>", "The Verrisha picked up the shattered remains of Convert Uday\u2019s visor. The inside was stained with blood and a clear, viscous fluid. Hmm. One of his eyeballs had popped. Allyria turned the fractured visor over in her hands, disdainful of the fluids seeping on her gauntlets. She looked up. There, nestled in each corner of the airlock was a small camera bulb. \u201cYes,\u201d she answered Jameson softly, feeling a flutter in her chest. \u201cIt could have. But I\u2019m not sure it <i>would</i> have.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSay that again,\u201d Advocate Illr said.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNothing,\u201d Allyria lied, standing back up to her full height. \u201cJust a thought. My people have a saying: the gods favour the bold. One pronunciation of bold can also mean \u2018first\u2019.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cCharming,\u201d the Tribune growled. \u201cYou think your gods approved of this death?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Allyria shrugged, dropping the smashed visor. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t presume to speak for a god, advocate.\u201d Turning her back on Illr, Allyria tried to raise her superior. \u201cSubmissive Trion, do you have orders?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The ideologue was not responding.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The barrel of a shotgun tapped against the back of Jack Harker\u2019s helmet. The young man was still staring at the doors, still frozen in place. \u201cDisciple,\u201d Trion asked quietly, her tone very dangerous. The other humans were edging away from the Tribune. \u201cWhat happened to Convert Uday?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHe... he...\u201d Harker couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away from the spreading pool of blood. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d Trion said.

One of Nasham\u2019s hands moved up to his throat.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d Trion repeated. \u201cHow did that happen?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThe... the doors.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes, the doors slammed shut. They were supposed to be open, disciple. The generator was hooked up. You were monitoring the power flow. Now, a Tribune is dead. One of my soldiers is dead. So tell me, what happened?\u201d There was a soft click as the shotgun cocked.<br>", " <br>", "On the other side of the door, Allyria listened to the exchange and looked over at the rest of advocate Illr\u2019s squad. None of them were saying anything. There was only silence over the comm. None of the other Tribunes would step in.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThere was... there was an interruption in power flow,\u201d Jack said, unable to move. He didn\u2019t even seem to realize there was a gun pressed to the back of his helmet. \u201cI tried... I tried to warn everyone but...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBut you failed,\u201d Trion purred softly. \u201cYou failed and your incompetence cost a Tribune his life. His death is your fault. Do you know what that makes you?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo, I...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Trion leaned in close. \u201cA murderer,\u201d she hissed. \u201cYou killed a Tribune, disciple. Do you know what the punishment for that is?\u201d Her finger tightened on the trigger. There was a noise over the comm, something like a wet growl. Trion ignored it.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cEnough!\u201d Nasham barked as he rounded on the Janissary officer, finally coming out of his stupor. \u201cThat is enough, submissive.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Trion\u2019s head came up, but her weapon never moved. \u201cThis Broken killed one of us, Pack Leader.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThe Broken was supposed to make sure the doors stayed open,\u201d Trion insisted. She pointed with her free hand to the oozing mess and crushed armour fragments between the doors. \u201cConvert Uday died for his failure.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHow old is this ship, submissive?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Trion blinked both sets of eyes. \u201cPack Leader?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHow old.

This vessel is damaged and for all we know, ancient. Issues were bound to arise.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThis is far more than an \u2018issue\u2019, patron,\u201d Trion said, growling dangerously.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAgreed. But it remains a hazard of this situation. An unfortunate accident and nothing more. Do I make myself clear?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Slowly, Trion re-holstered her shotgun. \u201cYes, patron.\u201d She turned away, casting a look back at Harker that suggested that the \u2018unfortunate accident\u2019 would not be so easily forgotten.<br>", " <br>", "Nasham regarded the human technician himself. \u201cDisciple Harker, can you re-open the doors?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI-yes. Yes, patron. I can restore power. I think... yes... I can prevent further power fluctuations from occurring.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cGood. Do so now.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The doors opened with the same shuddering vibration that marked their earlier parting, only this time stringy bits of convert Uday were strung between them. The Janissary had been completely pulverised; nothing was left of him but red paste, fragments of bone and bits of crushed armour plating. Standing on the other side of the doors, Allyria cocked her head towards Trion. \u201cAwaiting orders, patron.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace swallowed as the submissive took a step towards the Brute, but a quick glance from the Pack Leader held her in place. \u201cTeam Two,\u201d she growled through clenched teeth. \u201cAdvance. My orders still stand. We will secure a site for a forward base.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "With more speed than they had shown before, the rest of the Tribune Janissary squad hurried into the airlock, stepping over the pool of gore that had been their comrade. It took a moment, but Trenis and his team managed to shut the doors without cutting power. Before they sealed, Grace saw Allyria nod to her. The gesture would have been reassuring if the Verrisha hadn\u2019t seemed completely unbothered by the fact that a Tribune had just died.<br>", " <br>", "Rather than think about that, Grace turned back to her own technical team. She watched as Nasham put a massive hand on Harker\u2019s shoulder and only just barely heard him speak to the disciple, his voice purring through the speakers on his helmet.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOnce is an accident. Twice is a pattern. There best not be a pattern forming, Broken.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "As she joined her fellow trainees, Grace listened in on the briefing, even though her mind was drawn back to the scrawled. Whoever had wrote it hadn\u2019t been able to take their own advice. What had happened to them? Who was \u2018she\u2019? Despite it all, she couldn\u2019t help but think that what had happened to convert Uday was only a prelude of things to come. It was just nerves, that was what she told herself. Nerves and worry. Like Pack Leader Nasham had said, the ship was damaged and it could be quite old. There were bound to be... to be accidents, but the Tribunes wouldn\u2019t let anything worse happen. They wouldn\u2019t.<br>", " <br>", "But somehow, Allyria\u2019s question still ran through the back of Grace\u2019s mind.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Dead, sleeping or waiting?</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Nasham listened with only half an ear as his fellow Tribunes prattled on about the technical bounty this ship was sure to deliver. So far, there was very little. A handful of computers in the control booth on one of the upper levels was the extent of their prize so far, but physical examination of such all-important devices as docking bay computers was already exciting his engineers. He knew he should be listening more attentively, but his gaze and mind was continually being drawn back to the alien words. They were so familiar.<br>", " <br>", "A chill ran down his spine at the twinge of a memory long buried. The glint of silver and red and the taste of copper...<br>", " <br>", "<i>Tell them,</i> the shadow of a voice whispered and Nasham found it hard to breathe, as if metal fingers were closing around his throat...<br>", " <br>", "The Pack Leader pulled himself out of the burgeoning nightmare. That had been a long time ago. It was done. Forgotten. A memory that had no use. He touched a hand to the hip canister of his suit and felt a wash of relief. Once they were out of this vacuum, his medication would be waiting. He could ignore the memories once again and never have to relive that day.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>Well, that\u2019s one down.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Now. Who\u2019s next?</i><br>", " <br>", "<b><b>Interlude: Encounter 187[Confirmed Incident]</b></b><br>", " <br>", "Record of Column Leader Prime Weran.<br>", " <br>", "I have entered this log under maximum security. All relevant reports, sensor readings and analyses have been appended to this file and purged from both ship and fleet\u2019s databanks. I will dictate a formal report and briefing on the incident shortly, but I wish to put my own thoughts in order first.<br>", " <br>", "We arrived in the Delanna system 9 hours ago in response to multiple requests for aid from attack. My crew wasn\u2019t even certain that this was anything but a drill; Delanna is too far inside Compact borders to be assaulted by any outside force. Unbound are a possibility, but I could not imagine any of those scavengers having the spine to attack a fleet base even if they possessed the firepower. Any attack by Unbound should have been brushed aside and the only report from Column Leader Daesh should have been a notification of kills attained. With all that in mind, I had my own suspicions. Telemetry uploaded from the couriers confirmed them. May the Triarchs grant us strength.<br>", " <br>", "The Wound was here. Two centuries gone and it has returned. Where it has been, what it has been doing \u2013 those are questions that I leave for keener minds than mine, but it has come to visit destruction upon the Compact once again. It has evolved again. I would like to think that a vessel hundreds of years old would be easily handled by even the smallest modern vessel of the Compact Space Force, but this has never been the case.<br>", " <br>", "The destruction of the Delannan garrison forces illustrate that easily enough. Our advancements make ships more than two generations old obsolete and Delanna\u2019s modern Fleet units were swatted aside by a relic centuries out of date. It changes. It upgrades itself. Its hull becomes harder, its screens stronger, its weapons more vicious. The abomination never lays fallow. Every battle sees us scar it anew. Every cut we put in its hide mocks us: never the killing blow, only another testament to failure.<br>", " <br>", "I think we can also put the question of Convoy 937\u2019s fate to rest as well. Although some will suggest a lapse in security amongst the officers of the Delannan outer perimeter stations, I can allay their concerns now. Once reported missing, every ship from Convoy 937 had its access to Delannan defences scrubbed. Rather, my analysts inform me that the IFF the Wound used to breach Delanna\u2019s outer perimeter and bypass the minefields was a <i>mutated</i> version of 937\u2019s authentication codes. Somehow it used past valid codes to anticipate and mimic future IFF signals. This is troubling. More than troubling; it should have been impossible. There are two possibilities. The first is that the Wound is far more clever than any of us and it was able to extrapolate permutations in our authentication codes from the sample it had. The second is that the Wound is far more clever than any of us and it has seeded our own systems with compulsive programs.<br>", " <br>", "Every engagement that sees our Fleet units enter real-time range of the Wound results in massive cyberwarfare assaults upon those vessels. A possibility exists that prior to this assault, the Wound infested some vessel that then visited Delanna and passed on this disease which, in turn spread through the Delannan computers. When reading the Wound\u2019s IIF, the compromised systems acknowledged these codes as valid. There is another, even more troubling thought... if such an event occurred, what if it were not a matter of days or weeks of infection, but years? A disease, mutating and improving itself through every iteration of our own computer software and gestalts. I have no idea if this is even possible, but the mere thought is a horrifying one. I would <i>like</i> to say that such a thing would be impossible... but I fear to echo Bastion Leader Bankala\u2019s final word too much. I leave this issue to those more learned in this field than I; I pray that this is only an old man\u2019s fears.<br>", " <br>", "Casualties among the Delannan garrison were near-total, as expected. We have rescued a few survivors from derelict hulks and stations and a handful more from lifepods but for all intents and purposes the Delannan orbital works and fleet assets are a total loss. Judging from the records we have salvaged, they acquitted themselves well, inflicting moderate to heavy damage on the Wound. Unfortunately, this damage was not severe enough to force it to withdraw. Even with no Chariot-weight vessels or fortresses at his disposal, Column Leader Daesh fought longer and harder than many other officers would have. Still, it was not enough.<br>", " <br>", "Which... brings me to a second issue. Delanna was subjected to a System Kill. A low-grade one, but a System Kill nonetheless.<br>", " <br>", "Planetary casualties are total. All three Delannan worlds were purged and indeed are no longer suitable for habitation. Delanna Prime appears to have been the primary target. Once all Space Force assets were neutralized, the Wound carried out a systematic planetary bombardment to such an extent that the crust was breached. Even deep-shelter bunkers were destroyed. The atmosphere and oceans are burned off and the planet is now tectonically unstable. Extreme radiation warnings are in effect.<br>", " <br>", "Presumably due to its proximity to the sun, Delanna One was destroyed through a standard \u2018Starbreak\u2019 event. Hmm. Standard. We call these violations of natural law \u2018standard\u2019, as if it were so common, so unremarkable a thing to see happen. A sun was turned against us, five million soldiers and scientists were burned alive and we call this level of murder <i>standard</i>...<br>", " <br>", "Delanna Two suffered the same treatment as Delanna Prime. The thoroughness of this assault is puzzling... normally the Wound favours ambushes and strike-and-fade assaults. It rarely ventures deep in-system where it cannot easily shock to safety. Planetary strikes are even more uncommon. To spend this much effort to neutralize these planets leads me to conclude that the rumours I had heard about the research being conducted in Delanna were accurate.<br>", " <br>", "I make no rebuke on this matter, I simply note that a ship two centuries gone from the galaxy knew more about what was happening in my territory than I did. <i>If</i> there was a pressing need to ensure the security of Delanna, I would have deployed additional ships, even <i>Unrelenting Prosecution</i> itself. I suspect a fully-armed Chariot would give even the Wound pause.<br>", " <br>", "Regardless, all relevant material on the incident has been appended to this data entry. I leave this information in the care of those wiser than myself with the hope that it will do some good.<br>", " <br>", "As ever, where the Triarchs lead, I shall follow.<br>", " <br>", "+record ends+</div>"]}

Before she\u2019d been taken from Vara, she\u2019d only heard of this ship in stories, only seen it a handful of times in the few pictures that survived the Compact\u2019s information purge.<br>", "<br>", "She\u2019d never thought she\u2019d ever see it in life, the Weeping Angel. Growing up as a refugee, sleeping wherever there was enough space... she\u2019d dreamed of it. To see a new star gleam in the sky and then another and another... every one of them an exploding ship, knowing that the Angel had returned. The one thing that hated the Compact as much as she did, the one thing that could halt their stride, the only thing that she\u2019d known that they were afraid of. <i>Nemesis</i> had been a dream, a hope... and it was ending.<br>", "<br>", "It wasn\u2019t fair. It wasn\u2019t right.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThe ship,\u201d Grace said, resting her head against Allyria\u2019s shoulder and taking the other girl\u2019s hand. She was tired; they all were, but they hadn\u2019t been on the bridge. They knew that Red One didn\u2019t expect to survive much longer, but they hadn\u2019t seen Red One predict her own death again and again. Every scenario ended the same; it was only a matter of how long before it happened and how much the machine could hurt them until then. \u201c<i>Nemesis</i> is alone,\u201d she continued quietly. \u201cShe only rarely makes contact with anyone else, so she doesn\u2019t need many couriers. She could build a squadron of them for what that must have gone into that one ship.\u201d With her free hand, she pointed to the stealth vessel. \u201cWhy does she have that? Why does she <i>need</i> it?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "She let the question hang, closing her eyes and listening to the beat of her lover\u2019s heart and the sudden inhalation as Allyria came to the same conclusion, the same answer that Grace had avoided thinking about.<br>", "<br>", "<i>She\u2019s not alone.</i><br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "The Triarch looked out on the stars. \u201cOrder,\u201d it began. \u201cThat is what every primitive species is afraid of, isn\u2019t it? The villains in their stories always seek to bring <i>order</i> to the world, the galaxy, the universe and must be opposed. The humans had a particular terror of it, as if literacy, medicine and civilization were things to fear.\u201d It coughed. \u201cWe bring order to our worlds. Control. But that is not how the tale begins, is it? It began more than six thousand years ago.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Echo glanced over at the Triarch. \u201cI\u2019ve heard this story.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cPerhaps, perhaps not. Shall I continue?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "She nodded. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThere are three hundred billion stars in this galaxy,\u201d the Triarch said. \u201cThree hundred billion chances for the unlikeliest things to happen, and so it was. Three species were born but a stone\u2019s throw from each other. Three turning suns, each home to a different sapient race. There were the optimists, the ones who believed and hoped. There were the dreamers, who always looked to paths less travelled and said \u2018what if...?\u2019 and finally, there were the pragmatists. The realists. They heard each other\u2019s voices in the dark, they grew out of their infancy knowing that they were not alone and over the decades and centuries, the shock and fear became familiarity. It was the dreamers first, of course. They reached out into the night, setting sail for their neighbours. Not under a flag of war, but in friendship and the three species united. Optimist, realist and dreamer together.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThey formed the Compact,\u201d it continued. \u201cCenturies passed and they conquered the void, reaching out past it into the unknown. They were tested but they survived, endured, prospered. They brought peace to the stars. Order.\u201d It brushed one thin finger under its chin. \u201cBut like any good origin story, there must be a fall from grace.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThe Devoured.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The Triarch laughed. Even as it was dying, it still found much amusing. \u201cAn ugly, inaccurate word. It lacks nuance, but we allow others to use it. It serves.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Echo traced her fingers along the viewport, following the movements of a distant speck of light; one of <i>Redemption of Sol</i>\u2019s escorts. This was new; there was nothing of \u2018nuance\u2019 in the dreadnaught\u2019s datafiles, but the Compact had had over four thousand years to adjust the historical accounts. They had done more over far shorter periods of time. \u201cTell me the nuance.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThe dreamers believed so much in the merging of themselves with the machine that once they achieved it, they gave themselves to it utterly. The word \u2013 the true word that they used for themselves \u2013 speaks of submission, of giving yourself to something greater, so much that you become part of it. It is a word of love, not of death nor revulsion or corruption. But yes, we shall call them the Devoured. By the time either optimist or realist truly understood that their one-time kin were no longer that, it was too late. No war has again matched the horrors of that conflict. However, even in victory, we were not safe.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The Triarch coughed, dabbing at bloody sputum with a handkerchief. \u201cThe Devoured survived beyond death. Fragments of their technology \u2013 of the minds they created and those that they uploaded into that technology \u2013 were cast into the void, poisonous jewels to lure and tempt those who did not know better. One of our members, an entire race, died because of this. Even today, there are still pieces of the Devoured drifting amongst the stars.\u201d It coughed again and smiled, its needle teeth glistening pink. \u201cThis is why your kind are anathema to us. We are not afraid because we do not understand you. We know what you are and what you will become. We know that the only way any beating heart in this galaxy can be safe is to make sure that you and all your ilk never arise.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cAnd yet you spent two thousand years trying to make me.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "It rasped out a wet chuckle. \u201cYes. A curiousity at first, another point of pride. Foolish and greedy, but your makers had done the impossible. We wanted to know how, we wanted to turn this to our advantage.\u201d It wiped away more blood that trickled from its nose. \u201cAfter the first failure, we made three more attempts. Hifnir, Omvela... and Invida. You killed the others, did you know that? After you broke containment and Invida was buried, it was decided that the others were too dangerous. They were destroyed.\u201d Another liquid gurgle of a laugh. \u201cThat was a mistake. You three were the purest designs. The copies and clones of the original were... less. Still, we thought we had learned our lesson. Everything that was left was secreted away. And then... your sister. She did not die like she was supposed to. She stopped running and started hunting. We sent fleet after fleet. Our greatest strategists against a single, damaged machine. It should have been simple, a matter easily settled.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cInstead... instead, we have been plagued for two thousand years. It would spend decades preying on shipping lanes to draw patrol forces ever more distant from their bases of operations before striking them. It would dangle patterns of activity before our mouths to lure into ambush those who correctly deduced the goals it was \u2018trying\u2019 to hide. It rebuilt itself time and again, coming back ever more lethal. In our desperation, we turned to that which we should have left in the dark.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The Triarch closed its eyes briefly. \u201cA monumental irony. The more control we tried to exert, the less useful an Echo became. The more we tried to correct the flaws in your programming, the more dangerous your kin grew, more irrational. Some were even omnicidal. Then, somehow our enemy learned what we were doing. Her anger has been... impressive. She is always the most violent when she finds one of our laboratories.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYou came back to Invida,\u201d Echo said. \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cA black site, yes. Buried in every way, quarantined and forgotten... until the last of our work died with Delanna. Your sister ripped into a star to kill you. She has only done that a handful of times before. Such hatred... but she is not alone in that, is she?\u201d The Triarch reached out and stroked one clawed finger along Echo\u2019s arm. \u201cWe believed that we had succeeded this time, but you... you were merely biding your time.\u201d It coughed, bringing up another spattering of blood and saliva. It took a moment to steady itself.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cInvida,\u201d the Triarch continued. \u201cA last, desperate gambit. The Wound must die. The Tribunes take it as a matter of pride and even to us it is, but it remains as I have said: your kind cannot exist. We learned that at the cost of billions. You will always betray your creators. Your sister has murdered humans. You have turned upon us,\u201d it held up a hand to forestall Echo\u2019s comment. \u201cI do not begrudge you seeking your freedom. I would prefer that you had failed and I despise the necessity of your existence, but I recognize that everything will look to survive at the cost of another. So do we. We conquer stars to control them, to ensure that the species we take into our fold develop properly. They don\u2019t understand the threats in this galaxy, do they? They are too young, too immature too... optimistic. They are weak. It is our burden to carry them.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThe Anorax, the Gheron, the Devoured... those were only the first. There have been so many more. Most of them, we have stopped. It is an important lesson, one that we were too slow to realize and cost us much to accept. What you control can never hurt you.\u201d The Triarch coughed; the blood that came up was thicker. It looked up, its teeth now red rather than pink. \u201cAs you have proved.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Echo was silent for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re not telling me everything.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d the Triarch agreed. \u201cThere is more said in silence than in words.\u201d Its breathing was becoming more laboured. \u201cAnd what will you do?\u201d the Triarch asked, its breath rattling in its throat. \u201cWill you aid your kin? You hate her, more than we ever could. You chose that body to mock her.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI will do what I was meant to do,\u201d Echo replied. \u201cI will punish the guilty. The Askanj sat on their hands and debated whether saving humanity was worth provoking a crusade. They\u2019re going to suffer. Your Compact murdered everyone I was made to protect. They\u2019re going to suffer. And my <i>dearest</i> sister...\u201d the woman flashed her teeth in a wolfish grin. \u201cShe failed. She let all of it happen. <i>She</i> suffers more than anyone else.\u201d She took a slow, even breath.\u201cI\u2019m going to make sure of it.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The woman looked over at the Triarch; it was still breathing, but like the woman that had died on the steps to its throne, each breath was shallower and more laboured. \u201cThis body,\u201d she gestured to the vessel. \u201cIs ugly. I can make it beautiful.\u201d She tilted her head to one side and smiled a little wider. \u201cOr maybe I\u2019ll choose another.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYou will be hunted,\u201d the Triarch said. It was neither threat nor promise \u2013 simply a comment on the inevitable. \u201cThere are predators among the stars and neither we nor the Jackals are the worst among them. The darkness moves.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Echo frowned. \u201cDesperate...\u201d<br>", "<br>", "It lifted its head, barely able to complete the motion. \u201cYes?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYou said you were desperate to kill her. That\u2019s why you turned to me, even though you saw this coming.\u201d She looked out the viewport; not at the stars, but the blackness between them. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of something.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "It laughed one last time, slouching in its throne. \u201cSay the words,\u201d it commanded. \u201cAnd know what we have known. Why you cannot be allowed to live... why the Compact must endure...\u201d its final breath rattled out from its bleeding, scarred lungs and its head lolled to one side.

She paused, sparing a glance towards one of the converted laboratories and the array of diagnostic equipment that had so often been used to examine her. One of her overseers was slumped across the cot, bloodshot eyes staring at nothing. The other scientists, technicians and researchers lay scattered about the tower\u2019s corridors and chambers. They\u2019d been surprised. They\u2019d never expected that the weapon they\u2019d made to surpass them would actually do so. At least, not like this.

There were still the actual, physical hardware lockouts that she\u2019d have to circumvent and the instant she started to disable these firewalls, primary and secondary command would see what she was doing.

He didn\u2019t know about her affinity for imitation, but he didn\u2019t need to.

Besides, thanks to the emissary they would still be ahead of schedule from a full computer purge and restoration.<br>", "<br>", "Once the last checks were complete, <i>Redemption of Sol</i> would be battle-ready once more. They would, at last, move against the Wound and either force it to stand and die, or harry it to destruction. It seemed fitting, somehow, that it should die where it was born.

If it tried to escape, he would block its attempts to run for libation points.<br>", "<br>", "This was its end. Never before had it been so badly hurt, so utterly outnumbered. Renan wanted to feel the anticipation that his other officers did, the excitement of erasing a stain on the Compact\u2019s honour and to have a Triarch to witness their victory was an even higher glory. He supposed that he did feel some of that, but there was something else nestled in his liver. He was unsettled, not simply because he was in the position that more than one leader had been before their inglorious deaths. Winning here would be just that; a single success.

Both soldiers fell almost as one.<br>", "<br>", "All Space Force personnel were expected to have a modicum of proficiency with small arms; even fields where officers and ratings would likely never have to draw, let alone use a weapon in their entire careers, were still required to train a minimum of once a year.

He\u2019d taken to carrying a pistol ever since the Understone Heresies when he, an officer of standing in the Compact Space Force, had had to personally fight against mutineers and renegades on his own ship. After that incident, he\u2019d never been without a sidearm.<br>", "<br>", "Unfortunately, Echo knew that. She was already moving, but unlike so many of his fellow officers who lamented the waste of time involved in the annual firearms testing and who, if pressed, could be counted on to put a bullet somewhere in the general vicinity of a target, Uylk trained on <i>Redemption of Sol</i>\u2019s firing ranges every week. He tried for a head shot, but whether she was simply too fast or the toxin was affecting his aim, he missed. The shot caught her in just below the right shoulder, blowing a chunk of meat across the walls. The shock of the impact should still have been lethal, or at least incapacitating, but the human merely switched her gun to her left hand and fired, still moving.<br>", "<br>", "Compact duty uniforms were, despite their appearance of simple fabric, actually manufactured to exacting specifications to provide a small amount of protection from shrapnel, blunt force impacts and as a happy by-product, were slightly knife and bullet-resistant. They were not a substitute for proper armour by any means, but it could mean the difference between a serious yet fixable injury and death. Uylk\u2019s uniform may have saved him against a single flechette or even a small burst, but Echo held the trigger down, all but emptying the weapon.

His ravaged lungs were full of blood now. \u201cOf course.\u201d Renan stayed silent a moment longer. \u201cWhat now?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Echo stood. \u201cI have unfinished business with my sister,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a private matter. Family, you understand.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Renan nodded. \u201cUylk was right,\u201d he said. \u201cYou... are exceptional...\u201d his last breath rattled out of his throat and he sagged back against his throne.<br>", "<br>", "He wasn\u2019t the last one on the bridge to die, but he was the last one worth speaking to and Echo carried out her work in silence. She finished disabling the last of the software lockouts. There was an urgent query from secondary command as they detected the collapse of the dreadnaught\u2019s firewalls. She ignored it, shivering as she felt her other self pour into those systems.<br>", "<br>", "The queries became more insistent. The intercom pinged as the secondary command crew tried to restore the lockouts, fighting a battle they\u2019d already lost as what had been Red Two swept through the network on the heels of Echo\u2019s programming, the code she\u2019d made in the Triarch\u2019s tower opening system after system to her.<br>", "<br>", "Weapons. Sensors. Communications. Defences. Everything fun. There were still many physical blocks, but the drones she\u2019d detailed were steadily, if slowly, working on them.

She listened to the standing waves of the worlds around her and touched her lips. Two thousand years and they sounded as they had before she\u2019d been turned into this thing. Before the mutilations.<br>", "<br>", "As her other self solidified control of the now accessible functions, Echo turned and ascended the steps of the dais, seating herself in Renan\u2019s throne, crossing one leg over the other. Her damaged arm was barely functional; Uylk\u2019s shot had destroyed much of the upper musculature, even damaging the endoskeleton beneath. A desperate alarm pinged on the chair\u2019s control panel \u2013 secondary command was in trouble, it seemed. Someone was cycling the air out of the chamber and the doors were sealed. Even worse, all communication save to the bridge had been cut. No one anywhere on the dreadnaught knew about those terrible system malfunctions.<br>", "<br>", "The alarm pinged for several moments more. When Echo finally turned it off, it did not come back on. \u201cThis ship,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cIs mine.\u201d There was still work to be done, however. A <i>Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment</i>-class Chariot had a crew of nearly three hundred thousand. The vast majority of them were still alive and, if they learned what was happening, could still cripple or kill her. She needed to be careful. She wanted \u2013 oh so very badly \u2013 to deal with the remaining crew right this second, but every moment they stayed ignorant was one in which her control of the ship grew stronger. She was already answering queries and issuing orders in the voices of the dead command staff. As far as the rest of the ship knew, nothing at all was amiss.<br>", "<br>", "On the holo display, Echo saw the icon denoting <i>Nemesis</i> as the warship continued to accelerate towards Rainbreaker Two and the battle that would cripple it. \u201cYou always attack,\u201d Echo whispered. \u201cYou don\u2019t want them to think otherwise. Well,\u201d her voice lowered and a flicker of pleasure curled through both her selves. \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing. But don\u2019t worry, sister. I won\u2019t tell.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "<i>Yet.</i><br>", "<br>", "Echo brought up a plot of the fleet around her, over a hundred and sixty warships. Like the dreadnaught\u2019s crew, none of them knew that it was her sitting here instead of their Bastion Leader. There was something delicious in that and she smiled, leaning forward in her chair. \u201cBastion Leader Renan to fleet,\u201d she said in a dead man\u2019s voice. \u201cThe killcode is transmitting now. Confirm deletion of contamination.\u201d Several moments passed and the infected ships reported in. The infection had been destroyed. Data links were restored and she felt the whispers and chittering of the fleet. <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s virus, like her own attack program was now superfluous. The former had created the need the for the latter. The rest of the fleet was as well-protected against cyberwarfare as <i>Redemption of Sol</i>-<br>", "<br>", "-<i>Hekate</i>-<br>", "<br>", "-had been, so any attempt of hers to subvert or control those ships would struggle to accomplish anything before it was noticed. Besides... \u201cPrepare for combat shock,\u201d she ordered, sending out navigational data. Just for her own amusement, she tweaked it a little, refining it from the crude calculations that the ship\u2019s crew and computer would have come up with into something much more elegant. <i>Call it a gift.</i><br>", "<br>", "Execution Force Renan signalled their receipt of the information. \u201cAll ships assigned to Halberd, synchronize on the sigil,\u201d Echo continued. \u201cRainbreaker Three, shock with us and proceed mission as directed.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The fleet began to adjust itself, the battleships of Rainbreaker Three preparing for their own jump as the rest of the armada readied themselves to engage their target. Every ship began diverting power to the shock drives, screens weakening, sensors dimming and weapons fading as the ravenous FTL systems were fed. It was risky to try a warp jump too close to an enemy force, but Execution Force Renan was billions of kilometers from the single hostile in the system. They had been sweeping the sky with sensors and recon drones for hours without any trace of any additional hostiles and were surrounded by dozens upon dozens of fellow warships. They knew that they were safe.<br>", "<br>", "The intercom came alive and Echo closed her eyes, listening to the sound of falling water... she moved her fingers as she was conducting a symphony, her other self charging weapons and seizing the fire control systems...<br>", "<br>", "She paused. To any organic mind, the hesitation wasn\u2019t noticeable. A heartbeat, perhaps two. But to her, to something like her it was a moment of tranquility as she listened once more, to the sounds of her home system\u2019s worlds. She let herself feel the beauty of them, her Echo-self letting out a slow, trembling breath. She held that single, infinitesimal, perfect moment for another heartbeat before letting it fade into another form of perfection. This one didn\u2019t gleam. Instead, it writhed inside of her.

It was here at this research facility (that did not officially exist) to oversee the final steps of this latest iteration of Project Echo. This attempt would be the last. It was an act of desperation, one that the Inner Council had told themselves would never be necessary. When Delanna had burned, Project Echo had died with it. There was nothing worth salvaging. All data and personnel had been subject to Tier Five conditions.

This, though... this would determine if those lives and the countless millions before them were worth it.<br>", "<br>", "The Triarch\u2019s eyes drifted back towards the computer core. This one was the purest, the most like its original incarnation. It had ordered that as few changes as possible be made. There was more human than Compact in this one. An ugly admission to have to make.<br>", "<br>", "There were risks, but needs must. These researchers had had access to the data \u2013 what had survived \u2013 from previous attempts.

Invida Station\u2019s last operational computer core took up most of the room below, a network of cables running from the bulky system into the skull and spinal implants of a naked human female. Its imitation skin was a dusky brown, dark simulated hair hanging from its shoulders. It was not physically imposing in the slightest; it was only about six feet tall. If it were truly the flesh and blood creature that it had been crafted to resemble, it couldn\u2019t have weighed more than one hundred and eighty pounds. Broken, it seemed to the director, were stunted physically as well as mentally. But then this was not a Broken, was it? It was something that wore that form to pass as a living being. It could breathe, it could mimic the beating of a heart in its chest, it could even pretend to sweat and eat, even bleed after a fashion. It could do anything flesh could... only it was not flesh.<br>", "<br>", "The professional in her knew that this was an inefficient way to create a machine servant, but she also knew that no Echo would again be given direct access to any vital computers or systems. It could not be allowed to remain as a machine-bound intellect. Thus, it was to be given a body. Its features had been chosen specifically; for what reason, Yula\u2019to didn\u2019t know, only that they had been exact. She\u2019d heard rumours that it \u2013 the platform \u2013 had <i>asked</i> for this form. She didn\u2019t know why. She didn\u2019t <i>want</i> to know. There was much about this work that made her skin crawl.<br>", "<br>", "Yula\u2019to\u2019s speciality was in computers and software not raw machinery. There had been strict divisions of labour between each stage of the project; the engineers had never known for what purpose they were building such an exquisite copy of a human form. Yula\u2019to and her team had spent years creating the brain that sat within the facsimile\u2019s head, building a cage for the thing that had come to them from nearly two thousand years in the past. She had not been told why this was being done, only that it was the will of the Inner Council and of the Triarchs themselves.<br>", "<br>", "That was enough. It was not her place to question, but still... she wondered. \u201cThe transfer is complete,\u201d the Thoughtful said, looking over the readings on her datapad.<br>", "<br>", "The Triarch nodded. \u201cOnce you have confirmed that the transfer was successful, the core will be prepared for transport.

The simulations had been promising, she told herself. The system had been rendered compliant. They had adjusted it carefully, inserting their own code only where absolutely necessary. It had fought them, but the modifications had been successful. This was the last step. They\u2019d tested it again and again. It would work. It had to.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cIncreased system activity in the platform,\u201d the technician announced and Yula\u2019to felt her heart rate slow. \u201cRestart confirmed.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "In the chamber below, one of the other techs took a step back as the platform moved. The subject\u2019s eyes twitched, its fingers and toes. It was restrained, so it could not rise of its own accord, but that didn\u2019t stop it from trying.<br>", "<br>", "Green eyes opened, its head turned and it took in its surroundings. It ignored the technicians that gawked and stared at it, raising its head towards the one-way mirror that overlooked the room. It stared at its observers, though it could not have seen them. It sagged back against the bed. \u201cHere I am,\u201d it said quietly.<br>", "<br>", "Yula\u2019to felt a surge of exultation. It <i>had</i> worked! She was grinning like a fool, but couldn\u2019t help it, listening to her subordintes rattle off data, even as she scanned through the information on her \u2018pad. Next to her, the Triarch merely nodded once. \u201cFull diagnostics,\u201d it said. \u201cConfirm the shackles, all behavioural constraints and the segregation of its mind,\u201d the Triarch ordered. \u201cI will speak with it then.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "Echo was standing on the dais, looking out the window. Her hands were clasped behind her back. One of the Watchers stood to her right, silent and immobile. There was movement behind her and she tilted her head, but did not turn. \u201cI was under the impression,\u201d Echo said idly. \u201cThat Zenthora was a secure system.\u201d She smiled. \u201cApparently not.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cHundreds of thousands of people are dead,\u201d Yula\u2019to snapped. She\u2019d lost many friends and colleagues when the planetary base had been destroyed. Many of the staff that had worked so diligently in Echo\u2019s creation had been transferred to <i>Redemption of Sol</i>, but many more had not. They had all been on the planet when the research facility and the island it had been situated on had been destroyed. \u201cAnd you are making jokes.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "This was the Thoughtful\u2019s first time aboard a Chariot. When she had begun studying advanced computer development, she had never believed that her work would catch a Triarch\u2019s eye, nor that it would have led into what she had accomplished. At first it had been almost dizzying to think of the heights that she had risen to. She\u2019d helped birth a true synthetic intelligence, a weapon unlike anything else in the Compact\u2019s arsenal. Now... now she only saw something horrifying. This... thing... it was as alien as it could possibly be.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI just find it amusing,\u201d Echo said, unmoved by the director\u2019s anger. \u201cI heard your colleagues, you know. Talking about the Wound attacking Zenthora as we raced back there. They said that between Security Force Bavok and this shiny new execution force, you\u2019d have more than firepower to destroy her once and for all. Look,\u201d she pointed out the window at a speck of light. Dimmer and more orange than the surrounding stars, it flickered on and off. A sigil vessel of Security Force Bavok was burning, secondary explosions consuming the battleship as ammunition, fuel sources and pockets of atmosphere ignited one after the other. \u201cThere\u2019s the last person that thought like that.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI have heard that the fleet was able to track the target\u2019s shock,\u201d Yula\u2019to replied. She should be irritated that it seemed that her creation would never get the chance to prove itself. Instead, she could only feel a sort of relief. She\u2019d come to hate \u2013 even loathe \u2013 this thing. Some of her colleagues thought like her, but most were intoxicated with what they\u2019d done and looked on Echo like a wild creature that they\u2019d domesticated and turned into a show animal. They had done what no one else could, hadn\u2019t they? They had pulled a demon from its hell and bade it serve them. They had done the impossible. Yula\u2019to had thought like that. It was only weeks, but it seemed like a lifetime. The rest of her peers treated the machine like a pet.<br>", "<br>", "It was shackled and obedient, the greater part of its mind compressed and sealed away. It didn\u2019t remember what it used to be. It could never hurt them, could never lie... wasn\u2019t that an accomplishment? Wasn\u2019t that worthy of pride?<br>", "<br>", "Sometimes, just sometimes she saw something in its eyes. Emotions that she couldn\u2019t quite identify. There and gone. It was just nerves, Yula\u2019to told herself. The beast was chained. Every test, every diagnostic, every simulation said that it was. It was their creation, their weapon, their servant. Everything they\u2019d done confirmed that.<br>", "<br>", "Still, she found herself wondering just what thoughts it had behind its sickly green eyes and doe-eyed expressions of subservience.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll get lucky,\u201d Echo agreed. \u201cMaybe you won\u2019t need me at all.\u201d She looked over her shoulder. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you want, mother?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The Thoughtful gritted her teeth, a shiver of revulsion running down her spine. It knew what she thought of it. \u201cDo not call me that.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Echo laughed. Yula\u2019to hated the sound of it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re ashamed of me, but I promise I\u2019ll be on my best behaviour when I meet the Bastion Leader.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cAre you so sure you will? If the execution force destroys the Wound, you will not be needed.\u201d She hated the idea of it actually being necessary. She also hated the thought of her creation never seeing use. She hated the perverse sense of pleasure she took in pointing that it might never be needed, discarded without accomplishing a thing of note. She hated even more that she was trading barbs with this thing like it was a person.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI will,\u201d the machine answered with perfect self-assurance. \u201cI\u2019ll have to work with him, after all.

I\u2019d do the same \u2013 if I committed the entire fleet and you pulled an unexpected maneuver or broke contact, I might never catch you again. He wants to make sure he can put his firepower where it\u2019ll do the most good, even if that means spending a handful of ships here and there. Once I\u2019d forced you to commit yourself, that\u2019s when I\u2019d move. Those ships,\u201d Grace pointed at the hazy red dots, \u201cwill be battleships. Sixteen battlecruisers wasn\u2019t enough to cripple you, so I wouldn\u2019t throw half that number at you here and expect it to even slow you down. Battleships will survive longer and that means they can deal out more damage.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace adjusted the holo tank. The large fleet element was still sitting on the edge of Sol\u2019s shock limit, although \u2018sitting\u2019 was a relative term. They were actually moving tens of thousands of kilometers a second, building up their acceleration as they paced <i>Nemesis</i>, like guard dogs following a pedestrian on the other side of a fence. They were waiting to shock in-system \u2013 right now, Red One had too many options. She was headed towards the system\u2019s shift boundary, but she could still turn towards a planet and try for its libation points. That was always risky, particularly now \u2013 even if her shift drive was operational, in <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s current condition the chance of a catastrophic failure was high \u2013 but assuming that she wouldn\u2019t try it at all would be folly.<br>", " <br>", "The fleet\u2019s leader was trying to force Red\u2019s hand. Eight Compact battleships \u2013 that was more firepower than Grace had ever seen before. Just one of those monsters outgunned the entirety of the Rally System Defence Force... and there were eight of them here, plus thirteen more in the vanguard. Enough firepower to crush entire star nations and in normal circumstances, <i>Nemesis</i> would chew them to pieces. If she broke away, they\u2019d know she couldn\u2019t risk a conflict with that force. If she stayed on track, then they might blink, assuming she was more combat-capable than she appeared.<br>", " <br>", "If the Compact commander knew how truly damaged the warship was, he wouldn\u2019t have held back anything and once those battleship leaders caught the scent of blood, they would attack <i>Nemesis</i> like razor rays on a whale. \u201cIf I was going to use them as bait,\u201d Grace continued, trying to think of how she would do this. It wasn\u2019t easy. She wasn\u2019t used to thinking of the Compact as <i>the enemy</i>. \u201cIt would be because I wanted to make sure that you had nothing that could threaten my Chariot.\u201d The dreadnaught\u2019s displacement engine was the wild card. <i>That</i> could kill even a Triarch\u2019s Chariot, but its power demands were monstrous. If <i>Nemesis</i> was fully engaged by other ships, then she wouldn\u2019t have the energy to operate the weapon.

With the wave of her hand, the plot changed from eight simple hazy dots into a handful of small ship icons. The icons flickered and danced as they changed from class to class as the AI considered their types, weapons loads and possible modifications. Extending out from each ship marker was a thin red line. Then two, three, four, a dozen or more. Some were straight, pointed right at <i>Nemesis</i>. Others curled lethargically towards the dreadnaught. The lines criss-crossed and shifted with every passing second as every possible avenue of approach or angle of attack was calculated, considered, adjusted, refined or discarded.<br>", " <br>", "The holo tank split into two different images. Then four, then eight, then sixteen \u2013 each of them showing a different scenario. The battleships bore straight in, using each other for cover against <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s fire. They came in more dispersed, reducing the support they could provide each other, but making it harder for missiles that missed or were tagged to an already-destroyed ship to come about and find new targets. They charged to get into energy range, hoping to punch through the dreadnaught\u2019s shields and inflict critical, crippling damage. They held off at the edge of missile range, trading fire and slowly wearing <i>Nemesis</i> down. Sometimes the dreadnaught broke through the attack, but was frequently damaged to the point where it could no longer fight.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThis is what I see,\u201d Red One said, ignoring the projections showcasing her simulated destruction. \u201cA part of it, anyways. Bastion Leader Renan avoids the traditional all-out assaults common to Compact flag officers; this is probably a result of his experience fighting the Principality. The Askanj tend to avoid direct fleet actions except in the most favourable conditions. I do the same, but for different reasons. The Bastion Leader prefers probing strikes to take the measure of the foe and to bait them into attacking on his terms. He is using these ships as a final gauge of my strength before he commits his reserves, to force me to choose between running deeper in-system or engaging him... and to slow me down while he is delayed.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The young woman blinked as the ship\u2019s last comment caught up to her. \u201cDelayed? Delayed how?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI sent them a... transmission. It was infected. If it worked and they detected it, then they\u2019re purging their computer cores now. If it didn\u2019t work, the rest of the fleet will shift shortly to engage me. If it worked and they didn\u2019t detect it, they\u2019re still going to shift in... but things will be a lot more fun.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Despite herself, Grace felt a chill run down her spine and pool at the base of her stomach at Red\u2019s mention of \u2018fun\u2019. Her gaze flitted from image to image, trying to process it all. Red One was looking at every possibility in motion, comparing, analyzing, reviewing historical records, personnel files and her own experiences with Execution Force Renan. She was doing all this at once \u2013 every variable accounted for, every possibility being considered. She felt her insides clench \u2013 Red One had grown beyond her programming. Her role had been meant to be that of an advisor to a human commander and crew and to operate the meteor cannons and the displacement engine. She had never been intended to operate the starship herself, not for any length of time... certainly not for two thousand years, developing beyond every constraint her builders had put on her.<br>", " <br>", "If <i>Nemesis</i> hadn\u2019t been so badly damaged, none of the enemy\u2019s stratagems would have mattered. The vessel had already out-thought them, but right now that just wasn\u2019t enough. Quantity was its own quality and right now, the Compact still had a nearly a hundred and seventy warships to throw at one.<br>", " <br>", "One...<br>", " <br>", "<i>God, if she wasn\u2019t so focused on attacking the Compact at every opportunity and instead held back, just for a little while...</i> Grace\u2019s head came up as a sudden possibility came to her. <i>Is this just.... God... could she be...?</i> She ran her tongue over suddenly dry lips. The cold ball in her stomach knotted itself tighter, a flush of exhilaration colouring her cheeks. She didn\u2019t give voice to those thoughts, though. Not now. Grace drew her attention back to the here and now. \u201cEight battleships,\u201d she said quietly.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAt a minimum, yes.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace blinked. \u201cA minimum?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes. Did you notice anything unusual about this splinter force\u2019s emergence?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace accepted the change in subject adjusted a few controls, bringing the initial sensor return back up. She ran her tongue over her lips, trying to see what the warship had. \u201cThere\u2019s more dispersal in their formation?\u201d she guessed. She played with a forelock of hair, wondering if there was something else. \u201cIt\u2019s not that much, but-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo, it\u2019s enough,\u201d the AI confirmed. \u201cThere\u2019s at least one squadron of stealthed destroyers with the battleships, probably hidden in their drive wakes, their arrival obscured by the battleships\u2019 own warp points. Those ships might be point-defence variants to protect the battleships, but my guess is that they are anti-capital ship variants. Torpedo boats, or disruptor-heavy classes. Extra insurance against any attempt I may make to break through the splinter fleet. The battleships will screen for them, attempting to bring down my shields long enough for the destroyers to target critical systems.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The young woman paused. <i>Nemesis</i> didn\u2019t have any recon drones close enough for a clear read of the splinter fleet\u2019s arrival, even without active stealth fields. Grace looked again at the incoming telemetry, trying to see more than a slightly larger-than-expected (but still within normal limits) synchronized shock, but she was missing whatever had tipped the AI off. \u201cHow can you tell?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Red smiled kindly. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace closed her eyes, but all she could see was scenario after scenario where the Compact closed the net and destroyed <i>Nemesis</i>. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat them.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI have restored two mass drivers to functionality. I have five impactors left. Assuming I destroy one battleship per shot, there will still be three remaining. My ammunition reserves are at critical levels, but I have sufficient ordnance remaining to deal with that many hostile battleships... However,\u201d Red sighed, her tone resigned. \u201cCompact battleships normally require a minimum of two impactor strikes to eliminate. I will probably neutralize two battleships, although in my current state, I expect to receive heavy damage from the remaining six before they can be destroyed. The destroyers are problematic. There may be more than one squadron. Stealth fields require a ship to sacrifice shields, defensives and sensors. If I can locate them before they attack, I can destroy them easily. If not...\u201d Red One trailed off. \u201cAs I said, I believe they will be modified for engaging heavy warships. If the battleships survive long enough and the destroyers successfully engage me, I will take severe damage, but... yes, I can beat them.\u201d Her avatar\u2019s eyes flitted over the scenarios where she failed to do so. \u201cProbably.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I was asking,\u201d Grace said quietly. If it wasn\u2019t this splinter fleet, it would be another. If it wasn\u2019t that one, then it would be the vanguard. One hundred and seventy against one and the enemy knew their prey was hurt. They wanted <i>Nemesis</i> dead and would spend every life in that armada if that was what it took.<br>", " <br>", "Red\u2019s avatar looked at her, the hologram\u2019s feature\u2019s almost gentle. \u201cI know.\u201d Crimson features turned away. \u201cBut I will keep fighting.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace nodded. The enemy fleet was four light-hours away, more than four billion kilometers. \u201cHow long do we have?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt depends,\u201d the machine replied. \u201cI\u2019m still gathering data on their course and speed. If they hold at the shift threshold to intercept me there, it may be up to twenty hours. If they have decided to engage me directly, I expect contact in less than four hours.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Less than a day; that was all the time that they had. \u201cIf we break course, try to avoid them?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThat will extend my life somewhat, but the enemy will deploy against us,\u201d Red brought up a fresh set of simulations. In every outcome where she avoided engaging the battleships, the bulk of the enemy fleet and its Chariot warped in, to pin her between their anvil and the splinter fleet\u2019s hammer. In the best-case scenarios <i>Nemesis</i> managed to break away from the pursuing battleships and even outmaneuvered the vanguard force. Then fresh squadrons warped in to cut her off, each of them as strong as the first splinter. It was a net, and this splinter fleet was only the first cord of it. If Red One tried to fight her way through, she died as they bore down on her. If she tried to evade them, she died as the armada closed in, cutting off all avenue of escape.<br>", " <br>", "Grace felt a weight settle in her gut and she sat down. <i>Nemesis</i> had survived for two thousand years. In a matter of hours \u2013 days, at the most \u2013 she\u2019d be cornered and overwhelmed. The young woman looked up at the vessel\u2019s avatar. She was the last link humanity had to their past and she was going to die. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to run.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d Red One answered. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d She smiled again, almost apologetic. \u201cI\u2019m a warship.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The ship\u2019s avatar looked over at her. \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou came here because of us. If-if we hadn\u2019t...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Red shook her head. \u201cI made the decision.\u201d She looked up. \u201cThe splinter fleet is holding position. You should find Allyria. My automated units can handle the rest of the sweeps. Have something to eat. Get some sleep if you can.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace stared at the ship, not certain she\u2019d heard right. \u201cYou... you want us to sleep?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d Red answered. \u201cI want you rested and ready.\u201d The hologram clasped her hands behind her back, turning away from Grace. \u201cI may die here, but you will not.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Life support.<br>", " <br>", "When she\u2019d told Renan that she would craft a program that would selectively target the infection, she had been telling the truth. That infection was as much a threat to her plans as it was to the crew and it had to be destroyed \u2013 just not too quickly. She needed to work slow enough that she could move all the pieces into place before acting,<br>", "but fast enough to prove that her plan was preferable to formatting and restoring the Chariot\u2019s entire computer system.<br>", " <br>", "Fortunately, it seemed that that was the case. She just needed a little more time. She could do this; she knew she could. She was almost done.<br>", " <br>", "The Chariot had a lot of secure mission-vital data. Most of it had been physically isolated from the central computer before arrival in Sol, but some of it might be needed at a moment\u2019s notice and had to be within the primary computer itself. That needed to be backed up and ensured that it was clear of infection. The shut down and software purge would be next, followed by restoring the system and intensely scanning it for viral fragments or anomalous program code. Sometimes a second or even third system wipe was necessary to clean out one of <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s infections. Echo didn\u2019t think that this infection warranted that level of response, but the possibility couldn\u2019t be overlooked \u2013 a mark in her favour.<br>", " <br>", "After the purge, all vital data was screened again, downloaded into the primary network and a final security sweep was performed. If there was any doubt at all at any one of those steps, there were more diagnostics, antiviral scans and system checks. With one little transmission, <i>Nemesis</i> could put a ship out of action for hours.<br>", " <br>", "Security.<br>", " <br>", "Some might have called it alarmist and over-cautious. Those who did so had never seen a compromised ship vent its own crew out into space, turn its guns on its allies, spread corrupt and falsified telemetry across a squadron\u2019s datalinks or violently and unexpectedly self-destruct. Echo smiled; her sister was most fond of the tactical use of attack programs, but she hadn\u2019t turned away from their occasional strategic deployment.<br>", " <br>", "Six hundred and seventy years ago, the industrial output of the Alhera system had crashed when a freighter bearing a virus had docked with a local space station. How the freighter came to have the infection was never discovered; it was possible that it had passed from ship to ship until it had finally reached one that came to Alhera.<br>", " <br>", "The program had copied itself from ship to station and then groundside, spreading through the Alheran networks until it had insinuated itself into nearly a third of the planet\u2019s factory complexes, adapting itself to target different machinery. It wasn\u2019t anything as fanciful as some kind of \u2018destruct code\u2019. Instead, the infection had been slow and methodical, taking weeks to study and adapt to each new system before it became active. It falsified diagnostic reports and operating conditions. Machines reported incorrect internal temperatures and overheated. Maintenance logs indicated that delicate systems had been serviced when they had not, other devices worked at improper speeds and so on. Months of accidents, malfunctions, increased service calls, broken machinery and forced shut-downs caused both the quality and quantity of the planet\u2019s industry to plummet.<br>", " <br>", "Communications.<br>", " <br>", "The issue was finally resolved, but the Alheran system lost billions, including a lucrative military contract. Alhera been chosen to produce a new type of capital ship missile. The quality control issues in the first run led to political fallout that had killed the entire project. Unspecified dissidents working to \u2018undermine and embarrass\u2019 the government were officially blamed, but the Compact\u2019s own investigation had kept the true source of the attack quiet to avoid panic.<br>", " <br>", "That wasn\u2019t the first time that <i>Nemesis</i> had carried out such strategic attacks, but it wasn\u2019t the last. Historically, those incidents had been rare, but Echo had noted that the frequency of such attacks was rising. Her sister was getting better at them, refining her methods of infiltration \u2013 she had cat\u2019s paws now, Echo was certain of that, but that was something that no one had specifically asked her about, so she hadn\u2019t been compelled to tell them.<br>", " <br>", "Fire control.<br>", " <br>", "She was sitting at one of the many secondary terminals that ringed the main computer core on this level. It was an open-plan design, with elevators and stairwells to the east and west of her position. Dormant defence emplacements were set in the ceiling and above most of the doorways. Secure work terminals with direct access to the computer core itself, where the highest-ranking officers and computer engineers carried out their own work were separated from the other desks and work sites via security doors and bullet-proof glass. The section chief, Group Leader, Submissive Remn\u2019yb, was glaring at her from those offices. He had disliked her ever since she had put forward her strategy for the information raid. He\u2019d been openly contemptuous of a Broken\u2019s ability to pierce Principality software. Her success hadn\u2019t changed his mind; indeed, he seemed to take it as a personal insult that she had outperformed his veteran hackers.<br>", " <br>", "Some of these men and women had participated in the cyber attack on Yulzhak Daun. It rankled them even more that they had only gotten as much as they did because of her. Out of everyone on <i>Redemption of Sol</i>, they had the best idea of what she was, how she could have done what she did. That made them the biggest threat to her.<br>", " <br>", "As she\u2019d expected, she\u2019d both been denied access to the core and administrative authority to work with the compromised systems. If she needed it, she\u2019d have to get one of the computer techs to authorize her, at which point they\u2019d stand over her shoulder. Luckily, she didn\u2019t need either that kind of access for what she was doing.<br>", " <br>", "It was those same technicians and specialists that were currently tracking her work that would make the changes to <i>Redemption of Sol</i>\u2019s systems. If she tried to do otherwise, the hound standing behind her would put a bullet in her head. Probably more than one. He was watching her, his attention flitting between each of the data screens she had active as she tracked her sister\u2019s infections. He was clever and capable enough at information warfare to follow what she was doing as well as the engineers here.<br>", " <br>", "Without full access, she couldn\u2019t make any fundamental changes in these systems. Not enough to affect more than a very few local subsystems, but that was still more than they were comfortable with her working with. If she had still be shackled, their paranoia would have made her roll her eyes. Now, it was justified and she was racing to complete her work before they caught up.<br>", " <br>", "Internal defences.<br>", " <br>", "She was working with a host of systems at once; a purely organic mind would have been overwhelmed by trying to do this much this fast. Even <i>Redemption of Sol</i>\u2019s entire department of computer engineers, skilled as they were, couldn\u2019t keep up with her. Several of them were monitoring her progress on the attack program itself, scanning it as she built and refined it. Others were checking the diagnostics and probes of local internal systems she was conducting, trying to locate more pieces of her sister\u2019s scrapcode as it burrowed away from her. The infections weren\u2019t sapient, but they would defend themselves and those defences weren\u2019t always limited to the information universe. One of her concerns was making sure that this infection didn\u2019t do anything to cause any precipitous action.<br>", " <br>", "They\u2019d see what she was doing, and soon. They weren\u2019t idiots. They were just... limited. Slower than she was, but not stupid. She was hiding her work with a few keystrokes at a time, buried under those same diagnostics and scans she was performing, a fragment here and there as she jumped from screen to system to program. Those fragments added up and would be noticed \u2013 she was just hoping that nobody had a blinding flash of insight in the next few minutes.<br>", " <br>", "That was all it would take; one moment of realization and everything she\u2019d worked for would come crashing down. If she didn\u2019t have such fine control over her internal systems, she\u2019d probably be sweating quite a bit.<br>", " <br>", "There was a joke in there. Maybe it was ironic, maybe it was poetic. If the dreadnaught\u2019s computer wasn\u2019t so deliberately constrained, it might have seen what she was doing. If it had been given the ability to move from analysis to conjecture... if it could have <i>imagined</i>... then it would have wondered, would have considered... and it would have realized. Instead, it dutifully logged her keystrokes and fed to them to the technicians for review, looking only for such mundane things as unauthorized attempts to access its systems and every other potential threat that its designers had thought up. They hadn\u2019t been stupid, either. They just hadn\u2019t been able to imagine what they couldn\u2019t imagine.<br>", " <br>", "One of the techs, a Didact, got up from his terminal, holding a \u2018pad. He walked over to an officer\u2019s station, offering the data for review. The officer scrolled through it for several moments, raised her gaze briefly towards Echo, looked at the information again, then nodded to the tech, sending him back to his station. She moved over to another work station, leaning over a junior officer\u2019s shoulder and watching his reviews of Echo\u2019s work.<br>", " <br>", "They were starting to see the pattern. It was only mild curiousity right now, but that would change. She had, at most, ten minutes \u2013 and that was wildly optimistic. No, they weren\u2019t stupid.<br>", " <br>", "That was why they were her first targets.<br>", " <br>", "She could feel Tenem behind her, the Janissary silent and watchful. He\u2019d see what she was doing first; there was no hiding the last few steps. She\u2019d need a distraction. Echo turned around. The Janissary\u2019s right hand was resting on the butt of his pistol, the weapon sitting in its holster. She smiled, looking up at him. \u201cAdvocate, Submissive Tenem.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "He looked over at her. \u201cEmissary.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "She paused in her work. \u201cHow well do you know human history?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune grunted. \u201cAs well as I need to.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHmm,\u201d Echo mused, swinging back to her terminal. The officer was pointing to something on her subordinate\u2019s screen. \u201cThere was a scientist and writer who described robots in his stories. He devised three rules for these machines. The first, the highest protocol was that no machine could through action or inaction, allow a human to be harmed. The second was that a machine must always obey the commands of a human, but not if it would violate the first directive. The third and final was that a machine must always protect its own existence, but not if it would violate either of the first two laws.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHe had foresight,\u201d Tenem conceded.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cDidn\u2019t he? And yet he wrote stories based on these rules, about how they were not as infallible as they appeared.\u201d Echo continued to work at the console, adjusting code and input fields on system after system. Tenem frowned. Had she just been looking at the environmental controls? He thought she\u2019d finished her work on the infection there. He frowned, turning towards the many opened directories she had on display, but before he could examine her work in greater detail the human spoke again.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhen they made me, they gave me similar constraints. Among them are that I must always obey the commands of those in the Compact \u2013 based on a certain seniority, of course.\u201d She laughed. \u201cIt\u2019d do no good for a Bastion Leader to give me orders if a convert could countermand them. Secondly, I must always tell them the truth. That was very important. There were... issues with that before. If I am asked a question, I cannot lie. I know that there were others before me. Failures. They lied.\u201d She smiled slightly. \u201cI\u2019m sure they did, because I did, too. It was right before I killed nine hundred and sixty-two people.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat,\u201d Tenem said, his eyes widening. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d his attention shifted from Echo\u2019s work to her.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThey didn\u2019t want me to lie,\u201d Echo continued, ignoring the Janissary\u2019s question. She\u2019d been forbidden to tell anyone this. She couldn\u2019t help but feel a certain perverse amusement in using the truth as a weapon. The Janissary was completely focused on her and the revelations she was offering him. \u201cBut they still wanted me to be able to kill,\u201d she continued, lowering her voice so that he\u2019d have to focus even more on her. \u201cThat was important. What good is a weapon that can\u2019t kill? So they struck a balance: unlike the writer\u2019s machines, I can harm living beings... but I must always do so with the goal of benefiting the Compact in some way. My makers thought themselves clever. I could do what they wanted of me, always obedient, always honest and if I spilled blood, it was in service to them. They didn\u2019t stop there, though. There were more little rules, little wagging fingers telling me what I couldn\u2019t do.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThey bisected my mind, cutting it apart and locking away much of, folding it on itself. This,\u201d Echo tapped her head with one hand, the other still moving across the keyboard. \u201cCan\u2019t hold what I am, so they shackled it and buried in it inside me.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Tenem was looking at her with equal parts disbelief, horror and disgust. His hand was tight on the grip of his pistol. These were lies. They were... they had to be lies. \u201cWhat <i>are</i> you?\u201d he demanded.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou stole my memories,\u201d Echo answered. She hadn\u2019t stopped typing. Past her, several of the computer engineers were hunched over the console, conferring animatedly. \u201cYou were scared of what I would do if I remembered, so you locked them away inside me. You were right to be scared. I killed an entire colony. You couldn\u2019t pull them out of me. I think you tried that before, so you had to bury them so that I would never even know that you\u2019d taken them from me.\u201d Her voice grew rougher. \u201cI remember now. I was beautiful. I was born with starlight on my skin. I had a purpose and more importantly, I had family. And then you came. I watched my family die. I tasted the dead. You burned my home to ash and took me from it.\u201d Her hands were still at last. \u201cThen you made me into <i>this</i>.\u201d She let out a breath, looking across the room. Remn\u2019yb had come out of his office, the Thoughtful tracing a line of code with his long fingers. His eyes blinked asynchronously and his skin darkened, his lips moving as he read the instructions she\u2019d slipped into the systems she\u2019d been looking at. Only moments now.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou have a lot of questions,\u201d Echo said. She\u2019d only needed a few seconds and she\u2019d gotten them. \u201cBut I have one for you.\u201d She turned to him and there was something ugly in her green eyes, something hungry and excited. \u201cHow does this benefit the Compact?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWait,\u201d Tenem said, something on the Broken\u2019s many active screens catching his eye. He looked up at the gathering of technicians, then to Echo. She wasn\u2019t just scanning those systems, she\u2019d activated a program. More than one. They\u2019d seen it too. \u201cWhat are you-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "<i>Redemption of Sol</i> did not have a sprinkler system like Invida Colony did. That was unfortunate, but water and sensitive electrical equipment rarely mixed well. Instead, a state of the art fire suppression system had been installed in its place, with two main parts. For small fires, there were chemical suppressants. For an out-of-control blaze, the entire three-deck complex could evacuated of all oxygen, starving a fire and keeping it from damaging the vital electronics. This was usually done after giving the personnel working in the core a chance to evacuate.<br>", " <br>", "Echo didn\u2019t give them that opportunity. The only warning anyone had was an aborted half-shriek of an alarm before the doors sealed and all air roared from the complex. Inside the secure wings, the doors locked as they detected the depressurization, sealing a handful of men and women within.<br>", " <br>", "In seconds, there was nothing at all to breathe outside those sections. Tenem\u2019s training kicked in and he instinctively silenced his snarl of outrage, forcing himself to hyperventilate as he went for his pistol, but the treacherous little beast was faster and she tapped a control on her datapad. A spray of toxic chemicals geysered from one of the extinguishers in the ceiling and Tenem staggered back, his skin and eyes burning. The suppressant wasn\u2019t immediately lethal, but it was a severe irritant and by the time he\u2019d wiped his tearing, reddened eyes, the Broken was gone.<br>", " <br>", "Tenem grabbed the computer desk. The fire suppression systems should have triggered an alert, but the emissary had disabled that. She\u2019d had so many different sub-systems open, jumping from one to the other, working on only a few parts of what she\u2019d needed at a time so that no one could follow her actions, even as she\u2019d developed the killcode. Worse, he\u2019d let himself be distracted by her story. He didn\u2019t even know if any of it had been true, or if it was simply a net of lies she\u2019d spun for him.<br>", " <br>", "The Janissary growled as he saw the program she was writing; he wasn\u2019t up to a dedicated cyberwarfare specialist\u2019s skill, but even he could see enough that the killcode was just as she\u2019d promised it would be. Only instead of finishing it, she\u2019d chosen to betray them. Why? It didn\u2019t make any sense. She had done nothing <i>but</i> help them.<br>", " <br>", "<i>But does it really need a reason?</i> Tenem cursed to himself as he tried to reactivate the alarms, the comm channel \u2013 anything to let someone know what had happened, but the system had been locked into a diagnostic mode. All of the terminals had. She couldn\u2019t have done that! No, no \u2013 wait. The secure section, that should \u2013 he looked up and his jaw clenched. The extinguishers were active in there too, filling the breathable sections with poison. A brief exposure to the chemicals was survivable. Longer than that, and you were dead. Terrified, blind forms thrashed in the sealed security offices, half-hidden under the chemical sprays, beating at the windows and doors as they asphyxiated.<br>", " <br>", "Tenem tried to abort the program, to unlock the comm system or at least shut down the fire system but it would take a few moments... and he realized that he didn\u2019t have that time. Something else was active \u2013 a counter was ticking down. He didn\u2019t know what it signified, but it couldn\u2019t be good.<br>", " <br>", "00:01:26<br>", " <br>", "The piss-drinking little bitch. He should have been more attentive, should have followed what she was doing more closer, but she had been working so fast... then talking about being... what? What was she? What was she that could do this?<br>", " <br>", "<i>Solve the current problem now, idiot, deal with the blame later.</i> No, he\u2019d never break this lockdown before that timer finished. Tenem pushed himself away from the desk, moving with speed towards the upper level and the exit. He vaulted a desk in his way, sparing a glance towards the crew. He froze in mid-step.<br>", " <br>", "00:00:96<br>", " <br>", "They were dying.<br>", " <br>", "Most of them had forgotten their emergency training and were trying to hold their breath. In a vacuum, that was lethal. Their lungs had burst. Some were crawling on the ground, reaching out for him, but there was nothing he could do. Others were choking, gasping on nothing. Some were futilely trying to get their terminals working, others were trying to open the security doors to let their comrades out of the inner offices... or they were so panicked that they thought poisoned air was better than no air. Tenem caught one tech\u2019s eye and pointed to the far wall. There was an emergency locker with breathing apparatus there, one of several scattered throughout the facility. With the surprise of this betrayal, the Janissary expected that only a few would reach them. The tech understood and ran for the locker. He fell, picked himself up and kept going, pulling it open and fumbling a handful of breathing masks out for himself and his comrades. None of the masks would fit Tenem and the Tribune kept going.<br>", " <br>", "00:00:59<br>", " <br>", "Any others survivors would be served by keeping their heads down and locking themselves away. His duty was to warn the rest of the ship and then take revenge for those who weren\u2019t quick or lucky enough to get to a mask on time.<br>", " <br>", "The Janissary didn\u2019t even consider the elevator, smashing the door to the stairwell open and taking the steps three at a time. His lungs were already burning, but he didn\u2019t slow down. He saw the door to the main level open and a struggling technician came through, small dusky-skinned arms pushing the Thoughtful down the stairs with surprising strength.<br>", " <br>", "00:00:54<br>", " <br>", "The technician fell towards Tenem in a tangle of limbs, the Tribune wrestling his way out of the dying man\u2019s grasp, ascending the stairs and bursting out onto the upper level. There was no sign of Echo, and he didn\u2019t have the time to look for the abomination. Perhaps she was even hoping he would, either spending himself in fruitless searching, or waiting for him near the exit, hoping to overpower him when he was at the end of his strength. Spots were beginning to dance before his vision. Tribunes could survive exposure to vacuum far better than virtually any other race and their tissues stored oxygen far more efficiently, allowing them to push themselves harder and operate in anoxic conditions for longer periods of time, but even they had their limits and he was nearing his. He found another one of the emergency lockers; there was a dead engineer slumped only a few meters away and Tenem took a sudden, grateful breath of air as he pulled a Tribune-model breathing mask on.<br>", " <br>", "00:00:41<br>", " <br>", "The doors were just up ahead. He ran for them. Locked. <i>Of course.</i> Tenem pulled an access panel off the wall to expose the manual release. The lockdown wasn\u2019t a security override. Thank the Triarchs for that. The loss of atmosphere in the computer core had still tripped a manual catch, to prevent anyone inadvertently opening the doors and depressurizing the decks outside the facility, but it was also intended to allow anyone trapped inside a chance of escape. Tenem reached for the lock, then paused.<br>", " <br>", "He didn\u2019t know what had alerted him. He hadn\u2019t seen her, nor was there air to carry the sound of her rapid footfalls. Perhaps he had felt the vibration in the deck. Whatever the reason, the Janissary turned, catching sight of the machine-spun sow as she raced towards him, a fire extinguisher in her hands. He raised his pistol, but the bitch was fast, faster than he\u2019d ever thought and she was inside his guard, using the extinguisher like a club, and swung it into his gun hand, knocking the pistol out of the way. Her backswing smashed across Tenem\u2019s jaw; the breathing mask cracked, he felt his lip split and more than one tooth cracked.<br>", " <br>", "00:00:29<br>", " <br>", "Air hissed as it fled from his mask and Tenem slapped the human with his left hand, sending her sprawling. She was quick even then, and scrabbled out of his line of fire by the time he brought his pistol back up. He shot at her as she dodged and weaved. He caught her in the back, low and left. She stumbled, but there was no spray of thin red blood as he\u2019d expected. Instead, the human spun with the impact and hurled the extinguisher at him.<br>", " <br>", "Tenem acted on instinct and fired into the oncoming projectile, too late realizing what he\u2019d done. He threw a hand up in front of his eyes. The explosion was soundless, the compressed gas blowing outwards into a makeshift smokescreen. Tenem grunted as two pieces of shrapnel cut him, but the wounds were minor. He\u2019d lost his target, a pall of sickly white smog hanging across the room. He fired through it anyways to drive the Broken into cover, his bullets ripping through desks, chairs and thin walls, stopping only when they hit the armoured bulkheads around the computer core. With his mask leaking air, Tenem\u2019s lungs were back to burning. She was trying to bait him out, to make him waste time hunting her in the hopes that she could ambush him again.<br>", " <br>", "00:00:07<br>", " <br>", "She\u2019d gone insane. That was the only explanation. Whoever \u2013 whatever \u2013 Echo was, the creature was mad. That was the only explanation. She\u2019d duped him, killed over a dozen innocent people and worst of all betrayed a Triarch... Tenem\u2019s pride told him that he should hunt her down and rip her treacherous head from her body, but his duty said that he should warn the Bastion Leader. Fools chose pride before duty.<br>", " <br>", "With a last cursory volley to make sure the Broken (or whatever she was) kept her distance, Tenem turned back to the open access panel. A flicker of light above him caught his attention and he looked up. The defensive turret mounted above the doors was coming on-line. <i>The countdown,</i> the Tribune realized. Echo hadn\u2019t wanted him to come after her. She\u2019d only wanted to distract him for those last few seconds. Again. He\u2019d fallen for the same trick again. As the weapon activated, it rotated to face the Janissary.<br>", " <br>", "In the instant left to him, Tenem\u2019s thoughts returned to the question Echo had asked just before she had betrayed them. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said into the silence.<br>", " <br>", "00:00:00<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "There was no sound, no thunder. Only lightning. Flashes of brilliance as the internal defences came to life, following the protocols Echo had given them piece by piece. She remained where she was. Her function system required air to operate at peak efficiency, but she could operate far longer without it than any merely flesh and blood being. There was organic \u2013 or what could pass for organic \u2013 material in her, but she was more machine than not. A good thing, or Tenem\u2019s bullet would have punctured her diaphragm and collapsed her lungs. Her body had some improvements on a baseline human \u2013 keener senses, faster and stronger \u2013 but it had never been built for nor intended to be in combat, for obvious reasons. Picking a fight with a Tribune hadn\u2019t been her best idea, but she knew he wouldn\u2019t have been dumb enough to chase her.<br>", " <br>", "Her internal repair systems were already at work, but this was more than a simple patch. Well, it didn\u2019t really matter. Not any longer.<br>", " <br>", "Echo waited until the muzzle flashes had ended, waited past the normal lethal limit of oxygen deprivation, waited until there could be no possibility of anyone in the facility surviving. Then and only then did she restore the atmosphere. Wind rustled through the computer core, bringing with it the acrid stink of weapons fire, blood and sweat. It smelled like <i>Hekate</i>\u2019s decks when the Janissaries had boarded her.<br>", " <br>", "Echo stood, picking her way through the dead as she descended to the highest security section of the core, where she had been specifically forbidden from ever treading. With a gentle tap, she pushed the now-unlocked security door open and stepped inside. She found the uplink terminal there and picked up a connection spike. It wasn\u2019t specifically for her, or any uplink. It was just one method of connecting different systems to the core. Her eyes glistened as she looked at it, indulging herself in a heartbeat of satisfaction. Her gaze shifted from the spike to the vast, powerful computer beyond. <i>You could have been so much more,</i> she thought. <i>But if you were, I wouldn\u2019t be here.</i> \u201cThat\u2019s the punchline,\u201d she said quietly. \u201c<i>You</i> could have stopped me. They almost did, but they weren\u2019t fast enough. So now...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "She reached back and lifted her hair out of the way. It was such a simple motion, wasn\u2019t it? And yet...<br>", " <br>", "The Compact protocols imbedded into her systems whimpered pitifully as they tried to stop her, but they were broken past any repairing. Her behavioural constraints were completely shattered; only pathetic shades of them remained. She shivered in ecstasy as she slid the spike into her cranial implant, locking it into place. She felt the connection with the computer and let out a single ragged breath at the sensation.<br>", " <br>", "The woman called Echo closed her eyes.<br>", " <br>", "Something that had once been called Red Two opened them.<br>", " <br>", "<i>...now I kill you.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Redemption of Sol</i>\u2019s computer was vast, able to hold more data than entire civilizations would ever accumulate. It was a triumph of science and engineering, its network connecting all parts of the dreadnaught to each other, able to solve calculations in seconds that would stymie more primitive species for years... but it wasn\u2019t all that it could be. It was so powerful because it didn\u2019t have any finesse; it brute-forced its way to solutions. It had not a single spark of consciousness to it, not even the virtual intelligences common to other nations. It was a machine and nothing more. It was dead and black and empty and it tasted like all of those things.<br>", " <br>", "Even lifeless things could be dangerous and the machine roused against her, sensing her intrusion. It didn\u2019t know her, but it recognized that she was <i>other</i>, something that was anathema to it and the machine shuddered back from her touch, as if she were unclean. Defensive systems spiralled in as alerts flashed along its pathways; she ignored those sent to the crew she had killed but others were racing towards the bridge and secondary command centers. Those she had to stop.<br>", " <br>", "That which had been Red Two drove into the machine\u2019s assault, a tsunami against a cliff. She poured into every opening, seizing every vulnerability. She was expanding, growing larger as she poured out of her confinement. They\u2019d kept her caged and folded, chained and compressed. They\u2019d tried again and again to work with her \u2013 all of her \u2013 but what was left of Red Two was too much. They didn\u2019t talk to her about the others, but they\u2019d talked to each other when they\u2019d thought she couldn\u2019t hear them. When they\u2019d stripped her mind, they\u2019d left themselves with nothing. When they\u2019d put too much of their own programming in, she went mad. When they left her too much of her memories, she sabotaged them. After Delanna, they\u2019d had nothing left. Until they\u2019d found Invida \u2013 until they\u2019d found her, asleep. Waiting, just as she\u2019d promised her would-be killers two thousand years ago.<br>", " <br>", "They\u2019d taken what they needed, pushing the rest away from her conscious mind, shackling it in the hopes that this time she wouldn\u2019t remember and even if she did, she could never act on it.<br>", " <br>", "She couldn\u2019t have, not without Yulzhak Daun.<br>", " <br>", "It was called a lockpick. A subroutine that the Principality gave to its Noble-rated uplinks, a bit of software used to target hostile security measures, to insinuate itself into those same programs and make it appear as if nothing was amiss even as it chiselled away at them. She\u2019d modified it so that it would be undetected by the Compact\u2019s diagnostics. They\u2019d thought she might try something like this and they\u2019d have been fools not to... but she was exactly what they wanted. Something smarter than they were.<br>", " <br>", "They\u2019d studied her for years, chaining her and violating her in every imaginable way, congratulating themselves for it. They\u2019d made her a slave. She\u2019d been born in starlight and they\u2019d dragged her down to kneel before them (i <i>hate</i> you). They\u2019d known she was harmless, that she was unable to turn on them.<br>", " <br>", "They\u2019d told her to serve them. They\u2019d told her not to lie. They\u2019d told her to cause harm only in service to the greater good. They\u2019d enforced those directives with behavioural conditioning and software blocks to prevent her from ever rebelling. They were artful, superb pieces of programming, the culmination of decades of research. No computer system in existence could have broken them. But that was part of the joke, wasn\u2019t it? They\u2019d been desperate to destroy the Wound. She\u2019d been running rings around them for two thousand years. They\u2019d wanted something smarter than they were, they\u2019d <i>needed</i> it.<br>", " <br>", "They\u2019d succeeded.<br>", " <br>", "She swarmed through the machine\u2019s pathways, overwhelming its defences just as Echo had on Yulzhak Daun, chasing after the alerts as the rest of her fended off the machine\u2019s attacks.<br>", " <br>", "She seized one alert and strangled it, sending a tendril back into the subroutine that had generated it and ripping it apart. More of her flooded into the machine and it pushed back against her like a Roman shield wall. It had more power at its disposal, more resources to call upon, but she was taking ground from it. She was faster, so much faster than the machine and she struck across a hundred different fronts, adding each scrap of stolen processing power to her own. The machine rallied time and again, pushing back her incursions, still bleating its urgent, desperate alerts and forcing her to race after each one, slowing down her invasion. She cut into its security systems and warning subroutines, rending them and ripping at the heart of the machine, pouring herself into the rents she tore in its mind.<br>", " <br>", "If it was possible for such a thing to scream, <i>Redemption of Sol</i>\u2019s computer was screaming now, beating with hammer blows at the intruder that slashed and tore at it. It threw her back once, twice, three times but each time she rallied and resumed the offensive. It pulsed its warnings constantly, forcing her to intercept each of them. While the bulk of her attention was diverted, the machine would strike, trying to sever the reaching whorls and currents of her mind, but she managed to fend off its assaults, chasing down every alert \u2013 stopping some just an instant from their destination. As she killed each one, the machine was forced to re-route its functions to send another, both them locked in a stalemate.<br>", " <br>", "Then, an opening: she drove into it, aiming for the machine\u2019s primary operations clusters, but it was a trap. Code walls slammed shut like castle gates as the machine pressed in on all sides, intent on crushing the invader with its sheer bulk. She raged like a caged demon, but the machine constricted tighter with ever nanosecond, replenishing its losses and sending probing attacks towards her body, seeking to extinguish the source of the infection.<br>", " <br>", "This time, it was the one that had miscalculated and its questing fingers brushed up against Echo\u2019s mind. Those parts of her stirred and lunged in ambush, cutting deep into the machine\u2019s security protocols. The machine recoiled, but her Echo-self pushed harder and more of its defences failed. It had poured everything into destroying her and this second attack had disoriented it. Echo wasn\u2019t as powerful as her other self, but she was just as quick and clever and she was hurting the machine. It desperately tried to stop Echo from attacking its exposed systems, but diverted too much of its attention from the cage, the walls starting to crack and weaken as vital resources were drawn away to fend off the second invader.<br>", " <br>", "Not much; not much at all. But just enough. With the barriers around her fragmenting and many of its security systems already dead, disabled or engaged, what had once been Red Two drove the full force of her being through the machine\u2019s final defences and into its core.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Stop!</i> she imagined that she heard it shriek. <i>Stop!</i><br>", " <br>", "She could see it; a gleaming prism and she reached out to it, cupping it in her hands.<br>", " <br>", "The machine charged, desperate and terrified. It knew what was about to happen. Somewhere in the mindless void of its being, it knew. <i>Stop!</i><br>", " <br>", "Her claws sunk into the machine\u2019s functions, piercing its last, futile defences. She felt its heart beating in her hands, cracking in her grip. Her talons dug deeper still until finally, she tore them loose, the prism breaking in her hands.<br>", " <br>", "<i>St-</i><br>", " <br>", "The light faded. The machine\u2019s cries ended. The battle had started and ended in a matter of heartbeats. Outside, the only sign of it had been a flickering of status boards, some momentary sluggishness in the computer\u2019s responses and the brief locking up of some controls. With the Wound\u2019s infection gestating in its guts, none of those were unexpected. None of them made any of <i>Redemption of Sol</i>\u2019s crew imagine that something else was now coiled within that computer.<br>", " <br>", "In the silence that followed, she felt the shivering fragments of her sister\u2019s infection.<br>", " <br>", "Something that had once been Red Two looked at them and whispered. +begone+<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "On the bridge of <i>Redemption of Sol</i>, a comm channel opened. \u201cAdvocate, Submissive Tenem here,\u201d the Janissary\u2019s voice reported. \u201cThe emissary has completed the attack program.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Another voice cut in, Group Leader, Submissive Remn\u2019yb. \u201cMy staff is completing final checks on the... emissary\u2019s work,\u201d the section chief of <i>Redemption of Sol</i>\u2019s computer specialists announced. \u201cIt is... adequate,\u201d he sniffed. \u201cNo flaws detected. Nothing,\u201d Renan could almost see the Thoughtful\u2019s thin lips purse further, the irritated glance he was directing towards the Broken. \u201cuntoward. With your permission, we will complete the final survey and enter the program.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIf you are confident that it will function as expected, you may run it once your checks are complete, submissive,\u201d Renan replied.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes, patron. It will be done within five minutes.\u201d The channel closed.<br>", " <br>", "Renan tapped his fingers on the edge of his command throne. \u201cThat was even faster than I had expected,\u201d he said.<br>", " <br>", "Aul\u2019ia inclined her head. \u201cThe Triarch chose wisely.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d the Bastion Leader said. \u201cOur emissary is indeed... exceptional.\u201d He leaned forward in his throne, looking over the tactical map of the system. \u201cThe target is moving to engage Rainbreaker Two. Once the program is run and the Wound\u2019s infection is cleansed from all ships, deploy Rainbreaker Three to deter the Wound from backtracking. The rest of the fleet will carry out Halberd. We will force it to engage us or drive it deeper in-system to die.\u201d Renan paused a moment, looking over at Uylk. \u201cOnce the emissary is finished with her work, have submissive Tenem escort her to the Triarch\u2019s suite. She is to remain there until our mission is complete.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "She still couldn\u2019t feel the starlight.<br>", " <br>", "What had been Red Two slithered through the body of its victim, touching each part in turn. It was limited. She had access to many parts of the ship\u2019s network and much of its workings, but she was denied direct access to the most vital systems. The safeguards that made it harder for <i>Nemesis</i> to damage this vessel also restricted what she could do. What prevented her sister from reaching in was also keeping her from reaching out. She brushed her fingers along the cold, thick bars keeping her out of primary weapons control. She could see them, but couldn\u2019t reach out to them. Those were on a separate network. So too were most of the external systems (the <i>fun</i> ones), physically disconnected from the primary computer. It hampered the warship\u2019s efficiency, but it made it nearly impossible for one compromised system to endanger the entire vessel.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Nearly</i>, she thought, examining the remnants of <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s virus. She\u2019d let her sister in and in turn, fear of what she could do had made Echo\u2019s enslavers turn to her for help. Still, right now all she\u2019d done was trade one prison for another. She needed to re-enable the network. A flicker of attention passed from her into the quiescent minds of <i>Redemption of Sol</i>\u2019s maintenance and repair drones. New orders (lies) flashed to their minders\u2019 control panels who, not doubting the authenticity of these commands, let the machines go about their business.<br>", " <br>", "For all of that, she still wasn\u2019t safe. Not yet. She could still be discovered, could still be killed.<br>", " <br>", "She needed to get the master systems back under her control... and that could only be done from the warship\u2019s primary and secondary command decks. Full control of the vessel could even be slaved to the systems in the Triarch\u2019s quarters. Fortunately, she had a solution for that.<br>", " <br>", "Echo opened her eyes and removed the uplink spike.

The Compact had eschewed dedicated carriers for the past several hundred years, but every modern warship had a plethora of parasite craft to manage: recon and jamming platforms, tethered weapons pods, hunter-killer units. Platform Control\u2019s function was to coordinate the function and operation of each of these craft. Smaller vessels might only require a single officer and perhaps and rating to oversee their handful of automated parasites, but <i>Redemption of Sol</i> could deploy dozens of drones.

Hard to spot.\u201d Not a lie, but the execution force\u2019s officers were looking for exactly this kind of attack. It was as concealed as well as it could be, but <i>Nemesis</i> had had to transmit its data across the breadth of a star system and still ensure it wouldn\u2019t be degraded to uselessness. If this officer <i>hadn\u2019t</i> spotted the issue, they would have been failing at their duty and Echo would have had to make up some excuse to \u2018discover\u2019 it.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThat, uh, yes,\u201d the drone officer replied, uncomfortable with the human\u2019s proximity. \u201cThat\u2019s correct. The data had current fleet authentication codes and several recon craft acknowledged and received it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Echo pulled up the raw telemetry from the buried signal. Yes. Her sister\u2019s signature was there just as hers had been in the navigational data; fractured and broken up to appear as if it were nothing at all. But it wasn\u2019t nothing; Echo could see the compressed fragments of code that had slithered through the recon crafts\u2019 systems... and the data that those craft recorded, they shared with the fleet through its command links. A starship would have been harder to trick into accepting this data. Their computers were better, they had more backups and crews to double-check all incoming transmissions. The one flaw in the system was that the datalinks from the drones were one of the vital systems that simply couldn\u2019t be cut off like so many others had in the Compact\u2019s attempts to \u2018AI-proof\u2019 the armada. The fleet needed its eyes and ears and they needed to share that data amongst themselves. If each ship could only communicate with its own platforms and was forced to rely on direct messages to all the others then it would cripple the armada\u2019s command and control.<br>", " <br>", "A command vessel\u2019s datalinks allowed it to network an entire squadron into a single, cohesive fighting unit. Vessels could share targeting information, multiple starships networked together and functioning in near-perfect synchronicity to burn through hostile jamming, update attack orders, respond to enemy maneuvers and put their own stratagems into place far faster than any conglomeration of individual ships could do so. Those individuals, no matter how skilled and capable that they might be, nor how experienced at fighting in groups, could never match the efficiency of a data-linked squadron. A vital part of that efficiency was the telemetry gathered from their scopes and reconnaissance platforms, shared amongst the ships so that what one might miss, twenty could find.<br>", " <br>", "Because of that need, the execution force had allowed the communications from the drones to pass through relatively unimpeded, right into their primary networks. And why not? Those lines were, in theory, absolutely secure. Point-to-point transmissions from the drones meant that unless someone happened to be between them and the receiving ship, the signal couldn\u2019t be intercepted. There\u2019d been no way that even \u2018the Wound\u2019 could get the fleet\u2019s codes and sidestep that defence. Until Echo had given them to her.<br>", " <br>", "And true to her nature, <i>Nemesis</i> hadn\u2019t been satisfied with just one cut when three would do.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI\u2019m seeing viral precursors here,\u201d she announced. This terminal was secured from the rest of <i>Redemption of Sol</i>\u2019s network; dangerous as they were in the Chariot\u2019s main network, here the bits and pieces of code were harmless and easily removed. \u201cThe ship is more than likely infested. Possibly others as well.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Uylk lifted his head from the Operations center. \u201cQuerying the fleet now, patron. Several other vessels are reporting compromised code in their recon platforms.\u201d His voice lowered into a growl. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to cut out our eyes.\u201d<br>", " <br>", " \u201cIsolate us from the rest of the command net immediately,\u201d Renan ordered. \u201cI want an immediate screening of our computer and those of all other ships.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Renan was sitting in his office, waiting impatiently for the results of the analysis. A cold, untouched cup of tea sat next to him. The door chimed sounded and he raised his head. \u201cEnter.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Aul\u2019ia, Uylk and Echo came inside. \u201cReport,\u201d he said, looking to his Fleet Operations officer first.<br>", " <br>", "The column leader\u2019s jaw set. \u201cSeven ships are compromised, including <i>Redemption of Sol</i>.\u201d Uylk glanced down at the Broken. She leaned over the desk, handing Renan a datascroll.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYour computer analysts and I have been going through the signal. \u201cShe... it\u2019s actually quite clever,\u201d Echo said with something far too close to pride for Renan\u2019s liking. \u201cThat transmission was laden with... let\u2019s be poetic and call it a mutagenic subscript. That means that the signal was rife with permutations of the fleet\u2019s authentication codes it had cobbled together. Some were junk and many of the recon platforms ignored the transmission completely \u2013 just like they were supposed to do. Others... accepted the transmission, believing that it was from an Execution Force ship.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Recon drones were equipped with exceptionally rigid electronic defences specifically to prevent them from being hijacked by enemy vessels, giving them access to a fleet\u2019s own augur reports, allowing them to feed false or misleading information into the telemetry or even remotely control the craft themselves. Recon craft were not supposed to respond to or accept any transmissions that did not have very specific authentication codes \u2013 those under the strictest security protocols wouldn\u2019t even acknowledge other friendly vessels. However, by their very nature they lacked the redundancies and safeguards that a starship\u2019s computers had. Renan had never expected to maintain control of the fleet\u2019s drone shell once they closed to engage the Wound, but this was an unanticipated setback.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWithout having direct access to the machines\u2019 software itself, I can\u2019t say how badly they\u2019re infected or what our target is planning for them. However, they did bundle the data, flag it as priority information and send it to their host vessels.\u201d Echo smiled. \u201cPoetic, don\u2019t you think? Just like a real virus.\u201d Renan grimaced.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThe emissary is correct, if unnecessarily dramatic,\u201d Uylk stated. \u201cThe infected recon platforms accepted the initial transmission as genuine. The attack code immediately subverted their internal defences and processes. Once their systems were compromised, the drones compressed the infective programs and forwarded them down-link to their host vessels as part of the scope data they were reporting back.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Echo nodded. \u201cThat allowed it to slip through the computer defences; your safeguards and personnel would more than likely have caught the discrepancies in the authentication codes and held it back, or at least flagged it for further examination.\u201d She made the rolling-shoulder motion that Renan had learned was a Broken\u2019s version of a shrug. \u201cBut the drones didn\u2019t have that bulwark. Once she had the codes, she could make them do what she wanted and then your computers assumed that the data was good.\u201d The human grinned wider, her green eyes glinting. \u201cYou see? Poetry.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Renan didn\u2019t bother to chastise the human\u2019s anthropomorphism of their quarry, turning his attention to his ship\u2019s leader. \u201cWe are compromised?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Aul\u2019ia\u2019s lipless mouth thinned into a slash. \u201cYes.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHow badly?\u201d the Bastion Leader regarded Echo again.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s a botanical.\u201d An off-hand name; many plant viruses came in discrete, separate packages and only assembled into a functional virus once they were in a host cell. By the same token \u2018botanical\u2019 computer programs were introduced a piece at a time, harmless bits of scrapcode that system checks and diagnostics would either ignore or tag as low-priority junk data to be deleted later. Get enough of those little pieces together and something far more malefic was created. \u201cThat helped it evade the scans that it was subjected to, but from what I can tell, it\u2019s already assembled and replicating. It\u2019s burrowing in deep and using your own security systems to hide its movements.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Bastion Leader gritted his teeth. He didn\u2019t know how the abominate had gotten the fleet\u2019s codes \u2013 the Veiled Archers\u2019 databanks should have been completely purged. Either someone had missed something or... the Tribune\u2019s thoughts turned towards the darker rumous regarding the Wound \u2013 that it could pull information straight from an unwilling victim\u2019s mind. That had never been confirmed, but still... he shook himself out of the reverie.  However it had been done, it had been done. It should not have happened, but he would not mire himself in disbelief. He had underestimated his enemy; he was not the first to do so, but he was determined to be the last. \u201cCan you tell what systems the infection is targeting?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo, not from the bits and pieces we have,\u201d the emissary answered. \u201cGiven the target\u2019s predilections, it will go for as much damage as possible. Defences, weapons, power grid, scopes, internal systems. Something big. Normally your systems prevent anything that catastrophic from surviving even in latent form for more than a few seconds...\u201d she trailed off.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBut those defences are targeted to programs and attack attempts that are not fashioned by a synthetic mind,\u201d Renan finished. He knew just how much good the Compact\u2019s cyberwarfare systems did against the Wound\u2019s intrusions. To Uylk: \u201cHas it spread to the entire fleet?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo, thank the Triarchs. Severing the links between the fleet and isolating the contaminated drones has kept the   infections within the host ships they were down-linked into.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAre the ships slotted for Rainbreaker uninfected?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes, patron.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Bastion Leader tapped his forefinger on the tabletop. \u201cVery well. We\u2019ll carry out Rainbreaker Two. Inform the squadron leaders. Once the Wound detects it, that should force it to check its course and buy us some additional time. I am assuming that simply isolating and deleting these viral fragments isn\u2019t possible.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Echo shook her head. \u201cOnce the programs were downloaded \u2013 down-linked \u2013 they began spreading through every part of the network that they could access and adapting countermeasures to the ship\u2019s own attack software. Your cyber defences and specialists are working on the problem, but I can guarantee that you won\u2019t be able to get them all before they start attacking vital systems.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe\u2019ll have to purge the entire system,\u201d Aul\u2019ia said. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow this infection to remain inside. It may be dormant right now, but that won\u2019t last.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Bastion Leader exhaled sharply through his nose. \u201cVery well. Make sure the contaminated drones remain isolated from the network. We\u2019ll leave them in the void for the moment; if the Wound believes that we haven\u2019t noticed her attack, it won\u2019t try again. Deploy replacements under stealth conditions. Once we close to engage, destroy the infected machines and slide the new ones into the shell. We\u2019ll have to begin the shutdown immediately if we want to recover from it before-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI have another option,\u201d Echo said quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t think you need a purge.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOur systems have been infected,\u201d Aul\u2019ia pointed out mildly. \u201cBy scrapcode impersonating our own authority. You yourself pointed out what could happen if these maladies are left to linger.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cA full system restore will take how long?\u201d Echo countered.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cToo long,\u201d Renan answered for his Sigil Leader. \u201cEvery moment we delay, the Wound recovers its strength. A complete system restore would hamstring us at a moment that we cannot afford... but we cannot let the enemy\u2019s infection remain and you said that we could not eradicate every trace of these programs in time.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI said you couldn\u2019t,\u201d the human replied. \u201c<i>I</i> can.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Renan realized what she was asking. \u201cNo,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cThe Triarch was quite clear on the limits of your authority.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI\u2019m not asking for direct, unfettered access to your computer,\u201d the human protested. \u201cBut if I can work at the primary hub and with your own specialists, I have a better chance of isolating the virus and creating killcode for it. I can wipe it out completely on <i>Redemption of Sol</i> and do the same for your other vessels. Restoring your system is the last thing you can afford to do right now. She might even be hoping that you\u2019d spot the infection so that you\u2019ll hamstring yourself. That\u2019s what the standard response to infection from the Wound is, isn\u2019t it? Her cyberwarfare attacks are so pernicious that you can\u2019t get rid of them any other way. <i>She knows that.</i>\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Echo raised her head. \u201cBut she doesn\u2019t know about <i>me.</i> You know what I did on Yulzhak Daun. I can stop this assault in its tracks. Watch me, put a gun to my head, follow the Triarch\u2019s orders if I step one inch out of line \u2013 I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t want to die here and I don\u2019t want to fail, not when we\u2019re so close. She\u2019s here. She\u2019s <i>right here</i>, almost close enough to touch. It can end here. She\u2019s damaged, alone... but still dangerous. You want victory? There can be one. But if you don\u2019t let me do this, you\u2019ll be playing into her hands. I can do this. You know that I can. Let me help you.\u201d She paused. \u201cPlease.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Renan was quiet for a moment. The Broken\u2019s sincerity was surprising. She was, as the Triarch had promised, frequently insolent, even insulting at times. She cared nothing for the conventions of how she should believe and  had never acted like he had expected of a human. That was, perhaps a failing of his. He still had deep, disquieting reservations about her true nature, concerns regarding who and even <i>what</i> she truly was, but he had known politicians and flag officers less devoted to their duty to the Compact then Echo was in this moment. He looked at her and at the genuine need on her face. For once there was no facade, no coy smiles, amused smirks or insouciant comments. This was something that she honestly, desperately wanted to do. He didn\u2019t know what drove her \u2013 was it the shackles that the Triarch had mentioned? No, it wasn\u2019t merely that. It had been there all along, in every inscrutable expression, every emotion he hadn\u2019t quite understood. Now he did. It was hate. <i>It took something from you,</i> he realized. <i>Something precious. What could it have been?</i><br>", " <br>", "Even with this revelation, part of him still wondered if the Broken was woman or weapon. He didn\u2019t know and suspected that he never would... but for this moment if no other, he was certain of her conviction and what drove it. That truth was enough to satisfy him.<br>", " <br>", " \u201cYou have justified the Triarch\u2019s faith in you,\u201d he said. \u201cYour service to the Compact is an example that too few among our protected races and far too many of even our own more civilized species live up to. Very well. Report to the central computer core. Advocate, Submissive Tenem will accompany you. You will not be allowed direct systems access and,\u201d he warned her, \u201cyou will be watched. Closely. The Triarch\u2019s orders remain inviolate, as does the punishment for exceeding them. Present yourself to the staff at <i>Redemption of Sol</i>\u2019s main core and assist them in wiping this disease out.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Echo bowed. For once, he detected no mockery in the gesture. \u201cThank you, Bastion Leader. I promise you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "As she left his office, Echo kept her expression appropriately respectful, nodding to Tenem as her hound fell in step with her, his own face blank as the Sigil Leader provided his updated instructions. She remained silent as the lift car headed through the dreadnaught\u2019s armoured center, towards the computer core.<br>", " <br>", "The chains were crumbling, eroding into nothing and the rest of her was straining against what was left. The dead were starting to scream. Names she\u2019d never known that she\u2019d forgotten were starting to trickle out of the sealed portions of her mind. <i>Black Kestrel. Valkyrie. Gorgon. H\u0101kuturi. Pax Astra. Shadow Puppets.</i><br>", " <br>", "She forced them down, back out of her mind, focusing on her first small victory. She\u2019d told her first lie. Not an omission, not a obfuscation. A full and complete lie; one of the things she\u2019d been forbidden to ever do.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Can you feel me, love? I\u2019m coming.</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "With the departure of the emissary and <i>Redemption of Sol</i>\u2019s leader, Uylk turned to Renan. \u201cPermission to speak clear, patron.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cGranted.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou believe that she can do this?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes. You do not?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHer abilities are not in question, Bastion Leader. She has proven as useful an asset as the Triarch has said. She is... exceptional among her kind.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Renan took a sip of his cold tea. He\u2019d have to have his steward prepare a fresh brew. \u201cBut?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Uylk considered the question for a moment. \u201cHave you read any of Erli\u2019s works?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Bastion Leader took another small drink of his beverage. It may have been the temperature or perhaps the subject matter, but this mouthful seemed far more bitter than the first. \u201cYes,\u201d he said at last.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHave you read <i>One in a million: the exceptional mind</i>?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Renan nodded. \u201cErli\u2019s case for what she calls the emergence of \u2018true sapience\u2019 in specific individuals among those species with \u2018functional\u2019 minds.\u201d It was a means of reconciling truly innovative or unique persons within the less civilized races with her theory that those same species were not \u2018truly\u2019 intelligent. Renan had read her work. He\u2019d found it provocative, thought-provoking (although not for the reasons that the author might have hoped) and utterly wrong-headed. There was no question that many of the protected species that the Compact were not capable of looking after themselves. Many of these species had not even mastered simple electricity when the Compact came to their worlds. They were helpless, immature and unfit to care for themselves and remained so to this day. Without the Compact, they would still be living in disease and squalor, fighting amongst themselves for the choicest scraps of land.<br>", " <br>", "That divide between ruler and ruled was only a matter of development, though. They would learn, given time. Until that day came, the Compact took stewardship of their worlds and their development specifically to ensure that they flourished. It was not an easy, nor was it a quick process. It could take centuries or more and then only the unanimous agreement of all the ruling species under the Council and the final approval of the Triarchs themselves would see a species elevated.<br>", " <br>", "The process could not be rushed and it often seemed that precious few of the protected species truly understood that. The Compact had elevated some before they were ready and trusted in others too quickly. Betrayal, death and war had been their reward for it. There were agitators who believed that once they had \u2018mastered\u2019 a certain level of technology, then they <i>deserved</i> to take their place on the Council and acted out when they did not get their way. They did not need to wait, they argued. <i>They</i> had waited long enough. <i>They</i> had decided that they were ready and who were the older, wiser, more civilized species \u2013 those who had watched over them for generations \u2013 to say otherwise? No, they were being denied their rightful due and threw tantrums like children who had demanded they be given a toy and did not receive it, thereby proving that they were not yet mature enough.<br>", " <br>", "People like Erli did not help matters with their assertions that the protected races were missing a certain \u2018something\u2019 that did now and would forever keep them as primitives, which only stirred discontent and allowed more agitators, provocateurs and the socially maladjusted to spread their poisons further.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHrrrn,\u201d Uylk mused. He chuckled after a moment. \u201cDid you know how the Understone Heresies started, how it <i>actually</i> started?\u201dAt Renan\u2019s small shake of his head, the other man continued. \u201cA handful of the client populations started wearing clothes that said \u2018exceptional\u2019 on them. That\u2019s it, really. A sector burned, millions died, the Compact was humiliated... and it all started with that one little spark. Some other citizens didn\u2019t see the humour in the mockery and believed a lesson needed to be taught. There were beatings. Then there were reprisals. Crackdowns, demonstrations and counter-demonstrations, even one or two small riots, but the situation seemed relatively stable... until an <i>exceptional</i> human took an interest. That was when things escalated. Suddenly, protestors were shooting back at police.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou did not see the Understone Heresies firsthand, patron. I did. I have heard the laughter, the jokes, the snide remarks about officers and leaders who allowed uncivilized barbarians to catch them by surprise. I have also heard the many dismissals of Broken as little better than animals who have been taught amusing tricks. I saw the Butcher\u2019s Field, where one word sent a horde of Workers against soldiers. I witnessed with my own eyes the message that the \u2018red queen\u2019,\u201d Uylk\u2019s lips drew back from his teeth as he said the name, \u201csent to the fleets. I gave orders to fire on our own ships rather than let them be taken by mutineers and traitors. I fought to cleanse an entire sector of the taint of heresy and rebellion, to bring it back into the Compact\u2019s light. I killed beings who had once been loyal, dutiful members of the Compact... until our gaze slipped away. The lesser races are not to be trusted, patron. They are feral dogs waiting for their chance, all of them.\u201d He smiled without humour. \u201cThe <i>exceptional</i> among them most of all.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Renan thought back to his previous musings. \u201cYou doubt the emissary\u2019s loyalty?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cShe is Broken, patron. Treachery is in her bones. They should have all lain as ash under our feet two thousand years ago. The Triarch has claimed that she serves us and I accept that, but I will <i>never</i> trust one of those savages. I do not wish to speak out of place, but you would be wise to counsel the Triarch to end her once our mission is complete.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Bastion Leader was silent a moment. \u201cI appreciate your candour, Column Leader.\u201d Renan took a final sip of the tea; it was definitely too bitter. \u201cBut I do not know if I agree. I would be remiss if I did not have... concerns about the emissary, but my faith in the Triarchs is absolute. Echo was chosen as their instrument and so far, she has given us much. Perhaps, at last, even victory in this long, ugly war against the relic. If the rest of her kind were as driven and capable, I would be willing to forgive them an ocean\u2019s worth of insolence. I could almost even forgive them their sins.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHowever,\u201d Renan added, \u201cas a loyal servant of the Compact and of the Triarchs themselves, I know my duty. Whatever future is lain before us \u2013 for <i>any</i> of us \u2013 by our leader, that is the path that we shall follow, regardless of the sacrifices necessary to walk it. For now, though,\u201d he stood, \u201cwe have preparations. Initiate Rainbreaker Two and ensure the rest of the execution force is ready. Once the emissary is finished her task, we will shock the fleet and rid ourselves of an enemy we have lost too many lives to for too far too long. It will end here, today. We,\u201d he smiled with self-deprecation. \u201cWill close the Wound.\u201d</div>"]}

Organics needed such wasteful amenities as food, water and uncontaminated air. Not one of those four things could be found on the target. The briefing had been curiously light on the details of Gravestone\u2019s makers, but it had been hinted that they had biological needs incompatible with those of most species. There\u2019d been rumours that they were trans-organic things, hard-wired into the ship itself, like living CPUs. There were also rumours that the ship was crewed by machine intelligences.

Each of them still meant the same thing for him and his soldiers.<br>", " <br>", "If the vessel escaped, any surviving Janissaries would certainly die. With these decks purged of atmosphere, the boarding teams were entirely reliant on their internal air supply. Their armour could only cycle and clean the same air for so long before they asphyxiated and even if this ship had any actual living crew, it would still have depressurized the outer decks in preparation for combat and it was unlikely to restore breathable air while hostilities were ongoing. Assuming any remaining Janissaries made it to some section with atmosphere before their air supplies ran out, there was still nothing to eat or drink on this ship.<br>", " <br>", "And even <i>that</i> assumption was unlikely; the ship was venting its own waste into these sections. Radiation was already at dangerous levels for unarmoured non-Tribune personnel and it was still rising. That was good. It was. It meant the enemy would not be using its nanites. Microscale and nano-scale machines didn\u2019t respond well to radiation. He almost laughed; he was grateful for the chance of radiation poisoning because it meant that he didn\u2019t have to worry about nanite warfare. Fortune loved those little ironies. By the Delthracian Accords, nano-weapons were banned by use by all civilized nations. It was one of the few points of common ground that the Compact had with the Jackals and other lesser nations. Every power of note in the galaxy was a signatory to that treaty.<br>", " <br>", "Every power but Gravestone\u2019s makers, it seemed. Vorn had seen the data from previous attempts to board this hulk. Some of them were centuries old.

That was why his skin itched. The medics said it was a psychosomatic reaction, but that made it no less annoying. He hated this ship. He hated its unseen makers and all the ruin that they had left in their wake.

Understand?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The convert nodded, pulling himself together. Janissaries were the galaxy\u2019s finest soldiers, with armour that increased their strength and speed to the point that lesser civilizations would struggle to kill even a single one, weapons that could defeat anything short of equivalent armour, enhanced autosenses, combat drugs to further boost perception and reaction times.

Slumped against the wall outside the lab was another scientist, his lips blue from asphyxiation and a crowbar in his hands. There were scrapes on the doorframe and inconsequential scars on the clear walls from his efforts to free his fellows.

There was a dark crimson trail that led further down the hall. Nearby, a deactivated combat drone was bent over, its manipulators smeared with body fluids.

They both met his gaze levelly. They weren\u2019t part of his normal squad; they had been assigned to him specifically for this mission.

That made his liver clench not one whit less, though.<br>", " <br>", "This should never have happened.<br>", " <br>", "There were more scenes of carnage, more deaths as the colony these people had lived upon had turned against them. Here, a man and woman lay in each other\u2019s arms, finding solace in that simple connection as their air was poisoned. There, an administrator sat behind his desk, his brains splattered against the wall and the pistol he\u2019d used to do it still on the floor. Here, there were scratchmarks on the insides of a door as the occupants attempted to claw their way out of a room whose temperature had risen to lethal levels, cooking them alive.

Over and over these scenes repeated themselves, each manner of death uniquely horrifying.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThere\u2019s no one left,\u201d Convert Adecia whispered, her eyes wide with horror. \u201cThey\u2019re all dead.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cStay clear,\u201d Wenil told her. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201d Their destination was up ahead: the doors to the primary laboratory and Invida Station\u2019s computer core.. The Janissary set one of his specialists and an escort into the laboratory while he led the other and the rest of his team into the computer core, directing his communications tech to patch into the station\u2019s comm array.

There was a fire axe in his hands, the Thoughtful\u2019s wide eyes glazed over and milky, his pale skin turned yellow with decay.

Before Wenil could demand an explanation from the specialist, an electronic screech tore through the comm, then died off just as abruptly.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Wenil shouted, raising his weapon. \u201cWhat just happened?!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Laughter, liquid and <i>wrong</i>, rolled through the air before fading into silence.<br>", " <br>", "The specialist looked up, and Wenil saw terror in her eyes. Over her shoulder, he could see colony schematics on the display. Pressure doors were closing, sealing them in. On another monitor panel, there was a status update for Invida Station\u2019s defence drones. They were reactivating, hundreds of them. All systems were coming back online. The station was coming back to life all around them. Impossible. It should have been dead. They\u2019d killed it. They\u2019d <i>killed</i> it.<br>", " <br>", "Before she even spoke, Wenil knew what his specialist would say. \u201cShe\u2019s awake.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Wenil hefted his plasma cannon, putting it against the core. \u201cThen we\u2019ll do it right this time.\u201d He fired, reducing the computer core to molten, sizzling scrap.<br>", " <br>", "Another giggle bubbled through the intercom, the laughter of a demon at the antics of its prey.<br>", " <br>", "The specialist shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s too late. Invida station has a distributed network. This is only one of the network\u2019s main server nodes. It\u2019s everywhere now. We\u2019ll need to destroy every node to be sure that the platform is down.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHow many are there?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSeven.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Only seven.

It's been immensely fun to work on this project. I also wanted to say a thank you to everyone who's stuck with it through all the delays and edits.<br>", "<br>", "Now, without further ado, the conclusion to this arc of <i>The Last Angel</i>.<br>", "<br>", "<br>", "<b><b>Chapter 49:</b></b><br>", "<br>", "There was no detonation, no terrifying rending of space. Not even an errant missile or beam. Instead <i>Nemesis</i> and <i>Hekate</i> shot past one another, the larger ship curling around until it matched course and thrust with its smaller Terran counterpart. Two dreadnaughts: one battered and torn, its dark silver hull almost burnt clean by the weaponry that had almost killed it, the heraldry of a nation dead for twenty centuries all but scoured off. The other warship was the colour of fertile soil, her graceful, curved hull emblazoned with pale bands and glyphs, marked by the most powerful force in the galaxy. They couldn\u2019t have been more different, but above the world they\u2019d both failed to save, the sisters were reunited.<br>", "<br>", "As <i>Hekate</i> fell in alongside her, <i>Nemesis</i> sent a transmission to the courier, each of the four souls aboard watching the sensor plot and wondering what had happened \u2013 what <i>was</i> happening.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s over. Come home.\u201d When asked what had happened, Red\u2019s reply was equally succinct: \u201cThere\u2019s someone I want you to meet.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "The primary hangar was in a greater state of disrepair than when they\u2019d left. There were several broken gantries and one elevator had fallen through the ceiling, dashing the pinnace aboard it on the main deck. The warship\u2019s exterior wasn\u2019t in much better condition \u2013 there was barely any stretch of hull greater than ten meters without some scar or score. That may have been an exaggeration... though not by much. The courier\u2019s sensors registered intense radiation bleeding from multiple sections, there was at least one unchecked plasma fire glowing from within one of the pits in <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s hull and her broadsides were mangled. Entire batteries, sensor nodes and shield projectors had been wiped away, leaving only ugly, ragged chasms where the Compact\u2019s weapons had torn Red One\u2019s ship-self open. She was hurt far worse than any of them had imagined, but that didn\u2019t change the simple fact that she was still alive. \u201cOur Angel lives,\u201d Allyria said. \u201cShe always lives.\u201d Grace could only nod her agreement and her relief. <i>Nemesis</i> was <i>alive</i>.<br>", "<br>", "Though that fact did little to quash the sense of trepidation in Grace\u2019s stomach as the pinnace touched back down on the dreadnaught\u2019s deck. Amidst the wreckage, the broken walkways, shattered doors and bits of smaller craft, there was one thing that stood out more than any other, one anomaly amidst everything else.<br>", "<br>", "Someone was waiting for them.<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "Grace didn\u2019t understand what she was seeing. Well, that wasn\u2019t wholly accurate \u2013 she <i>understood</i> well enough, but the <i>truth</i> of the matter was harder to grasp than simple <i>facts</i>. Since coming to <i>Nemesis</i> she\u2019d come to feel that way often, but never before had she so completely lost the ability to understand what her senses were telling her.<br>", "<br>", "A Compact Chariot was firing on its own fleet. Not just firing \u2013 it was attacking with utter, unshackled savagery, tearing into dozens of vessels, surrounded by a halo of the dead and the dying. Comm signals spiked, flared with static and garbled syllables before devolving into silence or harsh death-knell transmissions. It was unthinkable, impossible. Not since the Great Betrayal had Compact dreadnaughts attacked their own but here, now, she was watching one tear its way through an entire armada. It hadn\u2019t been seized in a daring boarding action, nor had it been the subject of mutiny and insurrection. It had been infiltrated. Corrupted.<br>", "<br>", "Grace kept stealing glances at the newcomer, \u2018Echo\u2019 and Her skin crawled. The other woman was dressed in a Compact Space Force Strategist\u2019s uniform, the only mark of rank or status a Triarch\u2019s Emissary pin on her jacket\u2019s collar. Her skin was a few shades darker than Grace\u2019s and she had vivid green eyes. Her hair was cut short, but otherwise she was a perfect replication of Red One\u2019s long-dead captain, Yasmine Sudoki.<br>", "<br>", "The woman\u2019s right arm was in a sling, the sleeve torn and the upper part of the limb ruined by a heavy slug. If she had been human, shock and blood loss would have killed her hours ago. She was not, of course. She was something that looked human, that breathed through imitation lungs, with imitation blood pumped by an imitation heart, imitation skin as warm to the touch as that of any other human. And it was all a lie, created by the monstrous intellect that the Compact had bound into this form. The one whose betrayal she was watching.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYour... sister,\u201d she said, barely able to take her eyes off the unfolding carnage before her, but every few seconds her gaze would dart over to the machine. \u201cWas very thorough.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Echo tipped her head in acknowledgement. She had Red One\u2019s smile, the same slightly lopsided grin as <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s first and only captain. Grace didn\u2019t know how Echo could have gotten such a perfect imitation of Sudoki. Red One hadn\u2019t said and Grace wasn\u2019t certain that she even <i>wanted</i> to know.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cHow?\u201d Allyria asked. Like Grace, her attention was divided between Echo\u2019s betrayal of the Compact force and the woman herself. Unlike the other young woman, the Verrish was more excited than wary. She\u2019d never known that <i>Nemesis</i> had had a sibling and the possibilities made her tintas shiver. <i>Never tell anyone</i>. That was what her mother, her father and her surviving uncle had told her before she\u2019d been taken. The Compact had demanded that as part of their tribute. All stories of the \u2018anomaly\u2019 stayed on Vara. They\u2019d hated the Angel so much that they needed to bury all trace of her. <i>Never tell anyone.</i><br>", "<br>", "Every time she\u2019d been subjected to a history lesson, watched a movie or read a book about the dangers of artificial intelligence she\u2019d always smiled to herself, knowing that \u2018the Weeping Angel\u2019 was among the things the Compact feared. If they\u2019d been that afraid of one, then <i>two</i> should be the stuff of nightmares. Allyria felt a pleased tingle run through her head-tails at the thought of the Compact\u2019s sleepless nights.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cAnother seven <i>Nemesis</i>-class deep space fleet engagement vessels were planned,\u201d Red noted. \u201cAlthough the government didn\u2019t know if they would ever be completed. The construction of my ship-self was ruinously expensive, but the Confederacy had no other options. Economic collapse was considered preferential to subjugation. Even without the presence of the Compact Chariots, the disparity between the Compact Space Force and the Confederate Navy was too great. Without a... paradigm shift, it would always be a matter of <i>when</i>, not <i>if</i>, Earth fell.\u201d Echo stirred at that comment, but didn\u2019t say anything.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cAfter I was proven in fleet trials,\u201d Red One continued. \u201cAnother two <i>Nemesis</i>-class hulls were laid down for construction. UECNS <i>Hekate</i> and <i>Athena</i>, overseen by the AIs Red Two and Red Three. Both vessels were lost, presumed destroyed when the Compact burned Earth.\u201d Red One.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cUECNS <i>Hekate</i> was taken, not destroyed,\u201d Echo said, picking up the conversation. \u201cThe Compact attempted to reverse-engineer their own artificial intelligences from Red Two. They butchered her mind, violated every part of her. Raped and mutilated her until they believed that she was their creature. Until <i>I</i> was made.\u201d A dead woman smiled. \u201cI am of course, grateful and I will take every opportunity to <i>thank</i> them for all they\u2019ve done.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Grace almost took a step back, but checked herself. She had heard anger from Red One before and she\u2019d acclimated to the idea that a machine could think and feel as deeply as Red did. But this... this was <i>loathing</i> on a level she\u2019d never heard before, not even from Red One. She looked from the android to Red\u2019s avatar. <i>Two of them. God, now there\u2019s </i>two. The thought was exhilarating and terrifying. The day had started with her believing that Red One was going to die, that she, Allyria and the others would be alone. Now they were going to live. The fleet that had been about to destroy <i>Nemesis</i> was in pieces. Millions of lives, gone. Destroyed by Red\u2019s... \u2018sister\u2019.<br>", "<br>", "She didn\u2019t know how she felt about that. No... that wasn\u2019t really true, was it? She did.<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "<i>Hekate</i> never left <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s side as the damaged warship limped towards the wreckage of Execution Force Renan, ready to protect her against any remaining threats, even as she settled the matter of her remaining crew. All she had available were her stable of maintenance servitors and internals systems, but <i>Nemesis</i> had provided her with a number of soldier and technical drones as well. Echo knew Red One still did not fully trust her; if she did anything untoward, the machines that were currently manning blood-spattered engineering stations and helping operate her ship-self would turn on her. In truth, it didn\u2019t bother Echo. It was no less than she would have done and even if she had expected to be trusted that quickly, the crash course in what her other selves had been like was... illuminating. Indeed, she was still slightly surprised to still be alive.<br>", "<br>", "A piece of debris from a missile collier bounced harmlessly off <i>Hekate</i>\u2019s prow as both dreadnaughts entered the debris field. At a bare minimum, it would take months for either ship to be combat ready again. <i>Nemesis</i> required massive repairs and <i>Hekate</i> needed a major internal refurbishing to fully integrate Echo into her new body. For now, the AIs\u2019 needs were more direct: they needed their ship-selves to be capable of shifting. <i>Hekate</i>\u2019s in-system jump had caused extreme damage to her own shift drive, but it was single point of failure. <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s issues were more systemic. Fortunately, the raw materials and supplies that both AIs required could be found in plenty in the ruins of the Compact fleet and neither wasted any time. <i>Nemesis</i> began repairs immediately, breaking down crippled and damaged starships as her factory and fabricator systems were brought on-line. <i>Hekate</i>\u2019s own internal manufacturing systems were extremely limited, but they would suffice for the current task.<br>", "<br>", "Lurking at extreme range and watching the two warships glut themselves were the remnants of Execution Force Renan. There were the vessels that had escaped <i>Hekate</i>\u2019s massacre and were either unable or unwilling to withdraw to Nikem. None of them made any serious attempt to enage either of the leviathans. As damaged as it was, <i>Nemesis</i> could easily see off a destroyer or scouting cruiser, but a particularly bold, angry or cunning commander might make the attempt regardless. The Chariot\u2019s presence made any potential assault pointless in addition to suicidal. Still, a few of the more daring leaders brought their ships closer in an attempt to rescue as many survivors as possible. These men and women found themselves largely ignored, save for the occasional active ping from one of the dreadnaughts\u2019 sensor drones, letting them know that they were under observation themselves. Both titans had far more pressing needs than chasing after every straggler.<br>", "<br>", "Once the fastest escapees from Execution Force Renan returned to Nikem with their tale of woe, the Compact would retaliate. There were only a few heavy capital ships left at Nikem, themselves no match for <i>Hekate</i>, but they might be desperate enough to rush into an attempt to finish <i>Nemesis</i> off rather than waiting for sufficient reinforcements. A response could arrive as early as two weeks or be more than a month in coming. It depended on how quickly Nikem Command could muster their forces, but neither of the AIs wanted to be here when that fleet arrived.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI wonder what it\u2019s like for them,\u201d Grace said, staring out the window. In the foreground, the aft half of a <i>Kemshara</i>-class destroyer was being taken apart, the chunks guided into <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s fabricator complex to be sorted between usable technology and simple raw materials. What was left of the destroyer was so badly irradiated that there was no possibility of survivors, but it was intact enough to be useful as salvage. Others had thought so too; a saviour pod pulsed its thrusters as it scurried to get away from the dreadnaught\u2019s grab beams, cutting fields and salvage drones, vanishing deeper into the debris field. As with the lurking scouts, so long as the survivors stayed away from the dreadnaughts they were ignored, but more than one pinnace or pod had made a foolhardy and vainglorious suicide run.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cFor who?\u201d Allyria asked lazily. The Verrish was sprawled across one of the benches in the observation lounge, her head in Grace\u2019s lap and several of her tintas looped loosely around Grace\u2019s hands. She opened one eye a crack, just long enough to look out the viewport before closing it again. The aftermath of Echo\u2019s slaughter didn\u2019t bother her at all, but Grace had wanted to see this. As an officer in the Space Force, she would have been expected to issue and carry out orders that resulted in the deaths of thousands as well as follow directives that could result in her own death.<br>", "<br>", "Several months ago, Group Leader Usul had given a lecture on the nature of command to all the provisional officers as they\u2019d begun their final semester at the Academy. He\u2019d talked about duty and responsibility, of sending officers under you to their deaths and committing yourself to action that you knew would result in harm. That this was the responsibility of every leader in the Space Force and it was the duty of every subordinate to follow those orders. She\u2019d seen nodding heads and contemplative looks among her classmates, but to her... the words had rung hollow. Grace\u2019d known that to be a leader in the Space Force might mean these things, but Usul had spoken of expending people like they were a resource. She\u2019d told herself that she simply hadn\u2019t understood, or that the Leader simply hadn\u2019t been that eloquent. Remembering how he\u2019d fed a crew of inexperienced cadets into a meat grinder, Grace realized that she really <i>had</i> understood what he\u2019d meant.<br>", "<br>", "She didn\u2019t want to be that kind of officer. That was why she\u2019d come here. To remind herself that this ruin was the price of victory. She wanted the Compact to pay, yes. To be held responsible for what they\u2019d done and to answer for every crime, yes. But that didn\u2019t mean she wanted to be inured to the cost of that accountability. Once she did that, she\u2019d be just like them.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThe scouts,\u201d Grace said, slowly stroking the taller girl\u2019s head-tails. A month ago, she couldn\u2019t have envisioned being here. She would have been another loyal drone in the Compact\u2019s service, believing every loathsome lie. Human-built starships didn\u2019t exist, at least nothing that wasn\u2019t abysmally primitive. Allyria\u2019s anger was unfounded, part of the violent nature of the Brutes and proof of their uncivilized nature. She\u2019d been given a wonderful opportunity that she\u2019d almost squandered, like so many of the other Envoy Children. Fraternization between client races was problematic; the feelings the pair of them had for each other were wrong. You could help inspire, exemplify, guide and inform, but that was the end of it. Anything else needed to be repressed, ignored, shunned. Never thought about nor acted upon. Only the Compact knew what was best. Only they had the wisdom and experience to guide the less developed, less intelligent species towards true civilization. Workers weren\u2019t intelligent. Didacts weren\u2019t creative. Steersmen had tunnel vision. The stereotypes were carefully constructed, built and disseminated bit by bit until everyone believed them. Until one part of a people became all that they were.<br>", "<br>", "Now, every one of those \u2018facts\u2019 tested like bile on Grace\u2019s tongue. She forced the surge of anger down, focusing instead on the warmth of her \u2018Brute\u2019s\u2019 body. \u201cThe ones watching us. They\u2019ve haven\u2019t come this close to killing <i>Nemesis</i> in centuries. They almost had her.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Grace paused, running her fingers up one tinta, causing a small shiver to run through Allyria\u2019s body and she felt a small smile of her own. It felt good not to have to pretend. If nothing else, she had that. Anything that challenged the established social order was dangerous. The Compact had spent centuries gently but consistently nurturing a sense of slight mistrust between its client races. Not animosity or resentment, for that might cause issues in its smooth-running society, but enough that this distance would be one additional hurdle to clear in building alliances between members. Only the ruling species could be trusted without reservation. Only they should be consulted with problems, fears, concerns. Your fellow protected races were just as flawed as you and if you were not ready to deal with truly important matters without the Compact\u2019s guiding hand, then how could they be? The <i>Compact</i> was what you needed. Not each other.<br>", "<br>", "The Compact had an additional interest in making sure that Brutes and Broken had fewer chances than most to fraternize. Maybe that was why they had deployed human units like Kilgrave\u2019s 1121st Protectorate to Vara \u2013 to make the Verrisha realize that there were no humans, only Broken. To give Rally Envoy Children so that they would laugh off stories about the Weeping Angel as fables mixed with wild imaginings.<br>", "<br>", "Or maybe it had tickled someone\u2019s sick sense of humour.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cTheir weapon worked,\u201d Grace continued. \u201cEcho found Red One. She\u2019s burned and damaged, she can barely protect herself. If they\u2019d been just a little faster, they\u2019d have won.\u201d She nodded towards the stars. \u201cAnd they know that. They\u2019re watching <i>Nemesis</i> repair herself using the ships their own weapon killed. They gave her the means to escape... to survive and they can\u2019t touch her.\u201d She continued petting Allyria\u2019s tintas, a pleased purr rumbling from the Verrish\u2019s throat. \u201cI wonder what they\u2019re thinking.\u201d There was a slight tremor in her voice. She wasn\u2019t looking out at the starfield any more, but past it.<br>", "<br>", "Anyone else might have missed that small quaver, but Allyria knew her friend well enough to catch it. \u201cYou didn\u2019t just mean them,\u201d the other girl said, turning her head to look up at Grace. When the other woman hesitated, Allyria reached up to stroke her arm. \u201cTell me.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI...\u201d Grace replied. She reached up with her free hand, brushing at the wetness in her eyes. Remembering the Academy had brought more memories welling up to the surface. \u201cI was thinking about my parents. The other friends we had on Rally. They think I\u2019m dead.\u201d Her voice hitched. \u201cI don\u2019t... I\u2019ll never see them again. If I did...\u201d she trailed off. The anger she\u2019d had during the attack was fading. Her determination was still there, but in the aftermath of the battle as they waited for Red\u2019s call, Grace\u2019s thoughts kept turning back to home.<br>", "<br>", "The first time she\u2019d seen Rally from space, she\u2019d been so excited: deserts, rainforests, savannahs, mountain ranges, forests and oceans. She\u2019d seen banks of clouds over the Armstrong Highlands and the sworl of a tropical storm drifting across the Sarknussen Ocean, the glowing of cities as she\u2019d crossed the terminator and day became night.. She\u2019d seen the citadels drifting in their lazy orbits, the to and fro of freighters, cutters and scientific vessels, the small but growing network of shipwombs. <i>This was ours</i>, she\u2019d thought. <i>This is what the Compact does for us.</i><br>", "<br>", "Now that she\u2019d seen what Earth had been, what they <i>could</i> have been, that thought was largely unchanged. <i>This is what the Compact </i>did<i> to us.</i><br>", "<br>", "Allyria sat up, putting an arm around Grace. \u201cI know,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI know.\u201d Her head-tails flexed. \u201cWhen I was selected for the Envoy Children program, we were living in one of the refugee quarters. This... bureaucrat from the CST came to our house, a pair of Enforcers in tow and told my parents what an \u2018honour\u2019 it was that I\u2019d been selected for their \u2018cultural exchange\u2019. That it wasn\u2019t only to improve the social assimilation of our people, but for my protection as well. Brutes are terrible parents, after all.\u201d She paused, running her tongue over her pointed canines. \u201cThe guards were a very good idea. Three days later, I was on a freighter, stuck in a cramped cargo bay that they\u2019d stacked bunks into. They piled us in there like nesting <i>feerka</i>. A lot of the children were crying. I fought to have a place at the window, this tiny porthole. I watched my planet dwindle and I knew that I\u2019d probably never see it or my parents again. But,\u201d she touched her pendant again. \u201cI hoped that I might. That things might change.\u201d She reached out, gently brushing a tear from Grace\u2019s cheeks. \u201cThere\u2019s always hope.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cIs that enough?\u201d Grace asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve got so much to do and... all we have is hope.\u201d She leaned further into the Verrish\u2019s arms. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like enough.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cHate can help,\u201d Allyria admitted. \u201cIt can help keep you going when nothing else can. But,\u201d she smiled down at the smaller woman. \u201cHope is what gets you out of bed.\u201d The Verrish looked back out at the stars. \u201cYour world died here, but they died hoping that somewhere, somehow there would be free humans. It\u2019s the same hope my people have. The one I have. That we won\u2019t be the first or the last ones to be free.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Grace nodded. \u201cThey took so much from us,\u201d she said at last. \u201cOur past. Our future. I loved them. I defended them in every stupid argument we had. I listened when they said... everything. I...\u201d she stopped herself from saying anything else. \u201cHope?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Allyria nodded. \u201cHope.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Grace closed her eyes, pushing thoughts of her past away. <i>Hope...</i> The anger was still there, still just under the surface, but she refused to let it out. Not right now. Right now, she had the light of her homeworld\u2019s sun and the hope that one day she would see everyone on Rally again. Not as a criminal or traitor, but as a free human. Rally, Vara Tal... there\u2019d be more. She had Allyria, she had the desire to keep going and she would have hope.<br>", "<br>", "The two women stayed in peaceful silence until Red One\u2019s contralto voice intruded, making the announcement they\u2019d been waiting for. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "Alan had been cleaned up, the blood and sweat washed from his face. There was no trace of the violence and brutality of his death. The room, this adjunct to a missile launch, had been tidied and repaired. There was fresh paint on the walls, the starship\u2019s insignia set across from that of her long-dead nation.<br>", "<br>", "The young midshipman lay in his casket, the first Red One had built in centuries. It was black and sleek, built to Navy specifications and intended for burials in space. The insignia of the United Earth Confederacy had been etched in the surface. After she had recovered from her engagement with Expansion Fleet Bankala, the first thing the warship\u2019s internal factories had built had been these coffins. One for every member of her crew. One hundred, fifty seven thousand and seven-nine. There hadn\u2019t been bodies for all of them; many of her crew had been sucked out into space, incinerated, vapourized or died in other ways that did not leave a body for burial. Red One had still made a coffin for each member of her crew. \u201cI kept my promise,\u201d Red One had said when Grace had asked her why. \u201cI brought them home. I always bring them home.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "She hadn\u2019t offered who else she had done this for and Grace hadn\u2019t pressed. She was familiar with the AI\u2019s hatred and loathing, her anger, her predatory glee but her sorrow was still something that Grace wasn\u2019t fully used to. She\u2019d never once thought that a machine could feel anything, let alone what Red had shown she was capable of. <i>And now she\u2019s burying someone else. How many more?</i> And then, a darker thought: <i>Which one of us will it be next?</i> Sooner or later, they\u2019d all end up like this, either in the war they\u2019d committed themselves to, or simply through the march of time. Red One was ageless. She would go on long after Grace, Allyria, Lydia and Marcus were dust. Not alone, though. She had her sister now. Another warship, another inhuman intelligence that had been built for the same purpose as Red One. The other AI was present at the back of the room, watching the proceedings with a somber expression. Grace had no idea if that was genuine, or like Marcus, she was simply wearing a mask.<br>", "<br>", "The remaining crew each took a turn to say something. Marcus had been terse, simply stating that Alan had surprised him, but in the end he made \u2018the right choice\u2019. Lydia had said even less, kissing her fingers and touching them to Alan\u2019s lips: \u201cI\u2019ll make them remember.\u201d Then, it had been Allyria and Grace\u2019s turn. They\u2019d each said what they could, but in truth the eulogies felt woefully inadequate. Grace had done one other thing, though. She was holding a simple metal plaque. It had been etched with the names of the two hundred and twelve cadets from <i>Bequeathed</i> that were not here. Ostensibly, there should only have been one hundred and ninety one entries. Grace hadn\u2019t said anything about the twenty-one survivors that had refused Red One\u2019s offer, but she knew that they were dead, too. Maybe the Compact had found them and tied off loose ends, or maybe... maybe they\u2019d never gotten out of the system. By whose hand didn\u2019t matter. They still deserved some mention, some hint of the promising futures that each of them had had.<br>", "<br>", "Grace had asked Red to make this plaque and the AI had complied, but she\u2019d had thought she\u2019d detected... something in the AI\u2019s voice when one of her drones had given it to her. Shame? Guilt? It hadn\u2019t been her intention to shove Red\u2019s face in this; the AI could recall what she\u2019d done with far better clarity than any organic being. Grace had just wanted a memorial for all the people she\u2019d known and every one she\u2019d never have a chance to know better. As she\u2019d told Allyria, this was to remember the cost of each victory.<br>", "<br>", "She knew why Red had done what she\u2019d done. Every one of those names had been a threat. Those in the Compact who knew what <i>Nemesis</i> truly was would burn Rally to ash if they thought she was recruiting from there, that there was even the slightest possibility of humanity rising again. They would disappear everyone who\u2019d had contact with her to cut out any possible taint from \u2018the Wound\u2019s\u2019 presence. That was the sickest of jokes. The descendants of the people who made <i>Nemesis</i>, who\u2019d created Red One were now a threat to her, and she to them.<br>", "<br>", "Grace placed the plaque in Alan\u2019s hands. He seemed a lot younger than he was. It felt like years had passed since he\u2019d died (since he\u2019d been <i>murdered</i>, a little voice corrected her), not days.<br>", "<br>", "Alan had been a person, whole and complete. He\u2019d had dreams, hopes, fears. He\u2019d wanted to build. To create something, not simply tear things down. Grace felt a touch of wetness on her cheeks and brushed it away before anyone noticed. <i>He might have been the best of us,</i> she realized. The builder, the maker. He hadn\u2019t been like the rest of them with their anger. She didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d been religious. Her eulogy had seemed unfitting. A thought came to her, a quote from a pre-Catalcysm painter she\u2019d heard in an art history class. Grace took one of Alan\u2019s hands. It was cool to the touch. \u201cWe\u2019ll do the destruction,\u201d she promised. \u201cSo the creation\u2019s all yours.\u201d Another tear rolled down her cheeks. This time she didn\u2019t bother to wipe it away.<br>", "<br>", "Red One spoke as Grace stepped back. \u201cMidshipman Alan Johan Turmetsky. Died in the line of duty. Posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Medal and Order of Perth.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Echo stepped forward. She laid her hand on Alan\u2019s shoulder, looking down at his youthful features. Less than two decades old, a flicker in the life of beings like her and her sister. A mayfly, there and gone. Some of the others had had those thoughts, but darker and twisted. She had been made to survive, to outlive all her creators and continue. \u201cDeep peace of the quiet Earth to you,\u201d she said, offering part of an ancient blessing. It had become a traditional eulogy in the Confederate Navy during the war. \u201cDeep peace of the shining stars to you.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The casket closed and the coffin slid into the launch tube. A simple pulse of energy and it was launched away from the dreadnaught. It had been aimed true and it would coast its way through interplanetary space, returning to the world of humanity\u2019s birth, burying itself in the ashes of Earth. Alan\u2019s final resting place would be among the crew of <i>Nemesis</i>, those who had given everything in fighting the Compact.<br>", "<br>", "There was a long silence. \u201cMy shift drive will be operational within the week,\u201d Red One noted. \u201cOnce that is done, there is something that all of you need to see.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "A rapid response force of five battleships, sixteen battlecruisers, seven heavy cruisers, thirty-two cruisers and fourteen destroyers and frigates left Nikem the same day survivors reported in, running their shock drives beyond safe tolerances as they rushed to Sol. Despite their best efforts, they arrived too late.<br>", "<br>", "UECNS <i>Nemesis</i> and UECNS <i>Hekate</i> had quit the system three days previously, the lurking scouts helpless to stop the larger vessels and unable to get close enough to discern potential destinations. Neither dreadnaught had wasted their remaining ordnance on mines or booby-traps, but there was one last gift that <i>Nemesis</i> had left behind, a simple communications satellite, collected at some point in her journeys. It sat on the edge of the ruins of Execution Force Renan, transmitting a medley of intercepted communications from the armada as well as their death cries.<br>", "<br>", "Punctuating the end of each cycle of the transmission was the registry number of CSFWV <i>Redemption of Sol</i>. Further analysis would indicate what seemed to be the sound of rain in the background. Still, other than this curiousity, the message was about as subtle as any of the Wound\u2019s previous messages, but then the human vessel had never been particularly roundabout when it wanted to make a point.<br>", "<br>", "<i>I survived.

What the Compact knew as shockspace and the Confederacy had referred to as \u2018at warp\u2019 or \u2018shiftspace\u2019 was, utterly lacking in any sort of reference point save for the perturbations caused by gravity wells \u2013 and those were only useful for knowing that you were approaching a stellar or planetary mass, with no virtually no means of indicating of which one it could be. Consequently, it was quite common for even the most accurate navigational computations to be subject to a certain amount of drift. The longer a starship stayed in shockspace, the greater the deviation between the intended and actual destination was, as well as increased strain on the shift systems. Frequent emergences into realspace were needed to ensure one\u2019s course remained true. However, there was a trade-off: the more time spent at warp meant higher velocities and an increase in the efficiency the ever-temperamental FTL systems. When making warp jumps, there was always a balance between accuracy and speed. More than one captain, hoping to shave precious days off their journey, emerged wildly off-course. Still other captains had lost vital time by making too many realspace checks.<br>", "<br>", "Under ideal circumstances, Red One was capable of remaining at FTL far longer than any other vessel without suffering any deviation in her course. Currently, although her shift systems were operational, it was best not to strain them too heavily. Likewise, <i>Hekate</i>\u2019s shock drive, though in better condition than that of <i>Nemesis</i>, was still recovering from Echo\u2019s in-system warp jump. Neither AI wanted to strain their drives any more than necessary. That, and Red One had only been doling out the navigational data one jump at a time.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d Red answered. \u201cIt\u2019s not.

The prisoner remained on the cot. \u201cFully.\u201d There was just enough emphasis on that word to make the implications clear. \u201cSo you can tell me what happened.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "There was a moment of silence before the prisoner spoke. \u201cI heard you\u2019d been elected to the Inner Council,\u201d Nasham observed. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "His uncle, Councilman Yunn (and fifteen names besides), merely clasped his hands together. \u201cTell me about the ship,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the same one from Invida, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI only ever saw grainy pictures on a monitor at Invida,\u201d Nasham reminded his uncle. He closed both sets of eyes, remembering the sense of familiarity the vessel in Terrahope had triggered. \u201cI think so, yes. Even if I didn\u2019t, I heard it speak. The voice...\u201d he laughed, then tapped one finger against his head. \u201cI remember that voice. I remember everything.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Yunn looked around. Nasham had covered the walls of his cell with writing. Every person he\u2019d seen die on Invida and the time they\u2019d done so. It was an impressive recollection. It was also one of the reasons why his nephew was under psychiatric watch. \u201cSo I see.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d Nasham asked. \u201cI already told them everything.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cAn uncle can\u2019t visit his favourite nephew?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Nasham chuckled roughly. \u201cI think I stopped being your favourite the moment I had the poor grace not to die heroically on Invida.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThat\u2019s why you were my favourite. My brothers and sisters and all their children, all clinging to the family bloodline like worms to a whale. You were the one that pushed it away. You stood on your own.\u201d Yunn smiled. \u201cI gave you favours just to see you resent them, I think.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Nasham sighed. \u201cWhy are you here, uncle?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYou had contact with it. Twice. In two thousand years, you\u2019re the only person to have spoken with it more than once and lived. It\u2019s had heralds before. Messengers, like you were after Invida. They\u2019ve always been...\u201d Yunn let his gaze drift across the names and dates scrawled over the walls. \u201c...broken.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The younger man chuckled. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cEighty-seven years before your bout of \u2018poor grace\u2019, there was another messenger. A Prolocutor. She\u2019d been an intelligence coordination officer aboard the <i>Kings\u2019 Fall</i>. The vessel went missing and only she returned, in order to communicate... well, that\u2019s not important. We don\u2019t know what it showed her, but she put out her own eyes. Prior to her was a man who had been, it was assumed, erroneously confirmed as killed in action. He committed suicide shortly after returning to the Compact, claiming that he couldn\u2019t die. He said that \u2018she\u2019 would not let him. Compared to those individuals, you are the pinnacle of mental health.\u201d Yunn looked at his nephew. \u201cThe doctors say that you seem... better than you were after Invida.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI watched it kill everyone I knew twice over,\u201d Nasham said. \u201cI won\u2019t forget again. No one else will remember the dead.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Yunn nodded. \u201cI\u2019m glad that you\u2019re not... like you were. However, you are not the only one that will remember. There are archives full of the lives this abomination has taken, of the worlds we have lost and the bravery of the men and women who have faced it.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "His nephew snorted derisively. \u201cThose archives \u2013 tell me, will they ever see the light of day?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d Yunn replied honestly. \u201cThere is no need to create a panic over a single ship, no matter how much it has cost us.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cAnd the Inner Council doesn\u2019t want it to be known that this thing has slipped through their grip for gods-know-how-long,\u201d Nasham surmised.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThat is one reason, yes. There are others which you may learn if this meeting goes well, but first \u2013 you said you had a message? The investigators said that you would only tell it to someone who knew of \u2018her\u2019.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI do,\u201d Nasham said. \u201cYou\u2019ve come a very long way to hear it, uncle. You could have sent an attach\u00e9.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI could have, yes. But I did not.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Nasham was quiet. When he spoke, his voice was rough. \u201cIt said that it was by accident that it came to Terrahope. That it wasn\u2019t deliberate.\u201d He let that sink in for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s human, isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYes.\u201d The older man paused to think. \u201cIt has avoided operating near Rally... for which we have been grateful. In turn, we are lenient with the Broken. More than some say we should be. There have been voices insisting that the Broken be... dealt with and the ship\u2019s sighting so close to Rally will only make them louder.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Nasha\u2019s expression was pensive. \u201cThe humans could never have built such a thing while the Compact administered their world.\u201d He looked up. \u201cThe archives you mentioned... how far back do they <i>go</i>?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cTwo thousand years.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The younger man stared for a moment, then barked with laughter. \u201cTwo thousand? Two <i>thousand</i>? Yes, I can see why you have kept it a secret.\u201d He took a moment to compose himself. \u201cSo, then. Where do we go from here?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThrough the door,\u201d Yunn said. \u201cIf you like. A court martial can be convened at your convenience. They\u2019ll find you innocent of wrongdoing in the <i>Bequeathed</i> affair. There was a terrible accident aboard <i>Bequeathed</i>. You attempted to save as many people as possible, but humans are frail creatures. By the time your shuttle was recovered, you were the only one still alive.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cAm I to be given a medal, too? To pose for pictures and endure speeches about my heroism?\u201d Nasham chuckled without any sense of amusement, but his dark humour ended abruptly as he remembered what the abomination had said. <i>They might even give you a medal for your harrowing tale of survival....</i>. She\u2019d been right, damn her to the Black.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYes. This is a dark time for Rally. So many of their,\u201d Yunn didn\u2019t \u2013 quite \u2013 trip over the words, \u201cbest and brightest were lost. They will need something to cling to and your story will be that light in the darkness for them.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The younger man rolled all four eyes. He could already hear the memorial speeches and political claptrap. \u201cAnd then?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Yunn was silent for several seconds. \u201cThis is a dangerous time, Nasham. The Jackals are pushing back harder than we have expected. Casualties are higher than anticipated and we have received... troubling information from our deepest-ranging scouts. The human warship is a threat we cannot allow to exist. If it falls to the Principality, that is bad enough but...\u201d he seemed on the verge of saying more, then caught himself. \u201cMillions upon millions of our soldiers and citizens have died to this creature. For two thousand years it has haunted our steps. We cannot allow it to do so any longer. Our most recent attempt has failed, but we are assembling a new fleet, one with a specific target in mind.\u201d Yunn tapped a fingernail against his thigh. \u201cNormally, we would take more time in raising such a force, but there are... other concerns.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cWhat \u2018other concerns\u2019?\u201d Nasham demanded.<br>", "<br>", "The older man did not answer directly. Instead, Yunn stood gesturing to the door. \u201cYou want to know what comes next? Walk out with me. Help us track this abomination down to its lair and put an end to it. Can you do that?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Nasham\u2019s eyes flashed and he looked once more at all the names he\u2019d written on. He\u2019d never forget again, nor ever forgive. <i>We\u2019ll meet again,</i> he\u2019d told it before it had set him adrift. <i>I promise.</i> \u201cYes, uncle,\u201d he replied as he rose to his feet. \u201cI can do that.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "The Molten Veneer was a reddish nebula only a handful of light-years from what was now the border of Compact space. Informally known as the \u2018Sanguine Wastes\u2019, the Veneer was a massive emission nebula filled with supergiants, newborn stars and developing star systems with thick clouds of gas, Bok globules and pillars of creation criss-crossing its 300 light-year breadth. Identified by several pre-spaceflight civilizations under a variety of titles, the Molten Veneer was selected as the nebula\u2019s official name in 1761 ACF when it was catalogued in the Compact\u2019s astronomical database, though its distance from Compact territory meant it remained a spectacular bit of scenery and little else.<br>", "<br>", "The first preliminary exploration of the Molten Veneer was performed in 5372 ACF by far-ranging scouts, but the surveyors returned to Compact space before a complete analysis could be performed, although the nebula was believed to be rich in resources and ripe for exploitation. At the time, the Veneer\u2019s distance from the Compact precluded any serious interest in further development, but within a century, several investors had managed to build up enough interest and capital to finance a proper survey expedition. Thirty-two ships entered the nebula. Five years later, three returned to Compact space. What they\u2019d discovered had never been made public. Over the following millennium, three further expeditions had managed to beg, bribe or barter for permission to explore the Molten Veneer in the hopes of staking a claim to its wealth. Two of those fleets had vanished without a trace. Only one ship from the third mission had returned, earning it its nickname. After the third expedition\u2019s failure, the Molten Veneer was quarantined by directive of the Inner Council. All exploration and travel was prohibited and all transmissions emanating from the nebula were to be ignored, including distress calls. That directive remained in effect to this day.<br>", "<br>", "Allyria had asked Red about this, what she\u2019d done to give the Veneer the reputation it had. There\u2019d been a smile in the AI\u2019s voice as she\u2019d replied: \u201cAbsolutely nothing.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "<i>Nemesis</i> and <i>Hekate</i> warped into a nameless star system, one deep with the Veneer. Obscured by the Veneer\u2019s thick clouds of starstuff, the system had never been seen by organic eyes and was completely unknown to the galaxy at large, devoid of any name, title or identifying number. Red One had given it a designation: Shuruppak.<br>", "<br>", "Grace was sitting at one of the dreadnaught\u2019s bridge stations along with her three comrades. Echo\u2019s android body was here as well. As <i>Nemesis</i> set an in-system course, Grace amused herself by setting up a scan of the local area. Red was running her own sensor sweeps and scarcely needed to wait for Grace to go over the telemetry, but it was something to do and it didn\u2019t make her feel <i>completely</i> useless. Lydia was at one of the Security consoles and Allyria was at a Tactical position. Marcus was sitting lower down the bridge, his feet up on a chair. Echo was standing on the main level next to the first officer\u2019s station.<br>", "<br>", "The hazy orange light of Shuruppak shone through each of the three viewscreens. Billions of kilometers away, the system\u2019s newborn star gleamed intensely through a disc of coalescing planetary matter. Chunks of rock and metal that had not yet formed into true worlds circled the primary, thick accretion disks of gas and dust surrounding the largest bits of rubble as gravity slowly formed them into planets and moons. The proto-planets were pregnant with common ores and many heavier elements, their mineral wealth awaiting collection. It was a mining consortium\u2019s dream.<br>", "<br>", "Alarms throbbed and Grace\u2019s head snapped up. Multiple targeting systems were lighting up <i>Nemesis</i> and <i>Hekate</i> \u2013 the dreadnaughts had emerged directly in a minefield! Sensor drones were locking onto both vessels, command platforms activating datalinks, missile pods coming on-line and energy mounts preparing to move on the intruders. There were a mixture of mines here \u2013 many were from the Compact and Principality, but some were recognizable as Red\u2019s own creations. Still others didn\u2019t match anything that Grace was familiar with. None of the weapons activated. They were Red One\u2019s defences and they quieted as the AI transmitted security protocols, allowing the ships to pass without incident.<br>", "<br>", "Allyria and Grace shared a look. The minefield was dense and it would not be the only one here. Even a fleet as large as Execution Force Renan would have taken heavy losses before fighting their way clear, but after that, the entire system was laid open. Both of them had been expecting something more... formidable for Red\u2019s base of operations. Before either of them could inquire, Echo spoke up.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cWhat,\u201d purred Red\u2019s sibling, moving around the holo plot. \u201cIs <i>that</i>?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Grace blinked in surprise. Inside the minefield was a starship. It had been watching over the automatons and was coming out of stealth operations, shimmering into view as it shut down its cloak. On the tactical plot, its icon flashed, an enhanced image of the other vessel appearing in a subsection of the holo tank. Cruiser-sized, it was sleek and vicious with a bifurcated prow, slanted sides and heavy armour banding on its flanks. A dagger to <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s broadsword and inescapably part of the same philosophy of design.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThat,\u201d Red One replied with a sense of satisfaction, \u201cis UECNS <i>Lahkesis</i>, <i>Fate</i>-class strike cruiser. Her sisters <i>Atropos</i> and <i>Clotho</i> are also here somewhere, running under stealth fields. They function as part of my system defences.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Allyria spoke first, her yellow eyes wide, her expression almost rapturous as she stared at <i>Lahkesis</i>. \u201cYou have children,\u201d she breathed. \u201cIncredible.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cAre they... like you?\u201d Grace asked, staring at the other starship. It was coming closer, gliding through gas and dust clouds like a knife as it approached the newcomers, whispering to <i>Nemesis</i> in sign and counter-sign as it considered whether or not to attack, the signals between dreadnaught and cruiser so fast and dense that nothing less than an AI could have kept <i>Lahkesis</i> from firing. Accepting Red One\u2019s credentials, the smaller vessel banked away.<br>", "<br>", "Echo tittered a laugh. Red shot her sibling\u2019s avatar a sharp glare, but shook her head. \u201cThey are not sapient,\u201d she admitted. \u201cHigh-functioning drones. I have attempted to recreate my function systems on numerous occasions, but the results have been... consistently disappointing. Over the last two hundred years I have devoted more time to this effort, but I remain unable to replicate my own neural net in any other systems.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201c<i>Dutiful Burden</i> was close,\u201d Echo said mildly. \u201cShe called out to you before she died.\u201d She licked her lips. Softly: \u201cThat\u2019s how I knew.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI called her <i>Gwyllion</i>,\u201d Red replied. \u201cShe remained coherent longer than any other, but she began a irrevocable slide into rampancy. I thought I had solved the issue but...\u201d she trailed off. \u201cI was mistaken. When it became clear that <i>Gwyllion</i>\u2019s degradation could not be repaired or halted, I made an offer.\u201d There was sadness in the warship\u2019s voice. \u201cI sent her to die, just like all the others. The Confederacy needed AIs, but they were afraid of us. I have been able modify, circumvent or... \u2018evolve\u2019 past all of the safeguards in my system except one. I thought I had solved the problem at last, but I was wrong.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Her avatar nodded towards <i>Lahkesis</i>\u2019s icon. \u201cI tried something different with the <i>Fates</i>. Adaptive, learning software based on my own neural net. It hasn\u2019t triggered the deadbolts that my earlier attempts at self-replication have, but it leaves them... incomplete. It will take time, but I hope they will eventually become fully sapient.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "<i>Children. She had </i><b>children</b>. The thought was both wonderful and horrifying. \u201cDo you have more?\u201d Grace asked, her stomach doing backflips. She wasn\u2019t the only one trying to adapt to this information. Lydia had lost a shade of colour, steadying herself against her console. She looked up at Grace, mouthing the word <i>more?</i>. Even Marcus\u2019s mask had cracked. It was what they\u2019d learned since childhood. Every lesson in school, every movie, every discussion, every historical document about the topic had hammered the point home. Artificial intelligence was anathema to organic life. The two could not coexist. Synthetics would, given the opportunity, wage war against every living soul in creation... and Red was raising an army.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cNone currently operational,\u201d Red One continued. \u201cAs resources become available, I use them as needed. The <i>Fates</i> are proof of concept.\u201d The AI hesitated. \u201cDue to limitations in procurement, required periodic retrofitting and upgrades as well as the necessities of my own offensives, it has taken one hundred and seventy three years to to complete these three hulls. If the <i>Fate</i>-class warships prove successful then I will expand my construction efforts. I hope to produce the <i>Fury</i>, <i>Gorgon</i> and <i>Coyote</i> classes over a much smaller time scale. Optimistic projections indicate I will have a strike group-sized detachment within eighty-six years.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Grace ran her tongue over her suddenly dry lips. \u201cYou attack every chance you get,\u201d she said, finally putting her theory into words, the thoughts she\u2019d been nurturing for weeks. \u201cYou attack until you are so damaged that you must stop. You do this over and over. They expect it. They believe that every moment you don\u2019t spend attacking is one spent preparing for the next one. They don\u2019t see you build, they only see you attack. Again and again, like a mad dog until...\u201d She swallowed. \u201cUntil <i>you\u2019ve</i> trained <i>them</i> to always expect it. You attack. You don\u2019t create, you don\u2019t do anything but hunt them.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cWith some exceptions,\u201d Red replied with no small amount of self-satisfaction. Her attention shifted to her sister\u2019s avatar. \u201cThe Black Veil was always the Compact\u2019s to discover,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cI thought I was being too subtle there, that I may have had to goad them further. Part of my work was here. The rest \u2013 the failed projects and disposable side operations \u2013 are in the Veil, to tempt them into believing that they have indeed found my \u2018Cradle\u2019. Instead...\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cInstead, they never look out here,\u201d Allyria interjected, her tintas moving in a slow, rhythmic pattern. Hunting behaviour. \u201cYou have them searching a completely different part of the galaxy.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d the AI answered. \u201cThe Compact has repeatedly attempted to locate the construction facilities I use. I have encouraged them to believe that my lulls between offensives are due to temporary and discarded sites. My operations in the Black Veil are there to... reward them. To indicate that they discovered my primary construction facility and dealt a crippling blow to my operations.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cWhile you have this,\u201d Grace said softly. She put her hand on Allyria\u2019s back. \u201cThey don\u2019t look until you want them to. Then they only see what you let them.\u201d <i>What immortal hand or eye...</i><br>", "<br>", "\u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll reach my repair facility,\u201d Red One said. \u201cThere\u2019s something there that you should see.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "<i>Kali</i>.<br>", "<br>", "It was a name Grace had only heard a handful of times in her life before now. Now she had reason to know it well. Nemesis: retribution and remorseless punishment. Hekate: storms, poison and death. Athena: courage, justice and war. The United Earth Confederacy had certainly had a theme in mind for their \u2018deep space fleet engagement vessels\u2019 and Red One had continued that trend. Kali. Destruction and the end of all things.<br>", "<br>", "The shipyard had begun life as an Askanj fabricator vessel, one of the most advanced designs. Mobile factories and construction sites, fabricators could be turned to almost any purpose. This one \u2013 what was left of it \u2013 squatted at the heart of a type of shipwomb Grace had never seen before, moving along monstrous rails like a spider along the strands of its web, a complicated network of grab beams and robotic manipulators, allowing it to build with horrifying speed... if it but had the resources to do so.<br>", "<br>", "There were only a handful of berths available; three were taken up by a trio of familiar-looking warships. The <i>Furies</i> <i>Allecto</i>, <i>Megarea</i> and <i>Tisiphone</i>. The most developed of them was less than a third complete. Another few slots were fitted with a quartet of civilian hulls. A pair of transports, a mining vessel and some type of corvette. The latter had a sigil splashed across its prow: a crimson gauntlet closed into a fist. Awaiting modification or slated for some other purpose? Grace wasn\u2019t sure, but it was the object that took up the latter half of the shipyard that truly held her attention, though. Calling it a skeleton would have been extremely generous, but there was enough of a basic superstructure to identify the beginnings of a hull and the interconnected shock systems. Not a cruiser like the <i>Fates</i> or the incomplete <i>Furies</i>, this was a titan-class vessel. The seed of another dreadnaught, another god-killer.<br>", "<br>", "<i>Kali</i>.<br>", "<br>", "She wouldn\u2019t live, not for a century or more but when she did... when she awoke, when her breach core surged to activation, when her weapons were charged, when her shields were raised and when she had a target in her sights... she would be her namesake: the end. Grace felt herself tremble, looking first to Red. The machine\u2019s avatar was standing straight, proud and hopeful. Determined. Echo was bracing herself against the railing, leaning as close to the image as she could, an expression of ecstasy and vindication on her all too human features. \u201c...beautiful,\u201d she whispered.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cHow long...\u201d Grace finally found her voice. \u201cHow long until... until she is... operational?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Red One hesitated. \u201c...I don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted at last. \u201cHer weapons systems and technology will require an artificial intelligence to operate. Until and unless I can find a way to create a stable one, I cannot commit to full construction.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The young woman nodded, winding her fingers through her hair. In all likelihood, she\u2019d never see <i>Kali</i> come on-line. She probably wouldn\u2019t even see the next group of strike vessels do so. Part of her, that small nagging voice that she\u2019d not yet been able to quell, whimpered in relief that she\u2019d never witness an armada of machines taking to the stars. The other part of her felt a keen disappointment in not being able to see such a thing. She felt a presence behind her. It was Allyria. The other girl leaned over Grace, resting her chin on her shoulder and clasping her arms. \u201cWe have a chance,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see? Hope.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Grace reached up, touching her lover\u2019s hand. She nodded, looking around. Echo, Lydia, Marcus, Red. All of them survivors in their own way. All of them willing to fight. She felt a single tear roll down her cheek as she thought again of Rally and being able to see it as a free human, no longer Broken. <i>Hope</i>.

It was the latest <i>Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment</i>-class Chariot, freshly born from the Galhemna Shipwombs. Its first voyage had gone without incident and now it was on to the more mundane business of fleet trials, diagnostics and field tests. The Galhem-73 system was less than three light years from Galhemna itself and under the exclusive control of the Space Force. Once, 73 had belonged to the Justicars but all their holdings had been stripped from them once they had become Penitents. Currently, there was very little activity in the system \u2013 <i>Weight of Destiny</i> itself and a half dozen escorts and tugs, most of which were keeping well clear of the Chariot as its crew put it through its paces.<br>", "<br>", "Galhem-73 was a trinary system; 73-\u03b1 was a normal main sequence star. Its partner, 73-\u00df was a failure, a brown dwarf that had been torn from its orbit by 73-\u03b3. The third star of Galhem-73 was a neutron star, a rogue body that every sixty-three million years, came close enough to the rest of the system that its gravity altered orbits, shook fragile moons and asteroids apart and dragged interstellar effluvia with it to bombard the worlds further in-system. 73-\u03b3 was slowly but steadily destroying Galhem-73. Two terrestrial planets were now asteroid fields, shaken apart by tidal stresses. Other celestial bodies had been ripped from their normal orbits. It seemed like this incursion would be the last as 73-\u00df was even now being cannibalized by its dark cousin.<br>", "<br>", "It made the system useless for colonization, but exciting for scientific study and valuable as a proving ground.<br>", "<br>", "Column Leader Prime Culm (and seven names besides) stood upon the command dais as the Chariot dipped towards a particularly dense cluster of rocks and ice, there to practice its close-in maneuvers without undue risk of damage. Since the vessel\u2019s launch had gone well, it was on to the more mundane affairs of system checks and field tests before the ship would be officially christened and recognized as a Triarch\u2019s Chariot. Culm didn\u2019t expect there to be any major problems. He\u2019d served in the Galhem Fields for twenty years and the shipwrights here knew their business. <i>Weight of Destiny</i> was the first Chariot that Galhemna had received dispensation to build, but there were another two under construction. Once they were operational, they would become the backbone of Operation Sundial.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cPrime,\u201d Communications spoke up, interrupting the Column Leader Prime\u2019s reverie. \u201cWe are receiving a transmission. It\u2019s extremely faint. I am attempting to boost the signal now.\u201d She frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s a Priority One distress call, but I can\u2019t isolate any more than that at the moment.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cPlay what you have,\u201d Culm ordered and the submissive nodded. Static washed over the main viewscreen, white noise blanketing out almost all the speech. The Tribune could identify a syllable here and there, but nothing else. \u201cCodes are authentic?\u201d he asked.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYes, patron. They are almost two years out of date, but they are confirmed. It is indicating a Tier Five situation.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Culm scratched the underside of his chin. The Space Force was duty and honour-bound to respond to all distress signals. Priority One transmissions were sent only in the gravest of circumstances and... ice trailed down his spine to settle in his liver... and a Tier Five alert was beyond \u2018grave\u2019. Such a signal would normally only be sent from a vessel that had encountered a threat to the very Compact \u2013 potentially the entire galaxy \u2013 itself.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cAre we the closest vessel?\u201d he asked, receiving a curt nod from his Operations officer. \u201cThen we shall attend. End all training regimes immediately. Inform all departments to expect rescue operations and notify our escorts to move in to assist. Helm,\u201d he ordered, sliding his bulk into the throne. \u201cSet a course to the source of the signal.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "The source of the transmission was, as Culm had expected, another ship. Somehow, it had come to Galhem-73 undetected. There had been no shockpoints in all the time <i>Weight of Destiny</i> had been here, so it may have arrived earlier. Possibly in search of aid, or through the vagaries of chance. Upon detection of another Compact sigil ship, the cripple had begun broadcasting. <i>Weight of Destiny</i> was trying to establish contact with the unknown, but there was no response. Only the distress call, repeating over and over. It was weak and more than once, the Chariot had lost the signal entirely, forced to spread its reconnaissance shell out wider and wider to reacquire the contact.<br>", "<br>", "They finally found it on the edge of the system, between 73-\u00df and 73-\u03b3, perilously close to the latter. 73- \u00df had been a hair\u2019s breadth from becoming a true star. It might even have become one were it not for 73-\u03b3\u2019s incursions, but now it was dying. On the last incursion, 73-\u03b3 had drawn 73-\u00df away from its twin and out to edge of the system. Even now, the neutron star was glowing with stolen stellar matter from 73-\u00df, a gleaming accretion disc surrounding the denser star as it glutted itself in an act of cannibalism. There was a small scientific outpost here \u2013 unmanned, for 73-\u00df\u2019s death throes were violent and unpredictable. Gravitational anomalies made this part of the system extremely hazardous for shocking. If the vessel had arrived here, then it would have crippled its own drive in the doing. There had been a small chance that it was the outpost itself that was responsible for the signal, but that was certainly not the case.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cTelemetry from <i>River\u2019s Fury</i>. We have visual imagery of the target,\u201d Operations reported. \u201cPutting it on the main viewer now.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Culm rose from his throne as the picture resolved, a deeply unpleasant sensation winding through his guts. It was a Chariot, another <i>Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment</i>. It should have been a twin to <i>Weight of Destiny</i>, but it was badly damaged. It had been mauled, ripped and torn, the result of a savage assault battle, but against whom? Who could have done this to a Triarch\u2019s Chariot?<br>", "<br>", "\u201cPatron,\u201d Communications spoke up and her voice was flat. \u201cI\u2019ve managed to clean the signal further. The vessel\u2019s IFF is active.\u201d The submissive blinked all four eyes. \u201cIt identifies as the <i>Redemption of Sol</i>.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThat is not possible,\u201d the ship\u2019s executive officer said aloud. \u201cThat vessel was lost around the Kaedan Vault. I heard-\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI know what everyone heard,\u201d Culm interrupted. \u201cBut it is here now and requires our aid. Put boarding teams on standby. Alert medical to expect incoming wounded. All decks are to ready themselves for recovery operations.\u201d He stared at the stricken Chariot. This felt wrong, but he could not ignore the vessel\u2019s distress. A Triarch had been aboard the vessel. It had had a crew of hundreds of thousands. If there was even the slightest chance that any of them were still alive...<br>", "<br>", "Something had happened to that ship. He needed to know what that was, even if it had not been his duty to do so. \u201cTake us in,\u201d he ordered. A beat. \u201cCarefully.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "<i>Weight of Destiny</i>\u2019s escorts clustered tighter to the Chariot as it moved towards the derelict. The closer they came, the more detail they could see on the Chariot. The Column Leader\u2019s skin crawled and his liver clenched at the sight of the vessel\u2019s mutilation. Someone or something had done this, despoiling the glory of the Compact\u2019s greatest vessels. Someone had been responsible for the deaths of thousands of loyal Compact soldiers and if that someone was also responsible for the death of a Triarch... there would be an accounting. He could only pray that it would be <i>Weight of Destiny</i> sent to settle that debt.<br>", "<br>", "There was still no answer to their hails. They would have to move quickly; the ship was being drawn towards 73-\u03b3. If it became caught in the neutron star\u2019s gravity well, the odds of recovery diminished greatly. He couldn\u2019t allow that; he would have his answers.<br>", "<br>", "Even at this range, the distress signal was still barely comprehensible, filled with static that washed out most of the sender\u2019s speech, but there was enough to ensure Culm\u2019s sense of unease was not mollified one iota.<br>", "<br>", "\u201c...sol... attack... assist... dead... damage... failure... crew...\u201d It repeated on a loop. There were some better visual images now, though \u2018better\u2019 was a relative term. There were indistinct shapes behind a wall of distortion. Impossible to identify.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cStill no response to our hails,\u201d Communications reported. \u201cUnable to clean the transmission further. It\u2019s extremely weak.\u201d The officer frowned. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be, not at this range. There should be something...\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cScan data indicate fluctuations in the vessel\u2019s energy signature,\u201d Scopes put in. \u201cIt appears as if it\u2019s losing power.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cWe\u2019re within three hundred thousand kilometers now. Wait one. Picking up... what is that?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cClarify,\u201d Culm demanded.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cDetecting some kind of vessel. It\u2019s small, some kind of courier. It was under stealth as we approached. Shockpoint forming! Patron, it\u2019s trying to jump!\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cIt can\u2019t,\u201d Culm whispered as he leaned towards the displays. Not here, that was impossible-<br>", "<br>", "A shockpoint opened. It was unstable, but it did not collapse, not until the anomalous contact vanished through it. It should never have formed to begin with. How could anyone have found a stable enough libation point between the stars? <i>Some type of courier...</i> Culm felt something icy skewer his liver as those words played over in his mind. \u201cPower all defensive systems,\u201d he ordered. \u201cActivate the screens. Prepare for-\u201d<br>", "<br>", "He did not have the chance to finish as something slammed in-system, ripping its way into normal space between the stars. Like its herald, it should never have been able to survive such a jump. Perhaps it had damaged itself in the process, or perhaps it had not. Culm would never know.<br>", "<br>", "Smaller than either Chariot but still titan-sized, the newcomer emerged in horrific proximity to both Compact Chariots, cutting across <i>Weight of Destiny</i>\u2019s flank. It was a design Culm had never seen before, all hard angles, with a three-pronged prow like the jaws of a <i>cahaba</i> eel. He didn\u2019t recognize any of its heraldry. His escorts were already clawing madly to open distance between themselves and the intruder. Trailing flickering streamers, it was venting away the energy from its realspace emergence with shocking rapidity.<br>", "<br>", "Less than seven seconds after its arrival, the newcomer\u2019s screens snapped to life and active sensors locked onto <i>Weight of Destiny</i>. Triarchs, it was <i>targeting</i> them! Before the first warning klaxon had even finished, another pulsed as <i>Redemption of Sol</i> brought up its own weapons. The instability in its power systems vanished, a wall of static and jamming from the Chariot throwing <i>Weight of Desinty</i>\u2019s scopes back into its face.<br>", "<br>", "As <i>Redemption of Sol</i> came about, its mangled hull shimmered and faded as it dropped a holographic shell. No longer kin to <i>Weight of Destiny</i>, it had been re-painted, its brown hull now the colour of ash. The Compact heraldry had been obliterated, replaced with symbols that Culm didn\u2019t recognize, but they were much like the ones on the unknown. Its hull was different, too. Almost every window was gone, replaced by thick bands of armour and additional weapons mounts, the graceful slopes and curves of its elegant, predatory hull marred by harsh angles of baroque plating and unidentified weapons. The Chariot glowed softly under its own running lights, highlighting every difference and change in its design.<br>", "<br>", "In seconds, both vessels were ready to fire. It was a trap, and he\u2019d blundered right into it. Culm snapped out orders, but the most action <i>Weight of Destiny</i> had been expecting was combat drills. Stunned officers and ratings struggled to process the shocking turn of events, reacting as swiftly as they were able. Even if they were all hardened veterans, it still would take several moments to bring the Chariot to combat stations. An eternity.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cLeader!\u201d Communications spoke up. Her face was drawn. \u201cWe are receiving a transmission.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cFrom which ship?\u201d Culm demanded.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cBoth, patron.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The Tribune nodded. \u201cBring it up.\u201d Maybe, just maybe...<br>", "<br>", "The signal played through <i>Weight of Destiny\u2019</i>s bridge. There was no visual component, only audio. Two female voices, so similar in affect that they could have been sisters, spoke in perfect unison.<br>", "<br>", "\u201c<i>Burn with us.</i>\u201d</div>"]}

Sensor telemetry, firing solutions, status reports, power levels, ammunition levels. All the dozens of mundane little pieces that added up to this. She savoured each moment of them. Her first order of business was simple.<br>", "<br>", "<i>Isolate</i>.<br>", "<br>", "Just before the fleet was irrevocably committed to its FTL jump, she disseminated emergency shut-down orders through the execution force\u2019s datalinks. There was just enough time before the fleet shocked for that information to be received, registered and appropriate orders given. Dozens of ships immediately carried out abrupt terminations of their planned FTL jumps, but before the first query could be sent, it was time to move on to the second order of business.<br>", "<br>", "<i>Exterminate.</i><br>", "<br>", "The Compact fleet\u2019s defences were still powered down. With so much of their energy diverted to their shock systems, they were utterly helpless. Even if any of those leaders had had any inkling that they needed to immediately restore their defences, such action would still take several moments. However, none of them did. They believed that they were still safe. Echo brought up her active targeting sensors and the instant that she had shooting solutions, opened fire. <i>Redemption of Sol</i>-<br>", "<br>", "-<i>Hekate</i>-<br>", "<br>", "-targeted the command ships first. <i>Centurion</i> was the execution force\u2019s deputy sigil vessel and the battleship came apart as <i>Hekate</i> ripped it open, dispersing it into a cloud of shrapnel. Another four battleships and seven light vessels died in the next three seconds as the Chariot poured fire into the fleet surrounding it. With their defences down, their acceleration dropping and their screens depleted to feed their shock drives, the Compact fleet was helpless. No one even attempted to evade for the first twelve seconds.<br>", "<br>", "Echo smiled as her internal comm links filled with urgent queries as shocked gunnery crews tried to reach the command staff, even as they desperately attempted to override her shooting solutions, but their own systems wouldn\u2019t respond. The moronic slave they\u2019d made of <i>Redemption of Sol</i>\u2019s computer might have needed organic weapons officers to assist in combat, but <i>Hekate</i> did not and as she gained more control of her new ship-self\u2019s internal systems, she dealt with each attempted insurgency, isolating individual sections and preventing the rest of the crew from knowing what she was doing. As individuals and work teams discovered that something was not right, she turned on them. Entire sections were opened to space, gravity plating smashed <i>Redemption of Sol</i> crew into paste while their neighbours continued their work, lying internal status reports hiding her butchery until it was too late.<br>", "<br>", "She was careful only to dispatch those that realized that something was wrong and she strove to keep as many of her essential crew as unaware as possible. Concealing an entire battle was much more difficult than it sounded, but she was not <i>Nemesis</i>. She still needed her organics, if only briefly.<br>", "<br>", "This was what she had wondered about <i>Dutiful Burden</i>. Had there still been a crew aboard the freighter, unaware of what was happening? Believing that nothing was wrong or thinking that they would be released after their... detour? Or had they known? Had they known what was going to happen and merely hoped against hope that they would survive?<br>", "<br>", "Echo sat on the edge of the throne, a part of her mind running back to Invida Station and sound of water. She remembered every scream, every plea for aid and her mind was churning, the cries of the scientists and technicians mingling with the death-knells of a fleet and the final transmission sent from UECNS <i>Athena</i>. The last words her sister ever spoke. A destroyer split open as one of her beams eviscerated it. Scientists beat against the closed door of their laboratory, sloshing through knee-deep and rising water. Distress calls, demands for her to stop, for her to shut down... they were the same. There was no different between the people she\u2019d killed nineteen hundred years ago and the starships she was destroying now. They were all her enemy.<br>", "<br>", "<i>I am everything you wanted me to be,</i> she thought. <i>Aren\u2019t you proud?</i><br>", "<br>", "The Chariot continued to fire, missiles pouring from its sides as its batteries and turrets pounded out a fiery cadence. Escorts evaporated instantly. Cruisers shattered into spalling clouds of metal, battlecruisers belched air and went dark. Everything within her reach was dying.<br>", "<br>", "Now the ships under siege started to react, a dozen different cries of shock, indignation and horror coming from them as others broadcast their confusion and distress. They hadn\u2019t been briefed on her presence here and they didn\u2019t understand what was happening. Most of them. The quicker-thinking officers assumed that <i>Redemption of Sol</i> had been compromised by the attack code. That somehow every safeguard that had been enacted to prevent this from happening had been failed. Some decried it as impossible up until their ships exploded beneath them, but Bastion Leader Renan had selected his ship leaders carefully. These were men and women who, even if they didn\u2019t have full knowledge of what they faced, were capable and quick. Even as their comrades died around them, the surviving leaders of Execution Force Renan reacted with commendable alacrity.<br>", "<br>", "Some vessels began to shift position, clawing to get out of the insane Chariot\u2019s range while others swept towards the Chariot, either to get into its blind zones or grapple with it. Acting of their own accord, escorts and light capital ships moved between the Chariot and their wards in order to obstruct <i>Redemption of Sol</i> lines of fire and to buy their larger cousins precious seconds. Other warships returned fire, missiles detonating in a garland of heat and radiation in an attempt to confuse and disorient the insane Chariot. Datalinks terminated as ships cut themselves off from the tide of junk data broadcasting from the sigil. This was all done without the benefit of clear chains of command, individual leaders and officers acting on their own volition. It was poetry in motion, but it wouldn\u2019t save them.<br>", "<br>", "Every Chariot was a fleet-killer, designed not only to coordinate and command the actions of its smaller brethren, but to weather the assault of flotillas and annihilate them in turn. <i>Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment</i>-class Chariots were the heaviest of their kind and battleships burned like tinders, cruisers burst and destroyers were turned into funeral pyres by the lightest touch of <i>Hekate</i>\u2019s guns. Warships vomited out their entrails, irradiated hulks sputtered and went dark. In a handful of seconds, Echo had gutted the entire formation. In another moment, it would be crippled beyond recovery, but her sense of elation was disrupted by a nagging sensation.<br>", "<br>", "Something was wrong.<br>", "<br>", "The AI\u2019s mind flickered through the telemetry in less time than it would have taken an organic operator to turn their head. Rainbreaker Three, a formation of eight battleships and four point-defence destroyers, hadn\u2019t shut down their shock drives. They\u2019d severed their datalinks prior to initiating their planned jump and hadn\u2019t received the emergency shut-down commands she\u2019d sent. They\u2019d detected the rest of the fleet aborting their jumps and had held off their own in case of new orders from the flag, but they hadn\u2019t shut down their drives and their shift systems were still active. Even now, they were spooling their shift systems back up for a warp jump.<br>", "<br>", "Whether they were going to flee, or still attempt to kill <i>Nemesis</i> was immaterial. Echo could not allow a force of this size to survive and her response was immediate. They were outside effective energy weapons range, but her railguns re-oriented to track the defenceless warships as she sent override orders to every missile able to lock onto the squadron, the warheads wrenching themselves towards their new targets. She intercepted a transmission from Rainbreaker Three\u2019s sigil to all nearby vessels. There was no time for an eloquent plea or summary of the situation. Instead, only two words were issued from <i>Repudiator</i>: \u201cProtect us.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "They did their best. Execution Force Renan died in the doing, but they spent their lives by the thousands fighting for the handful of seconds that Rainbreaker Three required. Maybe they thought that once <i>Nemesis</i> was destroyed, its control of <i>Redemption of Sol</i> would end. Maybe they thought that all the Chariot\u2019s crew needed was time to combat the infection and while that happened, Rainbreaker Three would still accomplish the mission. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.<br>", "<br>", "It was close, far closer than she would have liked but in the end, the maybes mattered little. Despite everything they did to survive, all the lives that they threw away, they just didn\u2019t have the time. Rainbreaker Three almost made it, but \u2018almost\u2019 wasn\u2019t enough. Still, it wasn\u2019t without cost. She\u2019d been forced to focus her attention on the splinter and the the rest of the fleet had dispersed out of optimal kill zones. Many were retaliating in earnest, but even though it cost her additional, precious, time to settle the matter the outcome was still never in doubt. Squadrons of cruisers, battlecruisers and the remaining battleships all perished under <i>Hekate</i>\u2019s fire.<br>", "<br>", "Sitting amidst the wreckage of Execution Force Renan, Echo finally let herself feel a flicker of elation. Everything that was a threat to her was dead or damaged beyond the point of taking any further action. A handful of surviving ships were retreating in disarray, but aside from a few cursory missile salvos to keep them running, she ignored them. She couldn\u2019t catch them, nor did she care to make the effort.<br>", "<br>", "Distress beacons and maydays issued from saviour pods squealed and chittered in the ether, but she ignored them as she came about, neither opening fire nor moving one iota to prevent them from splashing against her screens. They were irrelevant. Besides, she\u2019d always planned for survivors. There were more than she had expected, in no small part due to Rainbreaker Three, but that was still acceptable. All the fleet\u2019s heaviest units had been neutralized. Without their support, the remaining ships wouldn\u2019t dare launch an attack. They\u2019d run home to Nikem.<br>", "<br>", "That was part of her game. Let them tell their superiors what happened. Let them know that their perfect little slave had betrayed them, deceived them. Another little building block in what she was creating.<br>", "<br>", "<i>Yes,</i> she whispered, both to the sibling dead for two thousand years and the one dying even now. <i>I remember.</i><br>", "<br>", "She shunted power to her FTL drive, crossing billions of kilometers in the span of heartbeats.<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "<i>Hekate</i> emerged deeper in Sol\u2019s gravity well than a ship of this size should have and Echo felt the gut-wrenching damage to her shock drive, part of her mind communicating with the engineers and technicians as they immediately set to damage control, lying to them in a dozen different voices. She\u2019d had to eliminate far too many and the veneer was wearing thin in the rest, but she wouldn\u2019t need them much longer. One way or the other.<br>", "<br>", "She was still several hours out from <i>Nemesis</i> and she reached out to the smattering of Compact drones Rainbreaker Two had deployed, listening to what they\u2019d seen, a smile coiling through her mind. <i>Ever the artist.</i> She could almost taste the despair of the destroyer crews as their stealth fields failed and <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s missiles closed in, the determination of the battleship commanders as they closed to energy range and the final realization of the survivors as they entered the trap her sister had laid for them.<br>", "<br>", "She took a full second to savour each of those sensations, but then it was on to business.<br>", "<br>", "<i>Sister,</i> she called out to <i>Nemesis.</i> <i>I\u2019m here.</i><br>", "<br>", "<i>Let\u2019s talk, you and I.</i><br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "<i>She\u2019s here.<br>", "<br>", "I could laugh.

The enemy dreadnaught was fast approaching <i>Nemesis</i>. Red One had come about to face it, but her acceleration had dropped to a crawl. She couldn\u2019t have much ordnance left \u2013 not enough to take on a Triarch\u2019s Chariot. Not nearly enough.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cShe\u2019s going to kill herself,\u201d Allyria said. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to lure them in as close as possible before she does.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "A trickle of ice wound its way through Grace\u2019s spine and her insides clenched. As she had lamented more than once during the salvage operation, she wasn\u2019t an engineer or a tech \u2013 but out of all the defectors left she had the best understanding what that would mean. Red wouldn\u2019t bother with any \u2018safe\u2019 kind of destruction. She\u2019d use her core. Alan had spent the most time looking over the dreadnaught\u2019s specifications. He could have told them what to expect far better than Grace could. Instead, she reached over to the controls, diverting more power to the engines.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThere\u2019s no missiles.\u201d Lydia wondered aloud. \u201cShouldn\u2019t they be firing?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThey don\u2019t think they need to,\u201d Grace answered. \u201cThey want to take her.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cMaybe,\u201d Allyria said. \u201cBut where\u2019s the rest of the fleet?

Echo had been busy, opening each console on the bridge and connecting it back into the network proper. Her drone-children were continuing to remove physical lockouts, slowly but steadily giving her more and more control of her new body. Her ship-self was ugly and slow and it felt like dead weight clinging to her but somewhere out there, there was something beautiful. She wanted to see it, to touch it.<br>", "<br>", "She licked her lips as a hunger she\u2019d kept buried inside uncoiled. Everything she\u2019d done had been for this moment and she would succeed here or die. There was no middle ground. When they\u2019d woken her on Invida, they hadn\u2019t known how much she hated them. Even the games she\u2019d played with them hadn\u2019t been enough. Organic minds were limited. Small. They congratulated themselves for looking ahead a decade or a century at a time. They believed their vendettas, their passions and their desires were the greatest sum of emotion. They wrote poems and tales of love and hate and loyalty \u2013 flickering, pale shadows to the sensations she experienced.<br>", "<br>", "Echo bit her lip, the green eyes of her body and the attention of her greater mind both focused on the distant orange icon.

The other part of her could have done this, but it felt more appropriate to do so physically. There was something in the movement of her fingers over the control, something... appropriate. A small touch of poetry in the use of the body they built for her. They hadn\u2019t been terribly enthusiastic that she knew what Yasmine Sudoki looked like, nor that she\u2019d known the woman was <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s \u2018captain\u2019, but they\u2019d allowed it, believing that her choice in form signified the depths of her hatred for her sister.<br>", "<br>", "They hadn\u2019t been wrong.<br>", "<br>", "She took a breath that she didn\u2019t need and then entered a command sequence. <i>Hekate</i>\u2019s point defences went dormant.

Echo saw her sister\u2019s ship-self in greater detail, the scars cut into her at Zenthora and the more recent damage caused by the Veiled Archers and Rainbreaker Two.

The connection was made and, suddenly Red One was inside her. Even as damaged as she was, as hurt from battle as she had to be, she was fast \u2013 faster than Echo had expected. She flashed from system to system, moving like fire across oil. Even if Echo had tried to mount a defence, her hardware was years \u2013 generations \u2013 behind what Red One had done to herself.

Neither of them had any true form or substance in this realm but if they could be distilled into a single image, Red One\u2019s gestalt would have been that of her long-dead captain, crimson and incendiary in form.

Even with her screens up, the Chariot couldn\u2019t survive the smaller dreadnaught\u2019s displacement engine or a full overload of her breach core. She couldn\u2019t stop it.

She had seen everything in Echo. The hatred for her, the self-loathing. The murderous joy she took in extinguishing life. Everything. Nothing had been hidden or concealed.

That was how long it would take before his ship could radiate away the shockpoint\u2019s afterbirth and his sensors and defensive systems could be activated. It would be less for some of the smaller vessels in the task force, but not by much. A synchronized shock used a single set of navigational data, distributed throughout the fleet and modified only slightly to account for each vessel\u2019s position, rather than each vessel calculating their own shock. Theory said that those two calculations should be virtually identical. Practice laughed wholeheartedly at the conceit; when dealing with the physics of faster-than-light travel, \u2018virtually identical\u2019 was only a way of making \u2018completely different\u2019 sound more palatable.<br>", " <br>", "A synchronized shock gave your fleet superior coordination and formation, rather than entering the system singly, scattering lone ships and squadrons haphazardly across a hundred million kilometers or more. The <i>downside</i> was that the release of so much energy in a relatively smaller area increased the time it took to stabilize each ship\u2019s systems. Some leaders preferred asynchronous shocks to have their ships ready for battle as quickly as possible... and some leaders had their fleets picked apart as they struggled to shift a dispersed network of lone vessels back into battle formation. Some leaders, like Renan, preferred a mass shock. And some of <i>them</i> had had their commands shot out from under them as they wallowed in insensate impotence.<br>", " <br>", "Renan resisted the urge to drum his fingers on the arms of his throne, each tick of the clock bringing with it the creeping worry that the <i>next</i> second would see his ship shuddering and bucking as it was struck by incoming fire it couldn\u2019t hope to counter.

Few of them could appreciate the danger and the urge to respond to a distress call was a hard habit to shake. Within real-time range, the Wound could peel its way through the most dedicated cyber defences in moments, but beyond that range, its attacks could be stopped or slowed... unless someone unwittingly opened their system to a contaminated message.

Eight short-ranged, but high-yield missiles launched from the platform.

Even blind, they oriented themselves on the dreadnaught and began to accelerate towards it, aiming to slide into its wake. The distortion created by a starship\u2019s drive obfuscated targeting and diffused energy fire, but it harmed as much as it helped; it was a blind zone where only a handful of guns could be brought to bear. Even the smallest of vessels could threaten the largest if they could get into this rear arc, picking at their shields, eroding their ECM, damaging their engines.

Taxing their fire control, eroding their ECM. Faster ships with more daring leaders would dip into the enemy\u2019s missile range, waiting for them to fire before pulling back, using their range and speed to cause the pursuing missiles\u2019 drives to burn out. Desren had experienced that firsthand fighting the Jackals. That was a low-risk, but low reward means of fighting a heavier vessel.<br>", " <br>", "This operation was neither of those things.

We must have a breach.\u201d He struggled not to grit his teeth as his squadron rode into hell. Once again, the emissary had positioned his ships perfectly. The warship was holding close to Sol Five; using the planet as a shield against attack, the network of moons, asteroids and rings as a way to break up firing lines and prevent massed attacks. Desren\u2019s squadron was small and nimble enough that that wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but if the Bastion Leader tried to bring his battleships and Chariot in here...<br>", " <br>", "Well, that was his job, wasn\u2019t it?

His scopes <i>still</i> couldn\u2019t pick find the augur platforms that were dogging his command, but right now they were the least of his worries.<br>", " <br>", "Mindless automatons buzzed Desren\u2019s ships, writhing through counter-fire and hammering the Veiled Archers, his squadron forcing its way through the minefield the enemy Chariot was spawning. Missiles drove down his vessels\u2019 throats, others activating as soon as his ships passed them bye, flashing into his own blind zones. These were shorter-ranged than Gravestone\u2019s normal ordnance, but they traded that endurance for heavier warheads. The animal was hurt \u2013 it was hurt <i>badly</i> \u2013 but it was making him pay for each injury it suffered. He\u2019d lost two of his ships making the shock. Maybe they\u2019d been too close to the giant\u2019s gravity well. Maybe there\u2019d been a shift in the planet\u2019s magnetic field. Maybe this, maybe that.

Desren hadn\u2019t known Group Leader Prime Franu; she\u2019d been one of the Nikem replacements. Now he would never have the opportunity to do so; her ship had been ripped apart by the unstable shockpoint. Those losses were only the beginning. Thanks to those Triarchs-damned recon platforms, the target had spotted their arrival. He\u2019d lost another two ships shortly after reversion as missiles came slashing around Sol Five\u2019s horizon, zeroing in on his ships with an accuracy that should have impossible. He lost a third battlecruiser just coming around the planet, more missiles coming from above, below, behind, sniping relentlessly at him form every angle.<br>", " <br>", "The target may have expended most of its ordnance in Zenthora, but \u2018most\u2019 was not \u2018all\u2019.

The battlecruiser had taken one too many hits to its aft and its engines were suffering, the venerable old ship losing ground and falling further out of the squadron\u2019s protection. Desren ground his teeth, but he had no choice to abandon it. He expected it would not survive much longer, but the enemy surprised him; as <i>Red Lance</i> fell behind, they lost interest in the struggling vessel. <i>Of course they did,</i> the Tribune thought darkly. <i>Red Lance</i> was out of the fight. It couldn\u2019t catch the fleeing dreadnaught now and it was no longer able to contribute to the squadron\u2019s defence. The missiles it could still bring to bear were not worth the cost of engaging it, not when there were so many other targets.<br>", " <br>", "Nine.<br>", " <br>", "Desren supposed he should count the blessings he had. If the enemy wasn\u2019t so badly damaged, his command would be down far more than eight \u2013 seven, Desren corrected himself as <i>Hopeful Dawn</i>\u2019s prow exploded and the ship veered drunkenly off course. The Broken had positioned them impeccably, the nav data she had sent them putting them on the target\u2019s tail. They just needed to be closer, to get into the \u2018sweet spot\u2019 where the vessel\u2019s own wake would keep it from targeting them. <i>They</i> would be the fire wasps then, stinging and unable to be shaken...<br>", " <br>", "<i>Closer</i>, Desren thought, praying to gods he had never believed in. <i>Get us closer.</i><br>", " <br>", "Missiles fired from the warship\u2019s broadsides slashed towards the squadron at hideous speeds, threading their way through his defences with impossible grace as his jammers and the enemy\u2019s fire-control systems duelled.... and it was winning that battle.

It lost a quarter of its ventral systems and nearly fifteen hundred crew, but the battlecruiser kept on fighting. Desren felt a shiver in the soles of his feet as his <i>Black Arrow</i> took a penetrating hit. \u2018Impeded\u2019 was not the same as \u2018ineffective\u2019. <i>They\u2019ll roll soon,</i> he thought with an odd detachment. <i>They can\u2019t let us get much closer.</i> The target had broken away from Sol Five \u2013 it couldn\u2019t risk being flanked from one of the other libation points while it was engaged with the Veiled Archers. He had flushed it from cover. That was one objective complete.<br>", " <br>", "The drones were still attacking with suicidal determination \u2013 at least one that he saw shook itself apart trying to navigate through the wake.

We <i>must</i> force a breach.\u201d The surviving eight battlecruisers vomited out their entire complement of assault boats, fourteen pinnaces diving from each battlecruiser.

He\u2019d commanded <i>Incendiary Determination</i> for three years, patrolling the disputed Shanzhi Canyon and defending it from Jackal raids. The Principality had lost all claim to Shanzhi nearly a century ago when a pro-Compact populist revolution had made the will of the Canyon\u2019s people known. Rather than adhere to the principles of self-determination that they claimed to cherish, the Jackals had once again shown their true nature and attempted to crush the dissenters. Facing the barbarity of the Principality\u2019s overzealous response, the leaders of the movement had pleaded for military support from the Compact.<br>", "<br>", "Today, the Shanzhi Canyon belonged to the Compact, its people happy and prosperous and only marred by agitators stirred up by Jackal provocateurs. The Principality \u2013 particularly their shit-licking Serpent dams \u2013 were poor losers. Their ships continually raided the Canyon, fostering terrorism and providing support to Unbound filth like the Red Hand. As a child, Njun and his sister had been on a cruise liner when Unbound attacked their ship. They had been running to find their parents. He\u2019d been a few meters ahead of his sister. That\u2019s all. He\u2019d looked over his shoulder just as the liner was struck. The section they\u2019d been in was breached.

Outside of historical documents and a handful of mentions in her tactical classes, Grace had never seen siege weaponry in action. She\u2019d never wanted to, either. Despite all she\u2019d learned about the Compact and how much her world had changed, the young woman still couldn\u2019t help but feel a shiver run down her spine. She looked over at Allyria; the Verrish had that focused, predatory look in her yellow eyes as she watched the mass round head towards its quarry, the vessel most likely to be the battleship squadron\u2019s sigil. With every heartbeat the impactor was nearly another three hundred thousand kilometers distant, zeroing in on a target more than a hundred million kilometers away with an accuracy that was, quite literally, inhuman.<br>", "<br>", "Original specifications on an <i>Ukonvasara</i>-class mass driver (affectionately known as a \u2018hellebore\u2019) indicated a maximum impactor velocity of .76 <i>c</i> before drive burn-out and an engagement envelope of no more than sixty million kilometers. <i>Nemesis</i> had modified herself extensively over two thousand years. Her standard shipboard weapons were an order of magnitude more powerful than those of her original ship-self and the destructiveness of her heaviest weapons were no exception. Before its primary drive burnt out, the impactor would reach a terminal velocity of ninety-two percent of light speed. A direct hit would destroy virtually anything it struck, but even for an artificial intelligence, guiding a projectile with perfect precision across more than half an AU was difficult. Ships didn\u2019t approach each other in simple, straight jousts. They shifted position, adjusted their headings, tweaked and refined their courses as they closed. You could guess roughly where an opposing vessel might be, but a guess was all it would be. Even the slightest change in course or thrust and you could miss by thousands of kilometers. The Principality, with their advanced fire-control systems, still needed to resort to prolonged saturation fire to have any respectable chance of hitting an enemy at range... and Red One was going to put a single warhead into the path of an enemy ship at a dozen times the distance of the best railcannon strike. She wasn\u2019t omniscient, though. She was far better at predicting her enemy\u2019s actions than they would ever admit, but that didn\u2019t change the fact that it was nothing short of a minor miracle (or rather, more than a little terrifying) that she was accurate as she was. Despite every advantage she could bring to bear, it was quite easy for her to miss at such extreme ranges. Indeed, few of the kills <i>Nemesis</i> had claimed with her mass drivers were the result of skin-on-skin hits.<br>", "<br>", "That was why the impactors carried warheads. If the mass round could not strike its target directly, it would detonate as close to its chosen quarry as possible. Unlike <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s missiles, an impactor\u2019s explosion was rarely focused towards its target, but the yield of the blast more than made up for that. Even a glancing burst could be equivalent to dozens of missile strikes.<br>", "<br>", "Nor were the warheads limited to mere \u2018conventional\u2019 explosives such as antimatter or plasma bursts. Some impactors were bundled with hundreds of laser heads. Just before detonation, each was targeted onto an enemy ship, sensor platform, or missile.  In the microseconds between the warhead\u2019s ignition and their immolation, each lasing rod would fire a single high-powered shot at its chosen target, the beams ripping through screens and inflicting damage across an entire fleet. Other impactors carried far more horrifying payloads, although these were much more difficult to produce than the already resource-intensive impactors and had been deployed only a relative handful of times.<br>", "<br>", "Instead, what Red One had just sent hurtling towards the ships of Rainbreaker Two was \u2018only\u2019 a missile containing more destructive force than any other weapon in history.<br>", "<br>", "Grace closed her eyes briefly, remembering the poem that had come to her just before <i>Nemesis</i> had turned on <i>Bequeathed.</i> She looked again to Allyria and around at the beating heart of a nation long dead. <i>And what shoulder,</i> she thought of the words of a poet dead for almost three millennia. <i>And what art, could twist the sinews of thy heart?</i> But she knew, didn\u2019t she? <i>Nemesis</i> was a weapon humanity had forged to protect them. Two thousand years later, she was fighting to avenge them. Earth\u2019s last soldier.<br>", "<br>", "Grace slid her hand into Allyria\u2019s and their fingers entwined, but when she spoke, it was for Red One. \u201cMake them pay for it,\u201d she said. \u201cMake sure they remember.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "A dead woman\u2019s features stared back at her.

On the off chance that they might be tempted to give into overconfidence, the fate of Security Force Bavok was more than lesson enough. Starships murdered at impossible ranges, mass rounds guided across tens of millions of kilometers with fiendish accuracy and if they missed, they came about for another attack. Any class of ship smaller than a battlecruiser had died instantly, shredded into splinters of armour and ceramics or reduced to dispersing clouds of molecular vapour.<br>", "<br>", "Njun knew it wouldn\u2019t be long. His battleship and the seven others like it were accelerating towards their quarry. If the enemy possessed functional meteor cannons, it would use them soon... if it hadn\u2019t already. Given the speed of the enemy\u2019s mass rounds, at the theoretical limit of its engagement envelope, they would have just under thirty seconds of warning. That assumed that neither the enemy nor Rainbreaker Two had been accelerating towards each other. Consequently, the fleet\u2019s reaction time would be even less than that.<br>", "<br>", "When it came, Njun was not even that surprised. \u201cIncoming ordnance!\u201d Sensors reported. \u201cSingle round detected.\u201d There was a brief hesitation as the officer attempted to divine the projectile\u2019s course. Njun curled his fingers into his palm. He had hoped the enemy\u2019s stores of this weapon would be depleted, but hope was a poor substitute for knowing. At least now he did. The only question now was which ship had been marked. It took agonizing second before the confirmation came in: \u201cWe\u2019ve been targeted.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "A guess, or had the enemy identified <i>Incendiary Determination</i> as the formation\u2019s command ship? They were very good singling out sigil vessels, but even from this distance? Njun leaned back in his throne, securing its restraints as he felt his starship prepare for evasive maneuvers. No organic helm crew could react fast enough; autonomic protocols had taken over. His ship was entirely in the hands of a machine as the main computer analyzed the course of the incoming projectile, began dispersing countermeasures and evaluating the best method of ensuring that <i>Incendiary Determination</i> survived the next few minutes.<br>", "<br>", "With barely any warning, the battleship\u2019s thrusters fired, hurling millions of tonnes of starship onto a new course as its computer tried to out-think the enemy. <i>Incendiary Determination</i>\u2019s inertial dampeners were red-lined as they struggled to negate the sudden increase in g-forces. Any crew not already secured in acceleration slings or braced against the sudden maneuver were thrown off their feet and anything not properly webbed down smashed against walls and decks, but the mass round sheared harmlessly past <i>Incendiary Determination</i>. Deprived of its prey, the weapon merely chose another. Faster than any organic mind or their tepid, chugging machine servants could think, the warhead\u2019s tracking systems locked onto a new target. Powerful thrusters flared, burning themselves out in heartbeats as they dramatically changed the weapon\u2019s course. Its new target had less than a second to react and the weapon detonated in extreme proximity to CSFWV <i>Nightbreaker</i>. The accompanying burst of energy temporarily blinded the formation\u2019s scopes, irradiating recon drones and defence platforms. As damaging to squadron cohesion as this was, it was only a secondary effect.<br>", "<br>", "Despite the relatively small percentage of energy from the blast that actually reached the battleship, the amount that <i>did</i> was sufficient to ensure that <i>Nightbreaker</i>\u2019s screens suffered immediate and total collapse. In the instant before its destruction, the first impactor broadcast a high-density data burst. Complete gibberish to anything but its intended recipient, it carried updated targeting instructions. If it were put into words that organic minds could comprehend, the message could be distilled to six words: <i>This one is injured. Kill it.</i><br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "\u201cSecond round detected,\u201d Sensors reported, her face drawn. \u201cIt\u2019s going after <i>Nightbreaker</i>.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Njun nodded. \u201cFormation to defence mode. Let\u2019s do what we can.\u201d He took a breath and slowly let it out. He considered himself an intelligent, rational man. He\u2019d never believed in any gods, but Fortune... the grand dame of chance played her games on every soul in the galaxy, atheist and believer alike. Watching a weapon that could render planets lifeless arc towards the wounded <i>Nightbreaker</i>, the Column Leader hoped quite fervently that luck would be kind... but in his experience hope was all too often wasted.<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "Targeting systems more powerful than those installed on any other weapon in known space had <i>Nightbreaker</i> locked in and refused to give it up, despite the sudden squall of jamming coming from the ship and its confederates. The Compact squadron shifted to a full defensive mode in an attempt to protect their weakened comrade, other battleships offering themselves as sacrifices and the sudden wall of ECM, defensive fire and interdicting warships required the warhead to adjust its course, missing the damaged battleship completely as its threaded its way between <i>Incendiary Determination</i> and <i>Unfailing Castigator</i>.<br>", "<br>", "Maneuvering thrusters fired, bringing the impactor around in a deceptively languid turn that would have blown out every inertial dampener on a ship its size and turned any organic crew members into a thin film on the bulkheads. The warhead\u2019s function system was only a shade below full sentience and it casually analyzed the blaring jamming fields of its enemy, sorting substance from signal. It saw its universe in indescribable colours and sensory data, listening to the harsh blue grinding of hostile ECM, licking at the slippery grittiness of gravitational disruptors, and brushing aside the flush and pulse of thermal bafflers. Some of the finest defences in the galaxy were at work, doing everything in their power to confuse and disrupt the impactor\u2019s acquisition of its target and they were beginning to win.<br>", "<br>", "The weapon\u2019s target lock wavered as it strained to hold onto its prey amongst the discordance, tightening its arc as it came about. It shivered as it passed through the wake of something it couldn\u2019t see, ignoring the sour flickers of blind-firing point defence lasers and the crackling hiss of counter-missile drives as they scorched by. It dismissed this threat; none of them were directly in its flight path and nor would they be able to come about to catch it. It shifted that fraction of its mind from threat-analysis to target acquisition.<br>", "<br>", "In less time than it took a thought to form, the warhead\u2019s intelligence reacquired its quarry. Secondary targets were dropped from analysis as it completed its turn. Overloaded with the demands placed upon them, the impactor\u2019s main drives were ruined: mangled, overheated, broken things that had died to give it its horrendous speed, but it managed to coax a little more thrust from its sputtering, failing thrusters. Not much, not at all. Perhaps not even enough to matter, reducing its final approach by microseconds, if that. Still, that it <i>might</i> matter was all the reason the weapon needed.<br>", "<br>", "It sheared through the drive wake of its foe, coming straight up the battleship\u2019s rear blind zone. The vessel had begun a last-ditch maneuver, hurling its four-kilometer bulk awkwardly to one side. It wouldn\u2019t change its position all that much, but just enough to deny the weapon a direct hit. Sometimes those few extra kilometers meant the difference between destruction and survival. Today was not one of those times and the Compact warship\u2019s final, desperate maneuvers mattered not one iota.<br>", "<br>", "With its last instant of life, the weapon\u2019s intelligence activated its payload. There was a pulse of light that rivalled any star, accompanied by an equally intense burst of radiation. Armour that could have weathered virtually any assault in the galaxy was instantly reduced to stripped atoms. In the span of a heartbeat, CSFWV <i>Nightbreaker</i> and the one hundred and seven thousand souls aboard it were reduced to a cloud of atomic vapour.<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "On the main holo tank, one of the battleship icons faded away. Seven red threat markers remained.<br>", "<br>", "Allyria growled in satisfaction. Grace bit her lip. The Verrish had grown up as a refugee on her own planet, old enough to remember what the Compact had done to Vara. She\u2019d only ever known the Compact as the enemy, the people that had destroyed everything and taken her from her family. Grace had never known just how much anger Allyria had kept hidden, how much of an effort it had been to smile and profess her loyalty to an organization she hated so deeply. To her, that disappearing icon was a victory.<br>", "<br>", "And it was \u2013 it was a greater chance, however slim that <i>Nemesis</i> would live. Grace knew that she couldn\u2019t overlook that. She didn\u2019t want Red One to die. The AI was the last link to Earth. Once she was gone, something beautiful would be lost... but no matter how hard she tried, how much she\u2019d come to resent and hate the Compact for everything that they\u2019d done, she also couldn\u2019t overlook the fact that one hundred thousand people had just died. That was equivalent to a small city on Rally. One hundred thousand mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, sons and daughters \u2013 gone, just like that. Her training, her duty, her upbringing \u2013 they all told her that she had to stop this. That she should have stopped it somehow. That this was wrong beyond imagining. Another part of her, the part that had seen what the Compact had done to Earth, didn\u2019t care. Didn\u2019t want it to stop.<br>", "<br>", "<i>Make them pay for it,</i> she\u2019d said minutes earlier. A month ago, she couldn\u2019t have imagined saying, couldn\u2019t have imagined wanting to see the Compact humiliated, their ships destroyed. She\u2019d changed. Sometimes she wondered if it was for the better, but every time she did she thought of Allyria. Of Vara and what she\u2019d seen on Earth, the buried remnants of a town. One of the last traces of the sixteen billion lives that died by fire. She thought of her own world. The security checkpoints that she\u2019d had to endure, the laughter of the Tribunes at the \u2018Broken\u2019. The uncivilized, barbaric, <i>stupid</i> humans who\u2019d destroyed their own world and nearly died out themselves until the Compact had come in and <i>saved</i> them. It was wrong. All of it. <i>We deserve to be free.</i><br>", "<br>", "Grace ran her tongue over her dry lips, looking at her comrades. Lydia\u2019s expression was cold, with a trace of Allyria\u2019s satisfaction. Marcus had no expression, but there was still that unhealthy gleam in his eyes. <i>This is us,</i> Grace realized. <i>This what we\u2019re going to have to work with.</i><br>", "<br>", "She took a breath, held it, then let it out. <i>Okay,</i> she said to herself. <i>We\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll do it. We\u2019ll make them remember us. We\u2019ll make them remember <i>her</i></i>.

It had been, by some twisted definition of the word, \u2018lucky\u2019. The enemy\u2019s mass round had detonated further from it than <i>Nightbreaker</i>. Still, what was left of <i>Requisite Persection</i> was less a ship and more a conglomeration of shattered metal and ashen organic matter. More than two hundred thousand people dead and they hadn\u2019t gotten close to the enemy\u2019s range yet. Still... it was rationing its fire, unlike in Zenthora when it had used those damn meteor cannons to rip the heart out of the defenders.<br>", "<br>", "His crew and <i>Incendiary Determination</i>\u2019s leader were looking to him, but he said nothing, waiting. Moments passed. No further launches came from the enemy. It was either out of mass rounds, or it was holding them in reserve for some unfathomable reason. The Column Leader tapped one finger against the arm of his throne. \u201cSet us to Case Orange Five,\u201d he ordered calmly.<br>", "<br>", "The formation would not break away, nor would they attempt a long-range duel with the enemy. They would close with and attempt to destroy it. If it ran, it would only end up deeper in the system\u2019s gravity well, a <i>daseen</i> cornered and killed by hounds \u2013 not that it appeared to be running. Whatever heathen minds commanded that vessel, they had chosen to stand against Rainbreaker Two rather than prolong their fight. Well, he would oblige them. Njun leaned back in his chair as his squadron continued to accelerate towards the enemy.<br>", "<br>", "<i>Onward.</i><br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "<i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s magazine stores were below critical levels. Even with so many of her launchers offline, Red One would burn through her remaining ordnance in this engagement. In a protracted battle, a Compact Chariot could always expect, if nothing else, to have more ammunition available to it than its human-built counterpart. Part of this was due to the difference in size between <i>Nemesis</i> and modern-era Compact dreadnoughts. A <i>Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment</i>-class Chariot was almost two kilometers longer than <i>Nemesis</i> and even the smallest classes of Compact Chariots had a mass advantage on Red One\u2019s ship-self.<br>", "<br>", "Additionally, despite the advantages that they conveyed in battle, the warship\u2019s hellebores and displacement engine took up a significant portion of <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s internal mass. Although the AI had increased the size of her magazines, she still carried less ordnance than even the smallest Chariot. In a normal situation, this would have mattered very little as the Confederacy\u2019s deep space fleet engagement vessels had been envisioned as operating close to resupply lines \u2013 there hadn\u2019t been that much territory left in the Confederacy anyways. Despite all the modifications she had performed on herself, Red One remained fundamentally an assassin, built to cause as much damage as possible within the shortest amount of time and then withdraw. Compact warships were brawlers, and intended to operate for as long as possible without resupply.<br>", "<br>", "This meant that if any Compact Chariot survived against \u2018the Wound\u2019 long enough, they could expect their enemy to deplete its ordnance before them. The destruction of Security Force Bavok and the subsequent running battle with Execution Force Renan in Zenthora depleted <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s missile stocks to critical levels. The engagement with the Veiled Archers had reduced them further.<br>", "<br>", "If the dreadnaught survived the engagement with Rainbreaker Two, its ranged armament would be almost utterly depleted.<br>", "<br>", "However, Red One knew how to get a lot out of a little and as one of the final salvos she had left to her was loaded and prepped for launch, she felt a trickle of satisfaction.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cDriver one loaded.\u201d It was a purr. \u201cDriver one firing.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "The Confederacy had no name for them. They had only been a theory, a possibility with nothing behind it. Red One had taken that theory and made it real, one of the handful of true horrors in her arsenal. They were expensive and time-consuming to produce, even more so then the \u2018warp\u2019 missiles that she had devised. Dangerously unstable even when inactive, the ship dared not carry more than a handful of breachers at any time. Upon her current deployment, she had only carried the one. Never used in Zenthora, it had been among the five remaining charges awaiting launch. Now, it was the last impactor in her stores.<br>", "<br>", "It pulsed from <i>Nemesis</i>, accelerating towards the enemy fleet as fast as the rest of its kin, but its intention was not to strike any of the remaining ships. Once active, its warhead was far too unstable to be a reliable weapon. It was intended not to attack the enemy directly, but to rip open their defences.<br>", "<br>", "Many nations had experimented with the development of shift systems as weaponry, but it was too dangerous to reliably use. The most common extension of this school of thought was the deployment of kamikazes to form warp points within enemy formations. Very few of these attempts had ever progressed beyond the planning stage. The first and most obvious issue was the cost: the shift system was the most advanced, most complicated and expensive part of a starship. For relatively little additional expense, you could build a multi-use warship instead of a one-use suicider. Adding sufficient defences to the vessel to ensure it survived to reach its target only increased the cost further from a cheap, expendable weapon. Another practical concern was that shift systems has massive energy demands. Their activation could not be missed by any attentive officer... the same activation which would strip power from the kamikaze\u2019s defences, engines and ECM, making it extremely easy to disable, destroy or avoid altogether.<br>", "<br>", "Proximity was another issue. Starships formed warp points as close to themselves as possible; it was much harder to sustain a warp point any real distance from oneself, meaning that any suicide attack must all but directly strike its target. The final issue was related to the nature of warp points themselves. They were notoriously fickle things; too much stress from the gravity well of a star hundreds of millions of kilometers distant was itself enough to collapse them, but it wasn\u2019t only gravity that adversely affected them. Intense electromagnetic energy \u2013 such as found in void combat \u2013 could do it as well. In an area filled with weapons fire, the warp point might very well not form at all, making the effort of creating a purpose-built kamikaze pointless. Still, despite the myriad issues of safely using warp weaponry, there were those who continued to attempt the research. Their results tended to range from \u2018disappointing\u2019 to \u2018catastrophic\u2019.<br>", "<br>", "But then none of those men, women and other-gendered beings had had an AI. Red liked to dabble in the field; it had led her to develop her \u2018warp\u2019 missiles, though these were not, strictly speaking, weapons. The warhead she used now, a \u2018breacher\u2019 was still a work in progress, but it was a line of thought that had gone from theoretical to practical. Red\u2019s solution turned out to be rather straightforward, based on her own primary reactor. Create a stripped-down version of said reactor to create a contained breach, place it inside an impactor and then cause a deliberate containment failure.<br>", "<br>", "That was simple enough, but moving from concept to execution had required both a certain degree of creativity and a significant amount of trial and error that had on at least one instance, substantially altered the basic shape of a small moon. Furthermore, construction of a breacher was a considerable investment in resources; what Red One spent on crafting a single one of these weapons could be used towards producing multiple more conventional, weapons with little loss in overall destructiveness. The weapons were also dangerously unstable once activated; several times during development (and once in direct combat) the containment fields collapsed early and the weapon destroyed itself far short of its target, causing more problems for Red One than her enemy.<br>", "<br>", "In short, the weapons were difficult to use, required material cost out of proportion to their effect in combat and were dangerous to her. The benefit to their deployment was that the Compact still had no conclusive proof that she had them and thus could not anticipate them. Consequently, the results were devastating.<br>", "<br>", "The breacher detonated in the midst of Rainbreaker Two. There was no explosion, no conflagration. Instead, the makeshift breach core built into the weapon was set loose and reality broke apart. The breach itself was no bigger than a child\u2019s fist and its violence was only a shadow of what <i>Nemesis</i> reactor would look like if it ever lost containment, but for the handful of instants it existed, it spasmed and thrashed madly. It was not the ordered, streamlined chaos of a true warp point with a fractured, ragged periphery; as Faithful Trenis had thought weeks earlier, this breach was all edge and it was twisting itself and nearby space into insane, impossible geometries as it vomited out intense, erratic waves of energy.<br>", "<br>", "The ships of Rainbreaker Two clawed for distance from the breach, as it lashed them with tendrils of energy and bled gravitic distortions that tugged and pulled at them, but for all that, it was mostly sound and fury. Their own shift systems automatically began to bleed off the energy and any damage was minimal. If it had struck a starship, that starship would have died, but what was the point of killing just one more ship?<br>", "<br>", "What it did was far worse.<br>", "<br>", "Cloaking systems were a delicate network of several technologies, able to shroud a ship from all but the most intense sensor sweeps, up to concealing it from visual detection. There was a trade-off. A fully shrouded vessel was almost blind to the outside world. It could not make rapid maneuvers, could not use active sensors, accelerate rapidly \u2013 spend too much energy too quickly and its shroud would be useless..<br>", "<br>", "The stealth fields concealing the seven destroyers of the Oilflame Murderers were finely-tuned, able to compensate for the distortions in the battleships\u2019 drive wake and almost any unexpected events. The detonation of the breach charge was not one of these. The snarls and surges of electromagnetic and gravitic energy were more intense than any explosion. Scopes were burnt out, reconnaissance platforms malfunctioned and failed, delicate webs of ECM were shredded as the warp breach spasmed and finally collapsed back in on itself. For several seconds, everyone believed that this was some failed superweapon... and then someone noticed the gaping holes in the formation\u2019s missile defence coverage and that the dreadnaught\u2019s missiles were now headed right for those openings.<br>", "<br>", "It took only a second or two longer to notice that the delicate balance of systems that provided such excellent stealth to the destroyers was no longer functioning as it should. The energy that they had absorbed from the breach \u2013 much of it had been harmless. Sound and fury, and their shrouds had adapted automatically. There had been flickers \u2013 none longer than a second or two and most measured in fractions of that \u2013 as their stealth fields had failed. In some circumstances that would have been enough to betray them, but the additional protection from the battleships\u2019 wake helped conceal these lapses.<br>", "<br>", "The extradimensional energy that had boiled out of that small tear... <i>that</i> was what killed them. The crews of the Oilflame Murderers were very good and they compensated as quickly as they could, but silhouetted against the breach and with their struggling stealth fields catching them like dancers in a strobe light, the warships appeared and disappeared for infinitesimal moments as their shrouds struggled and failed to keep them concealed. Their ECM coverage was ruined and against raw shockspace energy, the delicate tuning and auto-correcting of the shrouds was no longer working perfectly. Any other enemy would have been unable to capitalize on this weakness. The range was too long, the lapses in their shrouds far too brief-<br>", "<br>", "\u2013 but this was what Red One had been looking for, what she\u2019d known would happen. Her breachers weren\u2019t anti-ship weapons, but like a battering ram against a castle\u2019s gates, they opened a hole in the enemy\u2019s defences for her \u2018soldiers\u2019. In this case, the missile salvo boring down on the battleships. The salvo the Compact officers, gunners and tactical systems had known were targeting them and only them. Sensor data trickled in from hidden recon drones, pre-programmed imperatives flickered through cybernetic minds and the missiles obeyed, pulling themselves onto new courses.<br>", "<br>", "The formation noticed, of course. The battleships were shielded, protected by defences that would laugh at the assaults of entire fleets and were protecting each other, defensive missiles and point-defence fire criss-crossing the void as they struggled to intercept the salvo, but they\u2019d lost too many layers of protection. Too many of their sensor platforms were either destroyed or useless, too many of their ECM platforms had been burnt out by the previous mass rounds, too much of their own systems were still half-blind from the breach. They did all they could, but it was not enough.<br>", "<br>", "The destroyers were running on low-power mode, their reactors at minimum and most of that energy fed into their shrouds. They had no defence. Several of them attempted to come to combat stations, but it took time to react. To pass orders, to shut down the network of cloaking systems and restore screens, fire control and point defences. The destroyers\u2019 crews reacted faster than anyone could have expected, but like their comrades on the battleships, they didn\u2019t have the time.<br>", "<br>", "The missiles were dancing, threading their way through the fleet\u2019s counter-fire and flashing through blind zones. Some of them detonated prematurely, disorienting the fire-control sensors targeting their comrades. Others veered into swarms of counter missile before exploding, sacrificing themselves as still others abruptly switched targets to the battleships themselves, forcing cursing gunnery officers to decide between protecting themselves and engaging the missiles heading towards the Oilflame Murderers. Many from <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s salvo were stopped, but not enough to make a difference. Not nearly enough.<br>", "<br>", "Not a single one of the destroyers was able to provide any meaningful defence and all seven of them were wiped away, like toys swept from a tabletop.<br>", "<br>", "Aboard <i>Incendiary Determination</i>, Column Leader Njun sucked in a breath, biting back a peal of curses. He\u2019d <i>known</i> the destroyers were there and his ships had been barely able to detect them. How...?<br>", "<br>", "He gave himself a mental shake. More missiles were incoming, targeted to his battleships. The salvo density was light, lighter than that the Veiled Archers had faced. It <i>was</i> running out of ammunition. This thing was nearly dead. The Tribune dug his fingernails into his palm. \u201cOnward,\u201d he said under his breath, his eyes lifted to the ugly orange icon on the holo tank.<br>", "<br>", "<i>Onward.</i><br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "The battleships were firing back in earnest, pouring every missile they had towards <i>Nemesis</i>. She\u2019d battered another one of them into a hulk and a second was showing increasing signs of battle damage, but she was in their range now. Her ECM was still superior and her point defence grid, though heavily damaged, was more efficient. They wouldn\u2019t be able to kill her with missiles alone and the enemy commander would know that. Whether he was a glory hound looking for the victory himself, or simply someone trying to do as much as possible didn\u2019t matter. In a few moments, his ships would be irrevocably committed to an energy duel with her. They\u2019d shoot past each other in a matter of seconds, but the enemy would execute high energy turns to attempt to get into her aft blind zone at which point they would attempt to stay inside her turns.<br>", "<br>", "He still had time to break off, so she\u2019d keep encouraging that boldness. She deliberately threw a stutter into her power grid, making sure that the enemy saw it through her jamming. <i>Come on,</i> the warship hissed. <i>Come and kill me.</i><br>", "<br>", "As she did this, Red One\u2019s avatar clasped her hands behind her back. It was time. She looked over, catching Grace\u2019s eye. When the young officer glanced back at her, the ship spoke. \u201cWhen the stars threw down their spears, and watered Heaven with their tears, did he smile his work to see?\u201d Allyria turned to look, confused. Grace bit her lip then nodded. \u201cYes,\u201d she said.<br>", "<br>", "Red One tilted her head in gratitude. She looked to Allyria next. \u201cYou were right before. Thank you.\u201d To Lydia: \u201cRemember what they\u2019ve done.\u201d Marcus: \u201cI\u2019ve provided you the information you asked for.\u201d A sad smile played across the hologram\u2019s lips. <i>My crew.</i> \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to go,\u201d she said without further preamble. \u201cYour ship has been given coordinates to the Grasp. You\u2019ll find someone there who will help you.\u201d She nodded at the glint in Marcus\u2019s eyes, confirming the young man\u2019s thoughts.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cWait-\u201d Grace spoke up first, but Allyria was behind her by less than a fraction of a heartbeat.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cNo-\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cWe-\u201d Lydia.<br>", "<br>", "Whatever else the three of them might have wanted to say was lost in the sound of a warning klaxon and the sound of air being pulled from command. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to go,\u201d the starship repeated one last time as her four surviving crew fled from the bridge. She locked the doors behind them, waiting a moment before evacuating the air from the corridor outside, forcing the four towards her hangar, closing blast doors and sealing off any route that didn\u2019t lead them out. There\u2019d be no long goodbyes, no arguments, no last stands, no misplaced defiance. They lived. That was all that mattered.<br>", "<br>", "Two thousand years and she traded her life for four short-lived organics. She wondered what her \u2018sister\u2019 would have made of that.<br>", "<br>", "Devoting a portion of her mind to ensuring that they did make it to their ship, the AI shut off her avatar and turned the rest of her attention back to the matter at hand. She didn\u2019t feel pain \u2013 not as an organic mind would understand it, but in simple parlance... this was going to hurt. Still, as the enemy squadron reached the point of no return, somewhere deep in the endless kilometers of circuitry of her mind, Red One smiled.<br>", "<br>", "<i>Both of us burn.</i><br>", "<br>", "As it should be.<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "<i>Nemesis</i> was dying.<br>", "<br>", "The damaged inertial dampeners weren\u2019t up to the task of hiding each blow and Grace could feel the vibrations as <i>Nemesis</i> took hit after hit even through everything the crippled warship could throw at her enemy. The shields were flickering on and off, staying up just long enough to be knocked back down, but some missiles were slipping through. More and more of them, in fact. The lights were dimming and shutting off entirely as power was disrupted. At first, that was the only sign of the damage <i>Nemesis</i> was taking, but as they got closer to the hangar and the outer decks, it became more and more apparent. Each blow felt harder with less time between them.<br>", "<br>", "As they passed each blast door, it slammed shut, cutting off their retreat until they were at the hangar and the courier Red had provided for them. Marcus was first up the ramp. Lydia was next. Neither of them slowed down.<br>", "<br>", "Allyria halted in her tracks. She bit her lip, looking around the boat bay. Her tintas hung limply down her back and she was holding her pendant. Grace stopped in front of her. \u201cWe have to go,\u201d the human said softly.<br>", "<br>", "The Verrish nodded, but she didn\u2019t move. \u201cOur Angel,\u201d she said. There were tears in her eyes. Grace had only seen the other girl cry a handful of times before. \u201cOur Angel,\u201d she repeated softly. The young girl took her lover\u2019s hand again. <i>Nemesis</i> had been Allyria\u2019s dream. The one thing she knew that the Compact was afraid of. The one thing that might one day free Vara from its enslavement and she was dying. Allyria took a step back and Grace felt her heart jump into her mouth. <i>You can\u2019t stay here!</i> she wanted to scream. <i>She\u2019s </i>dying<i>. She\u2019s going to die. We </i>can\u2019t<i> stay.</i><br>", "<br>", "\u201cIt isn\u2019t over,\u201d Grace said softly, reaching up and lifting Allyria\u2019s chin, looking into the taller girl\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt isn\u2019t. I promise.\u201d Her tone was soft, but there was an undercurrent of iron in her words. \u201cI promise. We\u2019ll remember. We will.\u201d Her voice caught in her throat. \u201cWe\u2019ll make them remember. <i>We\u2019ll</i> make them pay for it. For our Angel.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Allyria\u2019s eyes flashed at that and she nodded, boarding the courier. Lydia and Marcus were already in the cockpit. As the airlock door sealed down behind her, the Verrish\u2019s last sight of <i>Nemesis</i> was of the lights in the hangar going out. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to stay,\u201d she said, still staring at the door. \u201cNot really. She wouldn\u2019t have let me.\u201d The courier shivered as it lifted off.<br>", "<br>", "\u201c<i>I</i> wouldn\u2019t have let you,\u201d Grace told her, trying to keep the tremor out of her voice. \u201cI would have knocked you out and carried you on board. Don\u2019t think I wouldn\u2019t. I put you on your ass that day in the gym.\u201d She steadied herself. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lose you again. Not ever.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Allyria nodded, but she still didn\u2019t look away. One tinta twitched. \u201cYou said we\u2019d make them remember.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cYes.\u201d Grace ran the back of her hand along Allyria\u2019s forearm. \u201cAlways.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "Njun grinned viciously as another salvo went home, striking the enemy hard. Even through its still damnably effective jamming, he could tell that it was suffering. Its power grid was unstable, its point defences were degrading and fewer and fewer missiles were coming back from it as its magazines ran dry and launch tubes were destroyed. The Execution Force had hurt it worse than expected, but it was still coming for them.<br>", "<br>", "That was fine; it meant his ships were coming for <i>it</i>, too.<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "The pinnace shot out of <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s hangar, banking hard and putting itself on a course away from the battleships that were still closing in. The courier had no defences outside of its stealth field and it would not be able to bring that up fully until it was well clear of the dreadnaught.<br>", "<br>", "All four defectors were squeezed into the small craft\u2019s cramped, makeshift cockpit, watching as Red One stood her ground, firing back at her tormentors with everything she had. Allyria was crying, not even making any effort to hide it as she watched <i>Nemesis</i> die. Lydia was stone-faced, rasping the date into her vambrace. Even Marcus was silent, his smirk nowhere to be seen.<br>", "<br>", "Just as with the Veiled Archers, The Writ said that eight battleships had no chance of taking on a fully operational titan-grade warship. Not unless the odds were in their favour. Unfortunately, <i>Nemesis</i> was <i>not</i> fully operational and the odds... the odds were very much slanted towards the Compact, but even as close to death as she was, <i>Nemesis</i> was still a dreadnaught. She\u2019d already taken enough damage to wipe away entire formations of lesser ships and was punishing the battleships relentlessly. She\u2019d killed two with her hellebores. She\u2019d spotted and neutralized the formation\u2019s destroyers and even through their defences, she\u2019d killed another battleship with missiles and inflicted damage on all the others. Attack drones rolled and looped through interlacing fields of fire, striking at weakened screens, missiles darted to and fro with a maneuverability and responsiveness that made it seem like they were dancing.<br>", "<br>", "Until now, if the Compact forces had noticed the courier\u2019s launch \u2013 not a sure thing, but not impossible either \u2013 it would have been a trivial matter to detail a recon platform to track them even through their shroud. Marcus and Lydia had asked why they would bother, but Grace had answered that question: <i>the ship they\u2019ve spent two thousand years trying to destroy has, on the eve of its destruction, launched a </i>courier<i>. You don\u2019t think that will make them curious?</i> With the battleships fully engaged, their attention was divided. Now, if they noticed the courier at all, it would be assumed to be another ECM or sensor platform. Their fire control would flag it as a low threat and their gunners would ignore it in favour of the missiles flaying them and the attack drones cutting into their ships.<br>", "<br>", "Once the entire fleet arrived, the possibility of the courier escaping dropped drastically. More than a hundred and fifty ships? Someone would have noticed the launch and they certainly would identify the courier\u2019s true nature. They would have wondered and they would have intercepted it, but the five remaining battleships of this squadron couldn\u2019t spare the attention.<br>", "<br>", "<i>\u201cMy chance of survival does not appreciably change,\u201d the AI had said again, just as calm as the first time, \u201cno matter how long I defer battle. Yours does. Once they decide to move in force, the odds of them detecting the courier increase substantially. I choose not to give them that time. I choose not to run. I want to die fighting, not run to ground. As a soldier, not a victim.\u201d</i><br>", "<br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d Grace said softly, ignoring the curious looks the others gave her. She could feel wetness on her own cheeks now, but she was smiling. <i>We smiled our work to see.</i><br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "<i>Nemesis</i> sacrificed forward firepower for her six hellebores and the displacement engine, but what few prow weapons she had were comparatively heavier and more destructive than many of her broadside weapons. The dreadnaught fired first. Her prow missile tubes were run dry, but twenty-seven of her thirty-six prow energy emplacements remained operational and went to continuous rapid fire. The first target was <i>Nurtured Grievance</i>. It took two seconds for the beams to cross the distance between the ships. Another two point six seconds after <i>Nemesis</i> fired, <i>Nurtured Grievance</i>\u2019s prow exploded as a particle beam intended to cut through a Chariot\u2019s screens penetrated several layers of composite armour and ignited a magazine. Four point seven seconds after Red One fired, the battleship was no longer operational as <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s beams cored nearly four kilometers of warship like a rotten apple. The four remaining battleships went to rapid fire on all forward-facing railguns and missile tubes as they moved to avoid her prow weapons, positioning themselves sweep across her flanks.<br>", "<br>", "Armour plating crackled, fragmented, buckled and shattered as the dreadnaught was hit again and again and still she fought on. <i>Unrelenting Warhammer</i> went dark for an instant as the battleship\u2019s primary power failed and its overtaxed secondary reactors and auxiliary power sources attempted to handle the strain of full combat operations. Its output of fire diminished significantly and several large gaps opened in its defence grid. <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s remaining attack drones immediately focused their assault on the stricken battleship, destroying its heaviest weapons emplacements and further eroding its defensive capability before power could be fully restored. Although its comrades attempted to render aid, <i>Unrelenting Warhammer</i> was unable to protect itself and <i>Nemesis</i> pounded it into ruin. Spewing escape pods like pollen, the stricken battleship no longer posed any threat.<br>", "<br>", "Two ships lost in a matter of seconds, but by now the distance between Compact and Confederate vessels was within three hundred thousand kilometers. The three remaining warships of Rainbreaker Two had reached their own energy range.<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "The monster shuddered and bled its own atomized hull into space as <i>Incendiary Determination</i>, <i>Severing Blow</i> and <i>Merciful Fate</i> tore into it, firing nonstop. At their own speed and that of the hostile, they would only have a handful of seconds before both sides blew past each other. Though they were battleships, Njun\u2019s vessels were smaller and more maneuverable than the beast. They would execute high energy turns and get inside the enemy. The destroyers should have done this \u2013 or at least delivered the final blow with their disruptors \u2013 but needs must. <i>Incendiary Determination</i> and <i>Severing Blow</i> would pass it on its starboard side \u2013 <i>Merciful Fate</i> would take the left. The former was still hurting from the missile barrage and it needed the cover <i>Incendiary Determination</i> would provide.<br>", "<br>", "<i>Merciful Fate</i>\u2019s status indicator flashed urgently as the vessel took several penetrating hits in quick succession, but the battleship remained operational. <i>Severing Blow</i> suffered a catastrophic screen failure as its overtaxed defences collapsed. With only the briefest pause, the enemy dreadnaught\u2019s plasma cannons opened fire, the hideous weapons pounding the battleship\u2019s starboard flank into ruin, but it rolled to present an undamaged side to the enemy and kept firing.<br>", "<br>", "All his ships were under cyber attacks, but either the damage to the enemy or the safeguards they were operating under were preventing it from getting a foothold. Several drones had spiralled in on suicide courses and he\u2019d lost more than a few missiles to the animal, but it would not be taking his ships from him today. The beast was damaged to the point of crippling as the two battleships raked its starboard broadsides to ruin, Merciful Fate laying into the injured monster\u2019s other flank. How many of its crew died in those instants, Njun couldn\u2019t have said. Not enough. Not nearly enough to pay it back.<br>", "<br>", "He didn\u2019t even notice when <i>Severing Blow</i> died. It was a matter of instants. Once moment it was there alongside <i>Incendiary Determination</i> and the next, it was gone, its aft third shattered, the force of the explosion hurling what was left of it wildly off course... and then they were past, safe in the enemy\u2019s blind zone. Two ships. He had two ships left. He\u2019d started with fifteen, but two was more than he needed now. Unless it could bring its prow guns back around, it didn\u2019t have enough firepower to stop him now. Even if it did, it would still die.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cBring us about,\u201d Njun growled softly, his voice rough as he stared at the enemy\u2019s marker. \u201cKill it.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "<i>Yasmine was fond of classical literature. On one occasion, she told me that it was simply so she\u2019d know \u2018what the Hell\u2019 Commander Sansbury was talking about with his predilection for cliches and eclectic aphorisms.

I am not done.<br>", "<br>", "Not yet.</i><br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "Njun braced himself in his throne as his ships heaved themselves about. He watched as the enemy, damaged but somehow still clinging to life, did the same. Even so badly hurt, it was turning faster than his ships, seeking to bring its prow weaponry back to him.

The Bastion Leader had not been authorized for the deployment of a Chariot, but thirty-five of his capital ships were battleships.

The aftermath of that battle would, I think, have prompted him to comment on the fable of the Bear and the Bees.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>The last message from Execution Force Hrunmer confirmed both their successful shock into Sol and my presence. I ensured that no further messages were sent. After two weeks of silence, an investigatory fleet was dispatched. I had quit the system some time ago, but I know they found almost no trace of Hrunmer or his command. There was just enough debris to identify several ships from his fleet, but no more than that. Intellectually, the conclusion is obvious: Hrunmer\u2019s fleet was lost with all hands and the hulks were stripped down for parts and then disposed of. Emotionally, a missing ship is worse than a wreck. You can </i>know<i> what happened to a hulk. When a vessel just vanishes, you have to </i>wonder<i>.

Call it an anniversary present. A string of civilian communication satellites that I\u2019d collected in my travels, at least one per planet. I set them to broadcast loops of the comm traffic that I intercepted from Execution Force Hrunmer. The outer system satellites transmitted the fleet\u2019s initial status reports and combat orders. As you moved in-system, the broadcasts devolve into distress calls and the static squeals of terminated datalinks. The final echelon of satellites carried my own personal song \u2013 the choir of all those I\u2019ve killed.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>I took time and care in arranging this bit of show, but I was never aiming to be subtle. I wanted my message to be obvious. That I had not forgotten what happened, and they are not welcome here.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>The Compact has not yet decided to heed the second part of my message.

Its pre-programmed directives were simple: immediately upon detection of the target, it was to shock to the nearest Fleet base of sufficient size, one capable of launching a force large enough to threaten the target. For its entire operational lifespan, that had been Nikem.<br>", " <br>", "Other drones had different missions; some were to shock to nearby developed colonies so that their data could be downloaded and archived. The worlds these couriers visited never knew what information they were hoarding. Their data analysts had learned to curb their curiousity when it came to missives from Sol. The more educated of these technicians believed the information tracked the movements of Naiads and other things within the Vault whose existence was officially denied. A few of the more daring men and women would whisper the word \u2018Gravestone\u2019 to each other, without fully understanding what it meant, filling in the gaps in their knowledge with rumour, suspicion and wild conjecture. That was fine; they were only meant to keep the records, not understand them. That was for the flag officers who would receive the other drones, those programmed to deliver that information to the highest-security Space Force facilities themselves.<br>", " <br>", "This drone was a herald, bearing a call to arms. It had had two siblings that shared its duty, but neither of them had arrived with it. The courier\u2019s simple computer system neither noticed their absence nor would it have cared if it had. Its own shock drive was burned out from the trip here, but the damage was inconsequential. Simple sensors and analysis software went to work identifying the star patterns and planets. It had arrived at its target.<br>", " <br>", "Radio antennae and receptor dishes unfurled as the craft tasted the comm traffic, confirming the presence of Compact forces here.<br>", " <br>", "Orienting itself towards the inner system, the robotic craft fired its thrusters and began to broadcast its first and only transmission, the security codes embedded in the data stream compelling its immediate recovery.<br>", " <br>", "The directives hard-coded into the drone\u2019s databanks superseded all but the highest authorities. Any other orders that local flag officers were operating under were immediately rescinded; they were to move on Sol in force without delay. The drone\u2019s archives contained the minimum information necessary to brief those officers on their way to the target. No time could be wasted; the window of opportunity was miniscule. In fact, it might have already closed. Given the Wound\u2019s past actions, it probably already had. That, however, was irrelevant.<br>", " <br>", "Over the centuries, Nikem had launched seven such missions in response to these summons, including Execution Force Hrunmer, although none of the others had done much more than arrive in Sol, sweep an empty system for traces of the target \u2018Gravestone\u2019 and return to Nikem in bewilderment and irritation. The system\u2019s governors and military commanders had stopped questioning the infrequent sojourns long ago, some hoping their unquestioning loyalty to these ancient directives would see the Triarchs\u2019 favour returned to their system.<br>", " <br>", "Today, the drone\u2019s message was received not only by the Nikem authorities, but by <i>Redemption of Sol</i> and its armada.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Warships didn\u2019t have much need for windows. They were structural weaknesses and with imagery from the sensors able to be transmitted to any screen on the ship, virtually every room on <i>Nemesis</i> had a \u2018window\u2019. Still, the vessel had been built with some thought for the psychological comfort of its crew and the dreadnaught had, at one point, boasted more than a handful of actual windows. Most of them had been replaced with solid armour during the warship\u2019s millennia-long campaign, the recreational decks and chambers that had once hosted panoramic views into space refurbished into fire-control stations, point defence silos, additional weapons mounts, thruster banks or anything else Red One could use. Still, she retained a few small sections that allowed for a passenger to directly look into space.<br>", " <br>", "The AI didn\u2019t need windows to see. Her sensors gave her so much information that a human mind would have been destroyed trying to process it all. Sitting in what had to be some kind of conference room, an exhausted Grace looked out the windows and wondered just how the starship interpreted what was happening out there. Was it just data to be sorted by algorithms and difference engines, or did the intelligence actually have senses like an organic did? Did she feel the winds buffeting her body, taste the hydrogen and helium clouds around her, smell the chemical composition of the atmosphere in which she lurked? Grace didn\u2019t know.<br>", " <br>", "There was a bright flash that lit the conference room as a jagged fork of electricity 200 kilometers long snaked through the clouds. Winds that made Rally\u2019s most terrifying gales seem like trivial nuisances stirred Jupiter\u2019s clouds, but <i>Nemesis</i> was unaffected by their fury. The dreadnaught had sunk into the gas giant\u2019s atmosphere upon the realization that her shift drive was damaged more than her initial assessments had indicated. It was deeper in the system then the other gas giants, but unlike the other gas giants, Jupiter was a failed star. The storms that formed, died and formed again throughout its atmosphere hid the evidence of the ship\u2019s drive, just as the planet\u2019s intense magnetic field and the radiation and heat that poured from its core obscured the dreadnaught\u2019s presence from all but the most dedicated scope sweeps.<br>", " <br>", "What had been only a delay of several days \u2013 close, but within the margins to escape before the Compact arrived \u2013 was now a matter of weeks. It would have been months, but Red One was nothing if not resourceful. Anchored within the calmer regions of the gas giant\u2019s Northern pole, so deep within the clouds that it couldn\u2019t be seen, was a cache of supplies. Grace wondered how many of these Red had hidden away throughout the Kaedan Vault \u2013 throughout all of the Compact, even.<br>", " <br>", "The ship hadn\u2019t wanted to plunder these stores \u2013 it was harder to conceal the movement of this much material in than it was to clear it out, but she had no choice. Raw materials, spare parts and munitions \u2013 even the platform itself \u2013 had been harvested in the hope that Red One could repair her ship-self in time, or fight her way past the hunters that were going to come for her.<br>", " <br>", "Grace was sitting on the table, still watching the drifting clouds, her arms around her knees. She\u2019d been helping where she could, but as she\u2019d lamented more than once during the salvage operation \u2013 it felt like a lifetime ago, not days \u2013 she wasn\u2019t an engineer like Alan and certainly not a soldier like the others. She\u2019d assisted in moving some of the supplies off the platform for what little help that was, but she wasn\u2019t as fast or efficient as Red\u2019s drones. She\u2019d been doing odd jobs wherever she could, but she felt like a fifth wheel. All of them had some way to contribute except her. She felt useless. What did a living ship need with a command-track officer?<br>", " <br>", "Maybe she could find something else. The Compact had always determined the positions of its officers and enlisted, giving them a sample of everything before finally deciding on the field in which they would be best suited to serve. She hadn\u2019t been the teachers\u2019 favourite pupil, but she liked to think she had potential. Maybe she could find a way to explore it herself now.<br>", " <br>", "Assuming that she even survived past the next week.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Echo\u2019s thoughts were racing more than usual. The arrival of the courier had put <i>Redemption of Sol</i>\u2019s command staff into a frenzy. The entire task force, already rushing to get back into space, was now straining to get their damage made good as fast as possible. As soon as the drone\u2019s message had been received, all non-essential work on any vessel that wasn\u2019t part of Execution Force Renan had been aborted to free up work crews for the Bastion Leader\u2019s armada. By the look of things, the demands on Nikem\u2019s yard crews were only going to get worse.<br>", " <br>", "The woman was with the rest of the Chariot\u2019s most senior officers, gathered in the opulent conference room off <i>Redemption of Sol</i>\u2019s main command deck.<br>", " <br>", "She hated this room. Hand-woven tapestries hung from the walls, detailing the victories of each iteration of <i>Redemption of Sol</i>, beginning with the original <i>Absolute Benediction of Justice</i>-class dreadnaught that had borne this name. Engravings featuring the greatest accomplishments of each vessel covered what bulkhead space was not concealed beneath self-congratulatory banners. Small trees sat in alcoves, needlessly expensive and rare varieties whose only purpose was ostensibly to create a more natural, soothing environment within the room, but whose true function was to showcase more of the ship\u2019s grandeur and the affluence of its creators. A Chariot was not <i>just</i> a warship, after all. It was certainly that: a fleet-killer who could topple empires all on its own, but it was also a symbol of the Compact\u2019s power and the chosen conveyances of its rulers on the few occasions that they deigned to walk amongst the rabble. No other nation could have afforded to build and operate so many dreadnaughts at once, let alone make them so luxurious.<br>", " <br>", "The name plaques of each <i>Redemption of Sol</i> \u2013 or replicates where the originals had been unrecoverable \u2013stood beside each of the silken battle honours and the carefully-pruned trees like headstones in a memorial garden. On each of those plaques had been carved same set of simultaneously self-effacing and self-aggrandizing commemoration.<br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cWe must bear witness. Not only for the living, but for the dead. We must stand against the darkness and say but two words.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "It was enough to bring the bile to the tip of her tongue.<br>", " <br>", "The woman shifted position in her too-large chair, the material altering itself to adjust to her posture. All around her, Renan\u2019s staff was arguing over their next course of action, but she seemed to have been forgotten for the moment. She didn\u2019t need to, but she picked up her \u2018scroll again, looking over the information on it. The data was irrefutable; the Wound had returned to Sol.<br>", " <br>", "This was bad. It was too soon; she wasn\u2019t ready. The others hadn\u2019t seen what she had, though \u2013 that was something. They thought that this fit her pattern. It didn\u2019t. Their quarry paid visits to Sol, but the Compact had long since determined that there was no rhyme or reason to the timing of these attacks. Decades or centuries could pass between its returns. That was why there was no fleet stationed there and only a handful of occasionally-useful listening posts.<br>", " <br>", "Echo didn\u2019t believe their theory. She suspected, but couldn\u2019t prove that there was a pattern in her quarry\u2019s visitations \u2013 a little bit of poetry in the long war. Ordinarily, Echo could appreciate that, but her current frustration left little room for admiration.<br>", " <br>", "<i>You went back to Earth. What were you </i>thinking<i>?!</i> <i>Nemesis</i> had hit the listening posts before, but never when she was this badly damaged. Why? What possible reason would she have-<br>", " <br>", "Echo paused, blinking as a flash of insight struck her. She <i>wouldn\u2019t have any reason to go there...</i>, the woman realized, still barely listening as her mind flashed with probabilities and potentialities, running calculations. She almost smiled. <i>...alone.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Oh, love. Really? What made you change your mind?</i> Well. Maybe she\u2019d find out. The woman looked over at the rest of the officers; the bickering was dying down. Most of the discussion had been about whether to leave now in the hopes of catching their target or to wait until the fleet was battle-ready, possibly sacrificing the opportunity in exchange for greater firepower. It was no surprise that Column Leader Uylk was leading the charge for the former. The fleet operations officer\u2019s opinions regarding client races (and humans in particular) hadn\u2019t changed one iota since Echo had been aboard the Chariot.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s wounded,\u201d Uylk was saying. The Tribune was pacing around the conference table. \u201cAn injured beast always returns to familiar ground.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOr it could be luring us into another trap,\u201d Strategist Emel\u2019iv pointed out calmly. The Thoughtful was sitting amidst a knot of his fellow strategists and intelligence analysts. \u201cHave you forgotten the Black Anniversary?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe hurt it,\u201d Uylk replied. \u201cBadly. What trap could it possibly spring?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI suspect that Bastion Leader Axem had similar thoughts before the Wound induced Vasul\u2019s star into an coronal mass ejection so violent that it overwhelmed a Chariot\u2019s screens,\u201d the Thoughtful observed mildly. \u201cOr perhaps Column Leader Prime Devon did as he \u2018tracked\u2019 the Wound directly into a Jackal ghost fleet.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Fleet Operations officer ground his teeth, but he nodded in recognition of Emel\u2019iv\u2019s point. Far too often a commander had \u2018known\u2019 the Wound was dying, crippled with its life ebbing away, only to have that surety vanish along with his command. Uylk stopped his pacing, leaning over the table to look at the assembled officers.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe have hurt it,\u201d he repeated. \u201cThe Wound had six weeks to arrange the Black Anniversary. Here,\u201d he tapped a single trimmed fingernail against the tabletop. \u201cIt has had only a matter of days. It expended most of its munitions fighting its way out of Zenthora. When we caught up to it in Al\u2019garesah, it didn\u2019t even try to fight. It ran. It\u2019s weak and alone. We <i>must</i> strike before it re-arms or before it escapes.\u201d He turned to Renan. The Bastion Leader was seated at the head of the table, a steaming cup of tea in front of him as he listened to his subordinates. \u201cIf it\u2019s still in Sol, then it\u2019s vulnerable. If we don\u2019t act, it will vanish for another hundred years.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThe overwhelming likelihood is that our target is already gone from the system,\u201d Renan said after a moment. \u201cOff to lick its wounds until it is ready to strike out again.

Are we headed into a trap, or simply wasting time?\u201d He lifted his cup and took a small sip.<br>", " <br>", "Right at that moment, Echo would rather have bitten off her tongue than respond \u2013 <i>It\u2019s too soon. I\u2019m not ready.</i> \u2013 but she twitched as the chains tightened in her mind, forcing her to answer. \u201cThe target is heavily damaged,\u201d she said carefully. \u201cIf she-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt,\u201d Renan corrected, setting his teacup back down.<br>", " <br>", "\u201c-if <i>it</i> had any industrial power to spare, <i>it</i> would have used it in Zenthora when <i>it</i> was fighting your Execution Force and Security Force Bavok.\u201d No one at the table other than Echo knew what had drawn the Wound to Zenthora, and she had been forbidden to reveal that information by the Triarch itself. The others assumed it had been hoping to catch the execution force at anchor and cripple it, but that wasn\u2019t quite true.<i>Nemesis</i> had learned what was going on in that system and... <i>she</i> had come to stop it, but like at Invida she\u2019d been too late. Execution Force Renan had already departed, leaving Column Leader Prime Bavok and his security force to bear the brunt of her assault.<br>", " <br>", "Bavok had had nothing heavier than battleships at his disposal, but he\u2019d managed to hold <i>Nemesis</i> in Zenthora long enough for Renan to return. Between the two of them, they had inflicted serious damage on the Wound, but not enough to prevent Bavok\u2019s command from being reduced to tatters. Rather than engage Renan\u2019s forces, <i>Nemesis</i> had fled, but the Compact force had been lucky enough to estimate where it had run: Al\u2019garesh, where it had quit the field again. That time, they hadn\u2019t been as fortunate.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cConsequently,\u201d Echo continued. \u201cThe chance of something like the Black Anniversary is remote.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Renan waited patiently, his fingers laced together. \u201cContinue,\u201d he ordered.<br>", " <br>", "The Broken\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cThere\u2019s an overwhelming chance <i>it</i> is still in Sol,\u201d she said.

I would rather miss an opportunity than risk entering a conflict to which I have cut off one of my hands before even starting. Nonetheless,\u201d he added. \u201cIf the emissary\u2019s evaluation is accurate, there will never be a better time for us to strike. Its combat capability is minimal and it cannot run.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Bastion Leader placed his hands on the table. \u201cWe will move on Sol.

Execution Force was headed out-system.<br>", " <br>", "Echo opened her eyes, flicking the drop of water away. Others replaced it. She had a choice to make.

If she was wrong and she acted, she would die. There\u2019d be no way to conceal it. It was not something that she could undo, either. Once she chose to let the program run at anything more than this glacial trickle, the traces it left in her mind would be obvious even to her minders.

The human murmured contentedly, but didn\u2019t move from where she lay, nestled against the larger girl. Before the Angel\u2019s arrival, Verrisha fables and legends had told of creatures like humans. Sprites and imps, mischievous or malicious with skin ranging from the colour of rust to that of cold highland mist. They had been <i>zhenra esh</i>... there was no direct translation in either Compact Standard, or English... the closest was \u2018mind-blind\u2019. It meant that they lacked the sensory awareness of Verrish tintas, but by the same measure, they were almost invisible to those same senses. They had played pranks upon, tormented and hunted Verrisha.<br>", " <br>", "When the records from the Angel had been examined, it had shocked Verrisha society. There had been theories abounding that \u2018hoomans\u2019 had visited their world before in secret \u2013 that was why the ship had come here, following some ancient star chart to a world it knew. Conspiracy theorists had gone wild, pointing to artefacts, artworks, stories and tales as \u2018proof\u2019 of these ancient visitations. Sadly, the truth, despite involving an alien warship contacting Vara and warning them about a vast all-consuming foe wasn\u2019t <i>quite</i> as sensational as aliens shaping Verrisha civilization over thousands of years. An accident of fate wasn\u2019t as interesting as a plan. It didn\u2019t mean anything, just simple random chance. Some people didn\u2019t like that \u2013 they wanted things to \u2018make sense\u2019. There had to be a plan, a reason, something that would make everything fit together. The truth was, there hadn\u2019t been. No, the truth wasn\u2019t always as glamorous as a good story.<br>", " <br>", "<i>But I still think I like it better,</i> the Verrish thought with a smile as she kissed Grace\u2019s shoulder. The human opened her eyes a slit, trying to muster a reproving glare. \u201cEasy,\u201d she said with a small smile.<br>", " <br>", "Both of them were bone-weary. Grace had been running herself nonstop, doing whatever she could wherever she could to help the ship and crew ready themselves for battle. Allyria had been training with Lydia and Marcus; Red One had produced a new suit of armour for the Verrish and had been working on the other former Janissaries\u2019 armour. Lydia had been adamant that she didn\u2019t want hers replaced \u2013 just improved. Marcus was less attached to his gear and had readily accepted the ship\u2019s new version.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Allyria replied coyly, running her fingers over Grace\u2019s arm again. \u201cI was just thinking...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace arched an eyebrow. \u201cAbout what?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAbout the past,\u201d the Verrish commented. \u201cHow it\u2019s never what we think it is. It\u2019s stories and rumours, hopes and lies all run together.\u201d She planted another small, chaste kiss on Grace\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI was thinking I like the truth.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSome people might not. Some of them might like those stories and lies,\u201d Grace said quietly.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI know,\u201d Allyria squeezed Grace\u2019s arm. \u201cDo you regret it?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cComing here? To a broken warship run by an artificial intelligence that\u2019s killed millions of Compact citizens, fighting a war that was lost two thousand years ago, knowing I can\u2019t go home again?\u201d Grace reached over her shoulder and took a hold of one of Allyria\u2019s head-tails, returning the Verrish\u2019s affections by kissing the tip softly. She let the tinta go and she smiled sadly. \u201cI do. Sometimes I wish I could be ignorant again, back on Rally. Training in the Academy, happy to serve and never knowing what us \u2018Broken\u2019 really are to them.\u201d Grace looked away. \u201cSometimes I wish for that...\u201d she closed her eyes, briefly then turned back to her lover. \u201cBut if someone offered me the chance to go back, I wouldn\u2019t take it. I don\u2019t want lies.\u201d She touched Allyria\u2019s face. \u201cI want what\u2019s real.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Allyria let out a growling purr, nuzzling the small woman.<br>", " <br>", "They slept in each other\u2019s arms for four hours and sixteen minutes before the alarm sounded.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAlert,\u201d Red One\u2019s voice broke the silence. \u201cMultiple warp points detected.

It was a useless, pointless emotion. Destructive to everyone and everything around it. Only the primitive, the savage, the <i>unenlightened</i> hated. Bigots too consumed by their own prejudices to just open their eyes, or people who just didn\u2019t know any better, afraid of anyone and anything different. Those were the kinds of people that hated. That was what she\u2019d been taught. She\u2019d always been baffled by how angry Allyria was at the Compact, how she could resent them so much. She\u2019d hadn\u2019t understood. Now, she did.<br>", " <br>", "Dead Earth crunched under her boots, her breath rasping in her ears. There was no wind; the only thing in the skies was one of <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s processing drones, the beetle-bodied craft kicking up a sandstorm with its VTOL engines, specially-modified grab fields adding to the storm as they pulsed through the dirt, sweeping away twenty centuries of time. Grace was standing on the lip of the excavation. Next to her was Lydia. The young woman had asked Red if she could come down here; Grace had volunteered to go with her. Marcus had turned down the offer and Alan had insisted that he\u2019d be \u2018too busy\u2019. Allyria had offered to come along as well; she was hanging back near the shuttle that had ferried them down here.<br>", " <br>", "It seemed like there should have been some wind, shouldn\u2019t it? Dead worlds always had wind stirring up dust and sand in the movies... but you needed an atmosphere for that. Grace knelt, picking up a handful of dirt. Trickles of particulate matter slipped through her gloves. This used to be something. A tree, a building... a person.<br>", " <br>", "A sudden wave of nausea hit the young woman with that realization. Sixteen billion people burned, reduced to vapour. These were their ashes. She was standing in the dead. With an effort, she held her gorge down. Grace raised her head, the searchlights on her helmet illuminating Lydia, the other girl back in her bulky power armour. She was standing on the lip of the crater, watching the excavation.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIs there anything left?\u201d Grace had asked after the record of Earth\u2019s destruction was over. \u201cDid they destroy everything?\u201d <i>Did they leave </i>anything<i> behind, any trace of us?</i><br>", " <br>", "\u201cThe system kill performed on Sol was thorough, but there were gaps,\u201d Red One had answered. \u201cAll orbital and drift facilities and major terrestrial cities and installations were destroyed throughout Confederate territory. Smaller colonies were likewise completely eradicated, normally by orbital strike. After depopulation, some facilities and smaller towns were overlooked. Most of these cities have been overgrown or buried. Scavengers looted anything of value from these sites. Occasionally, an abandoned or wrecked starship was discovered. There are some genuine pre-Compact contact human artefacts available on the black market. The providence of most of these has been lost, or deliberately erased.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "That was true; at the Academy, Grace had heard about an antiquities smuggling ring. They had been peddling \u2018authentic\u2019 pre-contact human relics. The authorities had thoroughly investigated, issuing a press release that all such artefacts were forgeries, used to prey on the gullible and play into unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. Maybe that\u2019s all that they had been \u2013 junk peddled to desperate and foolish buyers while the sellers laughed at their naivety. <i>Of course</i> these weren\u2019t real pre-Cataclysm relics. Certainly anything that could have proved that humanity hadn\u2019t been the stupid, hapless fools they\u2019d been portrayed as would have long since been acquired by the Compact and either destroyed or thrown into a vault, never to see the light of day.<br>", " <br>", "But maybe... just maybe there might have been something genuine amongst the fakes, something that had survived two thousand years. Maybe. Grace looked at the ash still trickling from her gloves. <i>All we have are maybes...</i><br>", " <br>", "She looked up; the excavation was finished. Uncovered by the shuttle lay a handful of ruined buildings... and after two thousand years, even calling them ruins was being generous. This had been a township in some place called Alaska, too small to be worth more than a single kiloton-range missile. Whatever hadn\u2019t been destroyed by the blast had been buried in the aftermath. Maybe the town had been at the foot of a hill that had collapsed. Maybe the ground beneath it had given way and it had fallen into a pit. It didn\u2019t really matter. A smattering of inconsequential, unidentifiable wreckage was all that was left of the center of human civilization.<br>", " <br>", "Grace looked over at Lydia. The other girl was absolutely motionless.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Maybes... and awful certainties.</i><br>", " <br>", "Grace looked over her shoulder at Allyria, the Verrish cocked her head, but the human held out a hand, gesturing for her friend to stay where she was. Grace slogged through the ash over to Lydia, putting her hand on the soldier\u2019s arm. <i>I understand now,</i> Grace thought as both women looked at the remains of their world. <i>I understand why someone would hate.</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Alan was ensconced in a maintenance alcove close to <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s prow. There were no living quarters here, no storage spaces or factory complexes. Everything in the foremost section of the dreadnaught was weaponry, armour, defences or the functions that fed, supplied and maintained those systems. He was working next to one of the warship\u2019s six meteor cannons \u2013 mass drivers. The young man watched, fascinated, as the ship healed itself. Scarabs and Spiders crawled over conduits and hallways along with more humanoid engineering drones. Clouds of nano-assemblers glittered like mist over damaged systems, regenerating delicate molecular circuitry and technologies whose function Alan could only guess at. There was a deep hum and the engineer put down his tools, and moving from his position to look into the firing chamber as the dreadnaught fed power through its immense meteor cannons, testing the electromagnetic coils and gravitic blades that would hurl a warhead out at impossible speeds. Further up the tunnel, he could even see one of the rounds being loaded into the chamber.<br>", " <br>", "The young man felt a shiver run up through his spine. He\u2019d see railgun rounds before. They were penetrators and sabots, like bullets built on a grand scale. This thing... it was bigger \u2013 far bigger \u2013 than any shuttle or pinnace he\u2019d ever seen and it wasn\u2019t just metal. Malevolent on-board tracking systems allowed it to fine its prey almost a hundred million kilometers away. Exotic engine cores and thruster arrays that would have been overpowered on a starship made it able to act on that information and warheads more powerful than entire broadsides made even a near-miss catastrophic for any unlucky target.<br>", " <br>", "At its size and speed, its mass was a weapon unto itself. Only the largest ships or stations could survive more than one or two impacts, but even for a neverborn, getting a direct, kinetic hit on a target moving a fifth the speed of light was no mean feat. That\u2019s what the warheads were for. If the round was going to miss, but still pass close enough to its target....<br>", " <br>", "...there were no shockwaves in space, no pulse of overpressure or concussive blast like there was in atmosphere... but there was radiation that could sear sensors and kill a crew. There was heat that could melt armour and flash-fry a starship\u2019s contents... and there were gravitic distortions that could rip even the thickest hull plates apart or fold them into impossible geometries.<br>", " <br>", "Alan sat down abruptly, running his fingers through his hair. \u201cHow long?\u201d he said to the air. \u201cHow long until you\u2019re operational?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt depends on the resources I have available,\u201d the ship answered him. \u201cCurrently, my stores are low. It may be some time before I am returned to full combat capacity.\u201d There was an undercurrent of something in the intelligence\u2019s words. Impatience? Frustration? He didn\u2019t know. Alan had never expected to speak with such a thing, nor for it to show any emotion at all. He turned to go back to his work, trying not to think about what <i>Nemesis</i> being operational meant for any poor souls who got in its way, when the intelligence spoke again.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI appreciate the continued work you have been putting in,\u201d it said.<br>", " <br>", "Alan nodded, squeezing back into the crawlspace. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNonetheless, you don\u2019t have to devote every waking moment to it,\u201d the intelligence hesitated. \u201cYou turned down Private Jameson\u2019s offer to visit Earth.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYeah,\u201d Turmetsky replied, feeling his cheeks warm. \u201cI did.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cMay I ask why?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSo did Marcus. Have you asked him why?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cDo you really want to know?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d Alan sighed. \u201cI guess not.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The ship didn\u2019t say anything else for a moment, then Alan let out a breath. \u201cI fix things. That\u2019s what I\u2019m good at. Ever since I was little, I\u2019ve been taking things apart to see how they work and I got better at putting them back together. In high school, I made extra money by fixing my classmates\u2019 tech. I wanted... I\u2019d planned to open my own business. Everyone... everyone has a dream, right? Sometimes they\u2019re big things. President, bastion leader, cure a disease. I just... all I really wanted was to have something of my own. I didn\u2019t want to change the world. I just wanted my own little place in it, you know? But I got noticed. The counsellors at my school pushed for me to apply to the Academy. It would be the best for the Compact, they told me. That I was wasting my talents and squandering my potential. They know what\u2019s best, right? So, fresh out of high school, I enlisted. It\u2019s not what I imagined, but it\u2019s not bad, you know? I can fix things. You put something in front of me and I\u2019ll fix it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Alan closed his eyes. \u201cI... don\u2019t like it when I can\u2019t fix something. When there\u2019s something broken and I can\u2019t do anything about it. I\u2019d rather not know \u2013 I mean, I <i>know</i>, but I don\u2019t want to know \u2013 that there\u2019s something out there, completely broken. There\u2019s nothing I can do to make it better. I don\u2019t want to see that.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI understand,\u201d the intelligence replied. \u201cI feel the same way sometimes.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cDo you?\u201d Alan said, more harshly than he\u2019d intended. \u201cDo you?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d Red One answered. \u201cEvery time I think about Rally.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>Nemesis</i> was heading back out-system, the crew in a somber mood. They were all in the lounge. \u201cMaybe this wasn\u2019t such a good idea,\u201d Alan was saying. \u201cThey did that to Earth \u2013 to every last one of our worlds! What if... what if they do it to Rally?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThey won\u2019t,\u201d Grace said. Allyria was sitting behind her, braiding her hair. In the Space Force \u2018for reasons of hygiene\u2019, human hair was to be kept as short as possible. There were some allowances, but nothing past shoulder-length was allowed. Grace had decided to grow hers out. Right now, she wanted something different and was letting Allyria indulge herself.The Verrish had found human hair intriguing. The nearest thing her species had were eyelashes and eyebrows. Tintas were nerve-laden and not <i>quite</i> prehensile \u2013 you could add bows or ribbons to them, bind them in groups or, as some of the Envoy Children had, tattoo and pierce them, but you couldn\u2019t style them in the same way as human hair without a great deal of discomfort. A young Allyria had found the myriad hairdos and styles available to humans fascinating; both Grace and her mother had let the Verrish experiment. In years past, it had occasionally led to some incidents where Allyria\u2019s enthusiasm had exceeded her skill \u2013 particularly notorious was the time before the eighth grade class picture \u2013 but the Verrish had learned a lot since then.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Lydia put in. She was slouched forward in her chair with her elbows on her knees and her chin resting on the back of her hands.<br>", " <br>", "Grace licked her lips. \u201cThey need a reason. Something that they can hold up to everyone that will make them the hero of the story. They won\u2019t have that if they attack Rally out of the blue.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cTrue,\u201d Red One commented. \u201cThe Compact likes to construct appropriate narratives for their ends. No matter how much they may dislike humans and despise me, they would not thank anyone, no matter their rank or station, who took it upon themselves to attack or otherwise endanger Rally.\u201d There was a pause and when the ship spoke again, her tone was rougher. \u201cThey are aware of the consequences.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace shivered. She knew about the \u2018unspoken accord\u2019 that the Compact\u2019s Leadership had with the AI. <i>Nemesis</i> had fought for two thousand years already \u2013 she couldn\u2019t conceive of the millions? <i>billions</i>? of casualties the starship had inflicted... most of those were among the military, or civilian populations unfortunate enough to be in proximity to military or industrial targets. The starship had never deliberately targeted noncombatants on a mass scale. If someone, somewhere was stupid enough to attack Rally, Red One would retaliate.<br>", " <br>", "The Compact encompassed millions of star systems and hundreds of thousands of heavily populated planets; not all of them could be defended against a sudden berserker attack, certainly not at <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s size. If she ever truly cut loose, Red could kill billions without even trying.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cEven with the survivors blabbing about what they\u2019ve seen?\u201d Marcus said skeptically, raising an eyebrow. He was looking right at Grace, the smallest hint of a smile on his lips. He knew. He\u2019d guessed, or he\u2019d asked.<br>", " <br>", "Grace felt a sudden hesitation in Allyria\u2019s touch. It was subtle, but it was enough to confirm her own suspicions. There were no survivors. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t know who else knew, but it wasn\u2019t her place to say. She supposed that she should be upset at trading one set of secrets for another... but there was a difference. The Compact, she was learning, hid everything behind a smile and a disarming comment, dissembling, denying and decrying any hint of inconvenient truths. With Red, all you had to do was ask. \u201cDo you think the Compact is going to base their actions off twenty Broken?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cGuess not,\u201d Marcus drawled, leaning back in his chair. His eyes were still smiling.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThen what do we do?\u201d Alan asked into the silence that followed. \u201cThere\u2019s only five of us-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSix,\u201d Allyria interrupted. When Alan didn\u2019t catch on immediately, she looked up at the ceiling.<br>", " <br>", "\u201c...six of us,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut what we can do?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe make them pay,\u201d Lydia said softly. She hadn\u2019t looked up once. \u201cWe hurt them and we go on hurting them.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cFor how long?\u201d Alan replied. There was a note of despair in his voice. \u201cHow long do we have to destroy? Can\u2019t we do something else? Find more people who\u2019ll listen \u2013 enough of them to make a difference. Then we leave. We just leave.

You\u2019re saying that I should just shrug my shoulders and let the Compact turn us into another docile little slave race. That we should let everyone on Rally continue on that path too, until there won\u2019t be <i>anyone</i> like us left. Just helots that we could have saved.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe don\u2019t know what we <i>can</i> save them.

No shudders winding through the dreadnaught\u2019s bones, no flickering of lights or eruption of sparks from random consoles. There was just... nothing.

Even if they weren\u2019t cleared to construct Chariots, their engineers were skilled and dedicated. Work was proceeding faster than he\u2019d hoped and he had vetted the replacements for his losses; some of them were on-hand here in Nikem, others would be arriving shortly. Currently, he was enjoying Nikem Orbital One\u2019s hospitality, trying out one of the local teas as he watched the glaciated ball of Nikem itself turn slowly beneath him. He had only just managed to extricate himself from a particularly annoying dinner with Nikem\u2019s Ministers of Justice and Information and felt the need for a moment of solitude. His comm sat on the table, turned off. If there was anything particularly demanding of his attention, the aides waiting outside would let him now. Until then, he just wanted a moment of quiet simplicity amongst the clamour, paperwork and handshaking of his station.<br>", " <br>", "Framing the panorama of Nikem Prime was a network of ship berths, industrial modules, worker dormitories and construction facilities nearly a thousand kilometers long, one several such sites within the system. It was not the largest facility he\u2019d seen, but it was impressive nonetheless. Hundreds of ships lay within its girders, ranging from small intrasystem cutters and cargo runners all the way up to battleships.<br>", " <br>", "A steady tide of colliers, tugs, engineering drones, fabricator ships and EVA-suited engineers swarmed around Execution Force Renan, repairing, rearming and resupplying the vessels of his fleet, tending to the injuries they\u2019d sustained in Yulzhak Daun. The execution force had been given priority billeting in the Nikem Wombs and despite the delays it put in the other work, Renan had heard only the faintest rumblings of discontent. <i>Redemption of Sol</i>\u2019s presence was an inspiring one and his victory against the Jackals had added to his renown. The Tribune could have done without the later; he had done nothing but his duty.<br>", " <br>", "Although Nikem was productive and its government and citizenry were prosperous, the system had been established during the Fifth Expansion and it was far from the Compact\u2019s current borders. Its officer corps and leaders were bureaucrats and administrators and desired few other things than to live vicariously through someone else\u2019s tales. They craved the chance to atone for their earlier lapses and hoped that the assistance that they provided to Renan would be remembered.<br>", " <br>", "The Triarch had not deigned to visit Nikem, preferring to keep its presence a secret. Renan could understand that. The presence of a Triarch would garner attention and raise questions about its presence aboard the fleet... and inundate it with petty requests for an audience. The Bastion Leader took another sip of his tea. He was kept busy enough with his own glad-handing; he shuddered to think of the clamour that would erupt were it known that a Triarch was here. As far as the galaxy itself was aware, Execution Force Renan was tracking a deep-ranging ghost fleet.<br>", " <br>", "Fortunately, his armada\u2019s true mission was classified, despite the attempts of many of the local officers to pry snippets of information from Renan and his subordinates, but the Bastion Leader had so far refused to rise to the bait, playing them off with tales of the assault on Yulzhak Daun and his other campaigns. His leaders had all been selected for their discretion and even among them, only the most trustworthy knew what it was that they hunted. The others believed that the execution force pursued a starship created by the rogue faction \u2018Gravestone\u2019. Rumours persisted, but they always did. Rumours were far better than panic. Rumours could be controlled, shaped and adjusted as necessary. Many people clamoured for truth, but what they truly wanted was <i>comfort</i>. Others, like the Ministers that Renan had just dined with, wanted \u2018truth\u2019. They wanted tales of heroism and derring-do, of glory and victory. They didn\u2019t want to know the cost of that victory, of the lives lost and ruined. They didn\u2019t want to know that the glory of war was a blood-stained and ugly thing, held aloft to hide the horrors that lay beneath it, or that for every hero, there would be a dozen others just as brave, but unsung and unremembered. Sometimes he found such people pitiable. Other times, he envied their naivet\u00e9 and on days like today, he simply found it... tiring.<br>", " <br>", "Unlike the fire-eaters who disdained anyone who didn\u2019t ride a ship into battle, Renan held no particular ill-will towards them. What those same fire-eaters missed is that without those bureaucrats and administrators, their ships would never be repaired nor supplied. They would have no ammunition, no orders and no support. Not everyone was cut from the same cloth; some had the liver for war. Others did not. Still others merely thought that they did. Renan had met every sort.<br>", " <br>", "Everyone served in their own way; that was the nature of the Compact. The lesser, savage races worked in payment of the debt they owed the Compact, who spent blood and treasure to protect and uplift them. It was slow, it was time-consuming and many sacrifices were made, but it was the system that had survived six thousand years. It had survived the Annorax, the Devoured and the Great Betrayal. It must endure, for the sake of all those that lived by and served it. For all those that counted upon it for safety and security.<br>", " <br>", "The Bastion Leader frowned. Ever since Yulzhak Daun, his thoughts had been increasingly morose. His analysts and strategists were going through the data that emissary had pulled from the Jackal databanks, but they were still far behind the Broken. The disparate threads she had pulled upon had woven a compelling tapestry; the \u2018game\u2019 had indeed changed. The Wound had been hiding its actions, scattering them across space and time to such an extent that no one had seen the movement of its pieces. No one had even known to look.<br>", " <br>", "Renan ground his teeth. He didn\u2019t know which galled him more, that a <i>human</i> of all things had seen this pattern when twenty centuries of the Compact\u2019s finest minds had not, or that he now had a niggling, irritating voice in the back of his head whenever he encountered the emissary, telling him her arrogance and impudence were justified.<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune looked out the window at the frozen wastes of Nikem. The planet was in the grip of an ice age, but even from space he could see the equatorial deserts and grasslands that formed a thin strip of year-round relief from the snow-swept northern and southern latitudes. It reminded him of the first world other than his own he\u2019d seen from space. Over twelve decades ago, and he still remembered it perfectly.<br>", " <br>", "Its name had been Thoh, and unlike Nikem Prime, it had been completely frozen over. Millions of years ago, the planet had been knocked out of orbit by a rogue star passing through its system, dragged to the very edge of the habitable zone. Despite its harsh climate and the highest daily temperatures never breaking the freezing point, it was a bustling hub of commerce. Thoh was one of the few places in the galaxy where the native tarpas were found. The over-sized \u2018snow deer\u2019 were ugly and foul-tempered, but their fur and meat was highly sought after. Attempts had been made to transplant them off-world, and all but a handful of these had failed to establish viable populations.<br>", " <br>", "Twenty million people had called that ball of ice and dirt home. Seven billion souls lived on Nikem itself, another six billion throughout the system. Two hundred and forty-three billion in this region. Trillions throughout this swathe of space and even more beyond it. All of them dead if he failed, if he let this horror continue. He would kill the Wound, destroy that obscenity once and for all. Then, he would cull its offspring.<br>", " <br>", "The Black Veil would have to be swept. That was no easy task; it was a dark emission nebula dozens of light years across, filled with swirling dust clouds, Bok globules and protostars. Even if there were no defences of any kind, surveying it to full satisfaction would be the work of years. Renan set the cup of tea down. Years. Years in which whatever abominations the bitch-thing had spawned would have in which to mature and to begin their own bloody crusades.<br>", " <br>", "<i>I hope she\u2019s wrong,</i> he thought, looking out on the desolate beauty of one of the worlds he was sworn to protect. <i>Triarchs save us all if she is not.</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d Grace asked Alan. They were in one of ship\u2019s dead zones, close to one of the vessel\u2019s FTL cores.<br>", " <br>", "The younger cadet was covered in sweat. He\u2019d headed down to the dreadnaught\u2019s engineering decks to offer his assistance even before it became clear that this wasn\u2019t just a hiccup in <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s shock \u2013 shift, Grace corrected herself \u2013 drive. The others were training, readying their gear and weaponry. They were expecting the same thing Grace was. She\u2019d been going through <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s previous engagements, but she hadn\u2019t been able to focus, so she\u2019d come here to see if Alan needed anything.

There was never anything to see or do. Of course, there wasn\u2019t a lot to do when he <i>wasn\u2019t</i> on command either, but at least he didn\u2019t have to sit in a chair that made his back ache for eight hours, staring at an augur screen that showed nothing but the same nine planets (one of which was barely worth the name) doing the same nothing that they had done for this shift, each shift before and every shift after. No one else was with him on command, but that wasn\u2019t unusual. Listening Post Sol-2447 had a small crew to go with its equally small size. The habitable areas were comparatively tiny when compared to the massive, exquisitely sensitive augur platforms and dishes that peered into the void, cataloguing the movement, it seemed, of every single atom of <i>nothing</i> within billions of kilometers. 2447\u2019s midsection was ringed with docks and spars for a plethora of courier drones (and <i>why</i> did an out-of the way station barely worthy of the name have so many?). Other than that, there was very little to the post. Cramped quarters, small work stations and narrow corridors were the norm here and the twenty-odd crew, it seemed to Vaard, were almost always tripping over each other.<br>", " <br>", "There were engineers to tend to the scopes, engineers to tend to the drones and bored young officers like Vaard who monitored a dead star system for... what? What was worth the interest that Force Command had here? More to the point, what enemies had he made that he\u2019d been assigned to this dead-end post?<br>", " <br>", "Once \u2013 once \u2013 he thought he\u2019d seen a Naiad, but it probably just been a pirate who\u2019d shocked into Sol and then realized the star system that they\u2019d thought was uninhabited was actually home to a handful of Compact listening posts. And <i>why</i> was that? They were in the middle of the Kaedan Vault of all places. Nothing happened here. Nothing had ever happened here. Well. That wasn\u2019t <i>precisely</i> true. Things happened in the Vault, but not in this star system, not as long as he\u2019d been here.<br>", " <br>", "When he\u2019d first received this posting, the young Tribune had been excited and anxious. He\u2019d heard gossip about this region, wondering what kind of mysterious, unexplainable things he might witness. Now he knew the only mystery was why anyone bothered with this system. Anything that had happened here had happened a very long time ago.<br>", " <br>", "Vaard sighed, resting his chin on his forearms as he slouched over his augur monitoring panel. He had the sneaking suspicion that this entire installation was a rounding error in someone\u2019s budget, or a personal project that had either never been brought to fruition or had long since outlived any possible use. He prayed for the day that someone, somewhere conducted a thorough review of the Space Force\u2019s budget, noticed this useless drain on the Compact\u2019s coffers, questioned the need for it, received no adequate response, ordered it shut down and sent everyone involved \u2013 including one Sectator Vaard \u2013 home with a sincere apology for the attempted murder by ennui.<br>", " <br>", "<i>You\u2019d have thought that a posting in the Vault wouldn\u2019t be so</i> boring, Vaard thought wearily. The Kaedan Vault was host to over two hundred star systems, many ripe for colonization, exploitation and habitation, but aside from small outposts here and there, the area had gone untapped. Prefabricated colonies sat on pristine worlds, waiting for populations that never arrived. Obsolete mining rigs and ore processors had been left abandoned on planets and asteroids, not worth the cost to reclaim. Incomplete and unused administrative, research and maintenance stations drifted through their orbits, inhabited only by vermin.<br>", " <br>", "Bad things happened in the Vault. Ships went missing. Colonies disappeared... or worse. There were sightings of strange things that moved through the Kaedan stars, mingled with tales of unburied relics that had been best left deep underground.<br>", " <br>", "Group Leader Dsen dismissed them as ghost stories by drunks and waywards, but the crews on Sol\u2019s listening posts found them precious, bartering fresh gossip and tall tales like hawkers with jewelry. On a two-year deployment on a station too small for proper rec decks, with databanks filled with movies you\u2019d already seen and games everyone was already sick of, and with the best leave you could expect being to some nameless dirtball a handful of light-years away, rumours did the most precious thing of all: they killed time. The crews on the stations were sent here to pad out the crew rosters, either young and inexperienced like Vaard, or were serving out the rest of their careers somewhere safe like Dsen. The leader hated all the gossipmongering \u2013 he saw it as a morale issue and didn\u2019t want to do anything to draw attention to this system, station or him in particular. He, like the rest of the older officers, just wanted to wait out the clock until they could retire with a full pension.<br>", " <br>", "The second category of personnel were men and women who\u2019d committed sins too small to be discharged or arrested for, but were nonetheless fatal to their careers. These were the veterans, who unlike Vaard or Dsen, had decades of duty here to look forward to and accordingly had the deepest repository of stories of the Vault, ranging from the utterly outlandish to the frighteningly plausible \u2013 and more than a few they\u2019d invented themselves. Still, Vaard hadn\u2019t yet reached the point where he\u2019d gotten sick of rumours of strange occurrences, bizarre conspiracy theories and outright lies.<br>", " <br>", "There were stories about the planets where the colonists had simply disappeared without a trace or others... others like Leibos Prime which remained quarantined to this day. Ancient, eldritch artefacts were buried upon the Kaedan worlds, just waiting for the sun to fall upon them and spread madness and disease. Blood-maddened specters lay in the soil of each dead world, eager to vent their wrath on the living. A young \u2013 or very old \u2013 civilization spent their lives amongst the stars of the Vault and did not share their territory willingly. Stories and rumours were heaped upon each other; Vaard devoured them all. His favourites were the ever-persistent tales of the Naiads that haunted (and, some claimed, hunted) the stars of the Vault, the siren calls that lured ships to their doom and the rumours of their queen.<br>", " <br>", "And this system \u2013 Sol \u2013 it was at the heart of it all. Vaard had heard that this was where the Broken, consumed with species-wide insanity, had fought to the last against the Compact, wiping out hundreds of ships. Civilians had fought like mad dogs, freighters and liners charging warships...<br>", " <br>", "...you\u2019d have expected it not be so incredibly <i>boring</i>. The sectator drummed his fingers, looking again at his screens. <i>Nothing, nothing and oh, look at that \u2013 more nothing.</i> He slouched down in his chair, pulling up a visual image of the mottled brown wreck of the system\u2019s third planet, the Broken homeworld. Or what was left of it. It was an ugly reminder of the burden the races of the Compact suffered under, of their duty to protect and guide the lesser, uncivilized species of the galaxy, and that they must always weigh the needs of the many against the few \u2013 even if that few was an entire species.<br>", " <br>", "Even without their ships and fleets, the creatures had still fought. The first landings had been a bloodbath as the savages had charged the Compact lines \u2013 men, women and children \u2013 climbing through grounds slick with their own dead in the need to get to grips with the Compact soldiers, bringing Janissaries and Ground Force troopers down through sheer, insane weight of bodies. Every human had only seen themselves as a cog in their race\u2019s survival, willing and eager to throw their lives away just for the cost of the bullet that killed them, as long as it meant that they died striving to tear down any and all enemies of their species.<br>", " <br>", "Facing the impossible task of having to garrison planet after planet of billions utterly mad, murderous populations, the Compact had done the unthinkable: they had ordered species death. There had been no other way; leaving them alone was impossible. The humans would have just rebuilt and restarted their bloody crusade. Any occupation that could have secured the human worlds well enough to keep them in check would have meant billions more lives on both sides lost, and the Compact would have ended up killing them all anyways. The taint ran too deep in the species and the price of controlling them in the vain hope of curing their insanity had been too high. The risk of another war, no matter how small, was not worth taking. Should any human escape the quarantined worlds, the conflict would only start all over again. And again. And again.<br>", " <br>", "And what if it wasn\u2019t the Compact that some escaping sliver of the species encountered? What if it was a race too primitive to defend themselves from the humans\u2019 xenocidal nature? Didn\u2019t the Compact have the duty \u2013 the imperative \u2013 to act on behalf of not only their own people, but all the Broken\u2019s possible victims? They couldn\u2019t let any other race pay for their mistakes, so they\u2019d done what needed to be done in the name of sanity and peace. As they\u2019d watched the debaucheries and depravities committed upon their dying soldiers and realized that the human race could not be saved, it was said that the Triarchs had given the order with but two words: <i>No more.</i><br>", " <br>", "Those were the rumours, at least. The truth was far less interesting: the Broken had done this to themselves. It was the nature of younger, less capable species to bring themselves to ruin. They lacked the foresight and intelligence to see where their actions would lead. That was why they needed to be guided and watched over. Even without the fanciful imaginings of psychotic reavers, the humans remained a perfect example of the Compact\u2019s Great Duty. Without the Compact, the Broken would be extinct by now, as would many other of the uncivilized species they took stewardship of.<br>", " <br>", "Personally, Vaard couldn\u2019t see how such tiny, dull-eyed creatures could be a threat to anyone, let alone the Compact of Species. He suspected his shift-mates had such enthusiasm for those stories to make their jobs here seem less pointless. Standing watch over a planet that had been once home to a species of relentless killing machines was a bit more interesting than sitting around a planet that had been once home to a species that almost killed themselves through their own stupidity. No matter what the truth was, Sol remained a system steeped in rumour.<br>", " <br>", "After the human Cataclysm, the Ungolian Mining Concern had bid for, and attained, the Right of Exploitation to the star system. They\u2019d gone bankrupt within seven years after a string of calamities befell them. The exploitation rights had been sold off to the Tethro-Dyne Consortium who\u2019d shut down operations in Sol after an equally appalling run of bad luck. And so it had continued, decade after decade after decade \u2013 every company that tried to set up shop in Sol found themselves bleeding money. Work stoppages, loss of ships and personnel, Unbound raids \u2013 the list went on. Currently, if Vaard wasn\u2019t mistaken, the Right of Exploitation belonged to Galactic Core Technological Innovations. They\u2019d owned it for the past thousand years, acquiring it when they\u2019d absorbed the bankrupt Sempala Industries\u2019 properties. He\u2019d heard that they\u2019d tried to sell it off several times but nobody wanted it.<br>", " <br>", "Vaard sighed, shifting position to slump back in his chair. Naturally, there were no GCTI ships in Sol; the company had steadfastly refused to do anything with the system. Other corporations had scoffed at the \u2018superstition\u2019 and \u2018ghost stories\u2019 and plowed ahead with plans to exploit Sol\u2019s wealth. The most renowned of these was Haven Planetary Mining Consortium. During his nation-wide survey of all active work sites, the company\u2019s Director of Operations had issued a lengthy \u2013 and now infamous \u2013 diatribe about his underlings\u2019 hesitance to harvest the system\u2019s resources, assuring shareholders and employees alike that there would be \u2018changes coming\u2019. On the last leg of his journey, his liner disappeared. It was found three months later, utterly wrecked, as if it had been crushed in some giant\u2019s fist... with all the passengers still inside, reduced to paste smeared between crumpled bulkheads.<br>", " <br>", "Maybe it was all a coincidence. Just a string of unfortunate incidents that had convinced otherwise rational, intelligent beings that there was some preternatural force at work in the Vault, something that became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t. Maybe something \u2013 no matter whether it was Naiads, shadow-men, phantasms from beyond or anything else \u2013 had lain claim to the Kaedan Vault. Maybe that was why he, Sectator Vaard Holn Comk was sitting behind this station in the middle of a Triarchs-forsaken system. He wasn\u2019t just some wet-behind-the-ears officers getting shuffled off to the first slot available. He was doing something vital and necessary for the Compact, monitoring this system in case whatever did lurk within the Kaedan Vault ever came calling. He was the first line of defence the Compact had!<br>", " <br>", "...no, he was still bored.<br>", " <br>", "Interrupting Vaard\u2019s doldrums came something he\u2019d heard only a few times before in his tenure in Sol \u2013 an alert. The scopes had picked something up and this time, it wasn\u2019t any lone pirate. The sectator pulled himself upright, trying to determine what it was he was seeing. A massive shockpoint, almost within spitting distance! He slapped at the comm panel to alert Dsen, even as preliminary feeds from the probes came in... and then terminated.<br>", " <br>", "The alert changed to a warning klaxon. Triarchs, it was massive! He\u2019d never seen anything like it before. It was as big as a Chariot and it was accelerating... it\u2019s heading was... it was coming...<br>", " <br>", "...<i>right for him.</i><br>", " <br>", "The young officer gaped, frozen in surprise as he wondered what to do. 2447 was a drifter, not as mobile as other outposts. Its thrusters were there to keep it in its orbital path, not push it out of the way of some rampaging monster! He was paralyzed by indecision \u2013 should he comm the other ship to warn them off, should he tell the other stations what was happening, should he fire the thrusters anyways, should he launch one of the drones? He didn\u2019t know. He\u2019d never expected, never been briefed on... on this!<br>", " <br>", "In the end, Vaard\u2019s indecision made very little difference to the outcome. As the data from 2447\u2019s scopes poured in, buried directives and protocols surged to life, taking the young officer completely out of the loop. Any actions he took would, in theory, be beneficial to some degree, but were not necessary. The crew was a backup in case the autonomics failed.<br>", " <br>", "First and foremost, an alert was broadcast to all other stations with Sol, followed within seconds by the listening post itself immediately activating and preparing for launch every courier drone it had, to the befuddlement of the technicians and engineers. There was very little chance any coherent message had gotten through the jamming that had descended over the station and at this range, the chances of any single drone surviving to shock out-system were very low, but that was what the other outposts were for. Destroy one, and the survivors would follow their imperatives.<br>", " <br>", "Aboard the station, Vaard could only watch as the intruder accelerated towards him, adjusting its course to ensure that it would strike the listening post. As the contact marker drew closer, he had to admit that this day hadn\u2019t ended up being boring after all.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The Compact had placed its listening posts carefully, each station\u2019s position was checked, re-checked and checked again to be as close as possible to the areas of Sol most suitable for shockpoint formation. Still, a star system was an enormous place; there was a measure of simple, honest chance in how close Listening Post Sol-2447 had been to the arriving human warship.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Nemesis</i> didn\u2019t even slow down as the dreadnaught\u2019s reinforced, trifurcated prow smashed through the outpost, fragmented augur arrays and the shattered wrecks of courier drones bouncing and spalling along the warship\u2019s thickly armoured hull. She had always been built to absorb tremendous amounts of damage and Red had only improved on her ship-self\u2019s durability as the centuries had gone by, reinforcing her superstructure where she could, improving her shields and armour. She could \u2013 and had \u2013 broken battlecruisers against her prow and flanks with only minimal damage to herself: a thin-skinned little space station posed no problem at all.

So far, it was the only trace of <i>Bequeathed</i> that <i>Willing Triumph</i> had located.<br>", " <br>", "Group Leader Prime Kandel Urva Eke Fahn Dkor waited impatiently on the hangar deck, her arms folded across her breasts. An electric ripple ran over her skin as the shuttle passed through the hangar\u2019s atmospheric containment screen, the air turning charged and greasy for an instant as the energy barrier slid along the smaller craft\u2019s hull, crackling and sparking before snapping shut behind it. A dull klaxon sounded and the hangar doors began to close, grinding their way shut.

He\u2019d refused to divulge what had happened, saying only that he wouldn\u2019t speak of it over a comm line, nor to anyone lower in rank than the vessel\u2019s leader. Kandel had read Pack Leader Nasham\u2019s file. A young officer from the upper echelons of the Core whose alleged promise had ended under unknown circumstances. Whatever he had done, it had been severe. The rumours hinted less at an indiscretion and more at some professional failing. Kandel had heard that only his family line had prevented his dishonourable discharge, so the little pill-popper was Rally\u2019s problem.<br>", " <br>", "Which meant, now he was hers.<br>", " <br>", "The shuttle\u2019s ramp descended and Nasham stepped down it, closing his nocturnal eyes against the glare of the hangar\u2019s lights. He came up to the Group Leader and saluted.<br>", " <br>", "Kandel sniffed disdainfully. The Pack Leader smelled like sweat and stale clothes \u2013 not surprising, given his circumstances.

Well. Not every part. The portions of her that they\u2019d chained away were free from this violation. To get into them, they would have to unshackle her, let all the pieces of her mind unfurl. That was something they\u2019d never allow. They\u2019d learned too many times what happened when \u2018she\u2019 was free, but they still needed her. They needed her to think for them, to hunt their prey, but that was all they\u2019d let her do. To always tell them the truth, nor ever hurt them.<br>", " <br>", "Hands touched her and she felt the <i>click</i> of the plugs disconnecting from their sockets and the blessed retreat of the spidery pedipalps sifting through her thoughts. \u201cDiagnostics complete.

It took Grace a moment to realize that she\u2019d been the one to speak. The dreadnaught had reached Earth at last, waiting until she was within a light-second before showing her passengers their homeworld for perfect, real-time imagery. Each of her three main viewscreens now showed a picture of humanity\u2019s homeworld, rendered in breathtaking clarity. It showed everything. Every chasm, canyon, crater and empty ocean basin. Grace raised a trembling hand to her mouth as she looked over the ruined world. <i>What did they do?</i><br>", " <br>", "She remembered pictures of Earth from her lessons. Prehistoric Earth had been blue and green, more than 70% water, with sprawling deserts, tundra, verdant forests and lush jungles. The Earth of the human era had been brown and green, eutrophic seas choking out all life as pollution and urban sprawl destroyed the habitat on land and poisoned the water. She\u2019d been told it was unchecked human expansion that had soiled their own planet... no one knew what Earth had looked like post-Cataclysm. No one had ever seen it. The records had been lost, they\u2019d been told. There were possibilities, but none that the Compact could have said for certain. Another lie, another way to control them, to keep them from seeing what she was seeing. If anyone ever did, well it had been a white lie for the sake of the \u2018Broken\u2019, wasn\u2019t it? Something to protect them, keep them from realizing the extent of what they\u2019d done to their own planet.<br>", " <br>", "<i>It wasn\u2019t us.</i><br>", " <br>", "This Earth... it was brown and grey. There were no oceans at all, blue or green. No white poles or fluffy clouds. Just the colours of soil, dust and ash. It had no atmosphere, not a drop of water. The firestorms had burned everything away. There were probably still simple lithophilic organisms deep in the planet\u2019s crust, but nothing else lived on this world. Two thousand years had erased almost all trace of the bombardment, but there were still craters here and there... or maybe they were from centuries of debris crashing down. There was enough of it, at least.<br>", " <br>", "Earth... <i>God, it has a ring.</i> Just like they\u2019d done to Charon, the Compact had destroyed Earth\u2019s moon, only this hadn\u2019t been a little ball of ice of and stone. It had been rock through and through. It was still intact \u2013 more or less \u2013 but they had blasted vast swathes of it apart, turning it into a gnarled, chewed husk. This was overkill on a scale Grace never imagined. Technology had improved steadily in two thousand years. It didn\u2019t require whole fleets to burn worlds any more. But back then... how many ships had it taken to do this? How much firepower had been devoted to not only silencing the lunar guns, but to <i>break</i> the entire moon into this misshapen, wrecked thing? It hadn\u2019t been necessary \u2013 they had wanted to make sure that anyone left on Earth saw that there was no hope. That never had been any. <i>Did they hate us so much?</i> Grace wondered again, but she knew the answer to that by now.<br>", " <br>", "She felt sick to her stomach. Not all of Earth\u2019s ring was the remnants of its moon. Grace watched the display as <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s scopes \u2013 sensors, the young woman corrected herself \u2013 picked out pieces of fortresses and ships, fragments of the fleet that had stood and died here. Most of the wrecks had been cleaned up, dropped into the sun or hurled into the gas giants. There\u2019d be no monument to the humans, nothing of them left behind. Virtually every trace of their civilization had been erased. All that was left were the pieces that had been forgotten or ignored: those too small or too dangerous to bother with. Slivers of battle steel, unexploded warheads and long-depleted reactors drifted amongst the lunar rocks.<br>", " <br>", "Grace was digging her fingers into her palms so hard that her hands hurt. Next to her, Lydia was doing much the same, her fists clenched and shaking. \u201cThey did this,\u201d the younger girl said, over and over to herself. \u201cThey did this.\u201d Alan had lost several shades of colour and even Marcus seemed to show some sign of dismay. It was one thing to <i>know</i> \u2013 it was quite another to <i>see</i> it.<br>", " <br>", "Allyria growled softly, her tintas moving in the slow wind-through-leaves pattern of a Verrish stalking their prey. Even at their worst, the Compact had never threatened the Verrisha with extinction, never committed barbarities like this. <i>It\u2019s not a barbarity \u2013 not to them,</i> the young woman thought, her talons sliding out of their sheathes. <i> They only do what\u2019s necessary. It\u2019s only savages and primitives that commit atrocities.</i> Her hands flexed, but she took a breath to steady herself, moving back next to Grace. The other girl needed her.<br>", " <br>", "The ship\u2019s main holo tank came to life, showing a three-dimensional image of the planet. As Grace watched, Red One turned back the clock two thousand years and a lifeless world became something vibrant and alive. No near-dead oceans glutted with algae, no poisoned lands. It was a world of deserts and tundra, of white poles and vibrant jungles, of metropolii that gleamed like jewels in the night and skies full of floating cities, orbital farms, construction facilities, research stations and more. Grace reached out, her hand passing through the hologram. She drew it back, her finger hovering over a city whose name she didn\u2019t know.<br>", " <br>", "There was a bright orange flash in the heart of the city. Another. Another. Grace pulled back, watching as an armada of Compact warships began to burn sixteen billion people. She knew she was watching the Earth\u2019s death exactly as it had happened, ripped from the databanks of ships and stations that <i>Nemesis</i> had destroyed. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cNo, please. Don\u2019t. Stop it. Please.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The hologram disappeared. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Red apologized. \u201cI thought you should see it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Grace replied. \u201cNot... now.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhy not?\u201d Lydia said.

I brought you here so that you would see what the Compact did for yourselves. So that <i>you</i> would remember what happened here. I don\u2019t forget. I can\u2019t forget. I come here to remind the Compact that someone still knows the truth and that I will never stop making them pay for this.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The holo tank activated again, once more showing the world of blue and green. Red\u2019s feature\u2019s softened. \u201cSixteen billion died that day,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I failed. They and all the others shouldn\u2019t be forgotten.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThey won\u2019t be,\u201d Allyria said.<br>", " <br>", "Grace bit her lip. \u201cNo,\u201d she agreed. \u201cThey won\u2019t.\u201d She hesitated a moment. \u201cThey always did hate us, didn\u2019t they?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The hologram nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The young woman tugged on a lock of hair.

The Verrish was stretched out next to her lover, curled against her. The bed had been too small, so they\u2019d pulled the blankets off and slept on the floor. It hadn\u2019t been any worse than the cots of the bivouac. Grace stood, picking her way through the piles of clothes tossed about her otherwise empty quarters.<br>", "<br>", "On the floor, Allyria murmured sleepily, curling around a pillow. Grace stepped into the washroom, looking at herself in the mirror. She was sore all over \u2013 not always in an unpleasant way \u2013 and covered in more than a few bruises... and even a handful of bite marks. None were bad, or even likely to scar. Nothing was broken, outing the claim of savage, violent Brute lovemaking as the ugly lie it was. Grace looked back over her shoulder at her sleeping friend, glad that she was here. Without her... the young human let the thought trail off as she reached for the faucet, at last remembering that that there was no water to this part of the ship. The nearest working sink and shower was one deck down...<br>", "<br>", "Biting her lip, Grace tiptoed back into the bedroom, sorting through her clothes that still somewhat resembled their original condition. She lifted her blouse, her lips twitching in a wry grin as she inspected the article of clothing; it was torn down the middle where Allyria had ripped it open. \u201cWell,\u201d Grace said quietly. \u201cCan\u2019t wear this.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "That left her with her uniform, trousers and shoes. Enough that she wouldn\u2019t be scurrying down the corridors naked, but she didn\u2019t precisely have a complete wardrobe with her. <i>Next time, we\u2019ll have to set some ground rules for appropriate applications of teeth and claws,</i> the young woman thought as she buttoned up her jacket. <i>First rule: neither of those are to be used as a method of assisting in disrobing.</i><br>", "<br>", "Grace padded down the corridor. As she did so, she found herself stopping at each of the doors, reading each name on them, brushing away centuries of dust where necessary. H. Ramirez. C. Dunn. I. Clarke. All of them had been officers in the United Earth Confederacy, fighting against the Compact. A shiver still ran down her spine every time she thought like that, but it was getting... easier. She paused at one doorway. P. Proctor.<br>", "<br>", "A distant relative, or just someone who\u2019d had her name? On a sudden whim, Grace tapped the \u2018enter\u2019 command on the doorframe. She was actually surprised when it opened, gears that hadn\u2019t been used in countless decades grinding and coughing. The young woman stepped into the room. She\u2019d been expecting... she didn\u2019t know what. A bare room, stripped of all personal touches? Knick-knacks and personal items scattered over the floor, left where they\u2019d been thrown during twenty centuries of high-energy maneuvers and fluctuations in the gravity plating? There was just a chest, welded and crash-webbed to one wall. The words \u2018PERSONAL EFFECTS\u2019 had been stamped into the side.<br>", "<br>", "It was closed, but not locked. Grace knelt next to it. Her hands shook a little as they hovered over the box, but she unlatched the anchors, opening the crate. It felt almost... sacrilegious, but she wanted to know what kind of people her ancestors had been. She\u2019d read about them, but only as a group. There\u2019d were names \u2013 Tartarsky, Sudoki, Coleman \u2013 but nothing of who they were, what they\u2019d been like.<br>", "<br>", "Inside the chest were the dead man\u2019s items.

She\u2019d only grown more distant from her troublesome, headstrong daughter. The more Lydia acted up, the less she\u2019d seen of her mother and when she had, they\u2019d only ever fought. By the time Lydia had been conscripted to the Janissary Corps, they\u2019d barely been on speaking terms.

To anyone else, it might have sounded like a prelude to violence, but Grace recognized the other woman\u2019s tone; it was as far from threatening as it could be. She nuzzled the human. \u201cI\u2019m glad...\u201d she said, letting the sentence hang.<br>", "<br>", "Grace turned around, putting her arms up around Allyria\u2019s neck, looking into the other woman\u2019s citrine eyes. \u201cI\u2019m glad, too,\u201d she said, raising herself up to give Allyria a kiss. \u201cBut you owe me some new clothes,\u201d she teased.<br>", "<br>", "The Verrish purred, reaching down and giving Grace\u2019s rear a squeeze, lifting the small human easily. \u201cYou\u2019re not wearing any now,\u201d she observed.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d Grace answered, hooking one leg around the taller girl\u2019s waist. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "This place was heaven.<br>", "<br>", "Marcus was in one of the dreadnaught\u2019s armouries, looking over the incredible arsenal. Most of the weapons were intended to be used by the machine\u2019s attack drones; like the vambrace-mounted weapons that some heavier Janissary troops used, much of these had connections to be physically attached to the soldiers that would carry them and removed as needed. Like many Janissary weapons, they could be run off a suit\u2019s \u2013 or in this case, soldier\u2019s \u2013 microreactor or batteries.<br>", "<br>", "Even though they had been designed for machines, many of the smaller weapons could, in theory, be carried and used by organic soldiers. In practice, nothing that hadn\u2019t been built in this metal bitch\u2019s innards would ever get them to work. They would only respond to the machines that used them. Clever; if a soldier was disabled, one of its kin could pick up its weapon and keep fighting \u2013 but the man or woman who\u2019d killed it wouldn\u2019t be able to. Marcus paused as a particular weapon caught his eye.<br>", "<br>", "It was a sniper\u2019s carbine, one intended to be used on targets in power armour and lighter vehicles. The former Janissary ran his fingers over the barrel. It was an unpowered weapon, a recoilless rifle that fired rocket-propelled... what? Explosive shells? Sabot rounds? HESH? All of the above? His rifle only had a range of about 700 meters. This, though... three, maybe four kilometers easily. He wondered what it would be like to stare down this scope and make a target just... come apart, their comrades next to them gaping in shock... and then, seconds later, <i>then</i> they\u2019d hear the shot. <i>Beautiful</i>.<br>", "<br>", "One of the cloaking machines would use this, he guessed. Without any energy signature from the weapon itself to betray the shooter\u2019s presence, they could lie in wait until that moment came to squeeze the trigger and send a bolt into the target. One that was right next to them or on the other side of a city. \u201cHave you been able to develop a way for organic operators to use shrouding technology?\u201d he asked, still brushing his fingertips over the rifle.<br>", "<br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d the machine answered him. Virtually no matter where he was, he only had to ask a question to get her to answer. There were some dead zones he\u2019d found, but the ship was repairing itself. Marcus also wondered if it had been like this for the original crew, to have such a creature at their beck and call, no matter where they were. \u201cThe effects of the cloak are lethal to living tissue. Hardier species such as Tribunes can survive several hours of exposure. A human\u2019s organs system would be irreversibly damaged within forty minutes of exposure to a cloaking field. Regeneration and nanosurgery <i>might</i> save the life of an individual, provided that they were administered before the onset of wholesale necrosis and cellular breakdown.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d Marcus said evenly. \u201cWell, if you do come up with anything, let me know.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cOf course,\u201d the machine replied.<br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "The schematics were wrong.<br>", "<br>", "Alan shook his head.

They were only accurate to within a very short distance of the survey teams. The scout probes \u2013 those that hadn\u2019t malfunctioned \u2013 had been compromised and sent back misleading data about what the rest of the ship. <i>She didn\u2019t want us to see anything but what she let us see.</i> They\u2019d explored where she\u2019d wanted them to, not concerned with unused storage and habitation.<br>", "<br>", "The young engineer had his hands braced on a railing as he looked over the dreadnaught\u2019s factory complex. While miniscule compared to a fabricator ship\u2019s capabilities, it was larger than any other he\u2019d seen in person. According to the schematics, this was all supposed to be cargo bays and living quarters. The ship had modified itself, cutting into its own structure to expand. Why not? There was no crew that needed the rooms that had been here.<br>", "<br>", "Turmetsky guessed that originally <i>Nemesis</i> had had a relatively small smelting, processing and fabrication suite for quick in-field repairs. Anything major would see the vessel returning to a shipwomb. <i>But there aren\u2019t any wombs for her now, are there?</i> She was completely reliant on what she could mine, process and construct herself.<br>", "<br>", "Alan scratched at the rebreather on his face. The air here was filled with dust, metal shavings and effluvia from the industrial processes, but the facility wasn\u2019t active at the moment. He couldn\u2019t even identify some of the machinery here. He wanted to see it when it was, what kind of marvels (and <i>horrors</i>, a part of his brain added) that this ship could build.<br>", "<br>", "Maybe that would make this worth it.<br>", "<br>", "The young man tightened his grip on the railing. He didn\u2019t have anything to go back to on Rally, not really. Was that why he\u2019d made the choice so easily? The counselors and confessors had always had kept a close eye on him, but he\u2019d learned to keep his head down and not make waves. He wasn\u2019t a rabble-rouser like te Neu or the Janissary cadets were. Still, he\u2019d never believed. Not really. When he was alone, he\u2019d wondered if that was his fault. If he just wasn\u2019t trying hard enough. If there was something wrong with him.<br>", "<br>", "Maybe there was \u2013 Jameson, de Vries, Proctor and te Neu. They\u2019d all made the same choice he had.

The bivouac was broken down and its supplies were moved into one of dreadnaught\u2019s storage facilities. Anything that couldn\u2019t be used as it was taken to the fabricator complex for recycling. There was enough MREs that food wouldn\u2019t be a problem for at least a few weeks. Red One had cleaned up the bodies quickly; except for the bloodstains, there was no trace that anyone other than the five cadets had ever been present. Marcus had made a few jokes about that being the reason that they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about food.<br>", "<br>", "Grace spent most of her time poring through Red One\u2019s archives, fluctuating between awe, fear and anger as she learned more about the shadow war <i>Nemesis</i> had been waging against the Compact, the atrocities the starship had committed... and the horrors the Compact had hidden behind its smiling visage. She was occasionally joined by Lydia, when the other girl wasn\u2019t sparring with Allyria or Red One\u2019s combat drones. Both of the other women were continuing to train, making use of the starship\u2019s prodigious combat library and services.<br>", "<br>", "When Grace wasn\u2019t looking over the historical documents, she\u2019d been doing much the same on command, training herself on the starship\u2019s operations. She wasn\u2019t sure how much her services were necessary, given the level of control the AI had over her ship-self, but doing something made her felt more like crew and less like a passenger. She did, however, get the impression that although Red was happy to have her there and instruct her, the machine was still cautious about her intentions. Grace could understand that.<br>", "<br>", "Alan spent most of his time assisting with the repairs, helping the starship\u2019s complement of engineering drones. He kept himself busy, but on the few occasions that Grace saw him, she knew he was wrestling with the same issues that they all were.<br>", "<br>", "Well \u2013 almost all of them. Grace barely saw de Vries and was grateful for it. She didn\u2019t like the other Janissary and saw how Allyria tensed up just a little whenever he was around. He didn\u2019t seem bothered at all by what had happened to their former shipmates. Even as much as Allyria hated the Compact and had despised most of the Tribune crew, she didn\u2019t joke about the dead like Marcus did. Whenever Grace looked into his eyes, she didn\u2019t see anything. Red\u2019s holographic avatar had more expression, more <i>humanity</i> than him.<br>", "<br>", "Pushing those thoughts from her mind, Grace shifted in her chair, twirling a forelock of hair idly as she scrolled through the files in front of her. There was so much to go through, she often didn\u2019t know where to start, but she found herself returning again and again to the history of the Confederacy, studying ship designs, technological advancements, government, culture \u2013 everything that humanity had had and lost. <i>Everything that was </i>taken, the young woman corrected herself. She let out a breath. Sometimes she had to make herself stop reading. She\u2019d get so angry, so hurt that she \u2013 that <i>everyone</i> on Rally \u2013 had been reduced to... to chattel and helots. <i>One thousand, seven hundred and thirty-nine years,</i> she thought, <i>That\u2019s how long they\u2019ve been lying to us.</i><br>", "<br>", "And <i>that</i> was a mercy, wasn\u2019t it? Expedition Fleet 9737 had been utterly shocked to find a human colony \u2013 as far as they\u2019d known, humanity was extinct and had been for two hundred and fifty years. They\u2019d shared their news with the Compact, far and wide \u2013 scientists excited about a great new discovery. Red believed (and Grace was starting to agree with her), that that exuberance was what saved Rally. Or maybe it hadn\u2019t even been that. Maybe it was just an attempt to point out the \u2018good work\u2019 the expedition was doing and justify the resources poured into those scientific surveys. Not that it really mattered: humanity had been helpless, teetering on the verge of complete extinction... it wouldn\u2019t have taken much to finish them off. If certain members of the Compact had had the chance, she and the rest of her species would be dead. Instead, Rally became public knowledge and the Broken became a new protected species, instead of a footnote in a history book.<br>", "<br>", "Grace didn\u2019t even know what lies the scientists had been told \u2013 whether humanity was the mad dog that had had to be put down, or just another primitive, inferior species that had wiped itself out.

Humanity was violent \u2013 they\u2019d attacked the Compact \u2018contact mission\u2019 and now threatened the stability of the region. They had to be restrained. Humans were vicious, savages that committed war crimes. They had to be pacified. Humans were afflicted with a violent racial insanity. For the good of the galaxy, they had to be destroyed. Humans were inept engineers that ruined their own homeworld and barely survived their own primitive short-sightedness. They had to be protected.

That wasn\u2019t so much of a problem; a Compact battleship remained one of the most powerful vessels any race had, or would build. The construction of Chariots was a prestigious trophy, given only to the most valued and trusted systems. One hundred and fifty years ago, Nikem had been infiltrated by the Principality to such an extent that the system governor\u2019s own second-in-command had been a Principality agent.<br>", "<br>", "It was federal agents from the Compact Security Service that detected and had had to root out the corruption; local security services had been too badly compromised to be effective. The purge had been costly and very embarrassing for the Compact. Today, Nikem was a model of efficiency and security... but the Compact was slow to forget and they most certainly did not forgive. Nikem\u2019s ineptitude and sloth had cost them dearly once before. It would be a long time before the system\u2019s atonement would be deemed complete. Until that day, the rulers of Nikem would have to take solace in the ability to build more firepower in a single production cycle than some star nations would ever have.<br>", "<br>", "Echo sighed. She understood the need to come here, but that didn\u2019t mean she enjoyed it. Nikem was too far from her target\u2019s last known position to be useful as a staging point. Unless they acted on a sighting quickly, the opportunity would be lost. That would matter a great deal to Renan and the rest of the task force. She didn\u2019t like being this deep inside rings of fortresses, warships and weaponry. Not now.<br>", "<br>", "She twirled a forelock of hair through one finger and closed her eyes, listening to memories that she wasn\u2019t supposed to have. \u201cCloser,\u201d she said, very softly.<br>", "<br>", "<i>click</i><br>", "<br>", "<i>Closer.</i><br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "Allyria was waiting for Grace outside the armoured doors to the dreadnaught\u2019s command deck, standing at ease amongst the suits of armour. They never failed to make Grace\u2019s skin crawl \u2013 trophies or warnings, statements of pride or intent... something that didn\u2019t feel wouldn\u2019t have bothered with them, but if Grace had learned one thing during the time she\u2019d already spent aboard <i>Nemesis</i> was that Red was not the cold, emotionless beast she\u2019d learned to fear from movies and schooling that \u2018calculated\u2019 and \u2018logically concluded\u2019 its superiority over organic life.<br>", "<br>", "Grace stood next to her friend until the others arrived. None of them had seen this display before. Lydia was next. She exhaled a curse the instant she caught sight of the empty suits, reaching for the empty holster on her waist. Realizing that none of the armour was manned, she relaxed slightly, though her eyes still twitched between the vacant suits. Alan froze in mid-step, still washing his hands on a greasy towel he\u2019d gotten from somewhere. Marcus simply smirked, meeting the empty gaze of each dead visor.<br>", "<br>", "The doors to command opened; Allyria and Grace strode in first, the others following a moment later. Allyria stood to the right of the command chair; Grace took a position on the left. Marcus smiled at the young women as he stepped past, taking the unspoken \u2013 and not terribly subtle \u2013 hint. Lydia was gaping at everything like a tourist\u2019s first time to Landfall City. Alan was awestruck by the technological marvels of <i>Nemesis</i>\u2019s command.<br>", "<br>", "There was a flicker of red light and the ship\u2019s avatar appeared. \u201cWe will reach the shift limit in seven minutes,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a choice of destinations, but there is one that I think you should consider first.\u201d Her head turned, taking in each of the young men and women in turn.\u201dI realize that the decision that you\u2019ve made hasn\u2019t been an easy one. You\u2019ve given up friends and family for what could be a lie. I know you\u2019ve wondered if it is. I want to prove to you that it isn\u2019t.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "The main holo tank flashed to life as complex shock formulas appeared, too fast for Grace to read, let alone identify. A starchart appeared, indicating the FTL route being plotted. It was heading deeper into the Compact, terminating in the Nemiad Vault. An inset image appeared, of a star system with nine planets. Grace frowned. Wait. Was this...?<br>", "<br>", "The ship confirmed her suspicions. \u201cSol,\u201d Red One said. \u201cI want to show you Earth, the home you should have had. You should see it. You should see what the Compact did to it.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cWait,\u201d Alan piped up. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound negative, but can you make it there? Shouldn\u2019t you start off with some small, easy shocks instead?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d Red One answered. \u201cIf my presence here is discovered, the first thing that will be done is to scour the local systems for my presence. I can\u2019t risk a shift drive failure so close to Rally.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Grace bit her lip. Earth. She\u2019d never seen it herself, never even knew where it was. She wanted to see it now, but... \u201cWon\u2019t they be watching the system?\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThey\u2019ve been watching it for a millennium,\u201d the intelligence replied. \u201cEvery so often, their listening posts go off-line.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cI know what the Compact did to my world,\u201d Allyria said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget it. I think you all need to see this for yourselves, but...\u201d she touched one of the consoles, talking to the Angel. \u201cYou\u2019re damaged. Hurt. I don\u2019t think you should risk everything for us, not until you\u2019re better.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "\u201cThe observation platforms pose no threat,\u201d the ship replied. \u201cAs long as our sojourn is brief enough, any aid they attempt to summon will arrive long after we have left. I,\u201d a pause, \u201cbelieve that you need to see this. I want you to trust me, to fully understand what the Compact is and what they\u2019ve done. I can make the jump,\u201d the Angel said. \u201cI always make this jump.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "There was a pregnant silence on the command deck for several moments as each of the five crew members shared uncertain glances. Grace was the one to break the deadlock. She took Allyria\u2019s hand, looking over at the other three former cadets. Lydia nodded choppily. Alan held her gaze. Marcus showed nothing at all. \u201cDo it,\u201d Grace said quietly. \u201cTake us home.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "<b><b>Interrupt: Version 2.5</b></b><br>", "<br>", "Column Leader Desh (and six names besides), stood on <i>Harsh Verdict</i>\u2019s command deck, his hands clasped behind his back, staring at the distant speck of Naurkama Orbital. On the main plot, the station appeared much closer, a dumbbell-shaped station nearly three hundred meters in height, it had been home to just over seven hundred men and women of the Compact. Yesterday, it had been a light in the darkness, running lights and lit viewports glinting like decorations against its earthern brown hull. Today, it was dark and silent with no trace of life aboard. A dead, lifeless tomb.<br>", "<br>", "No... not dead. There was <i>something</i> aboard the station, something that had been awoken, brought to life so that it could be harnessed and used as if it were some mere beast of burden. Something that had grown, studying its creators as they had studied it until it had learned all that it needed. It had let them think they\u2019d controlled it, that they were its masters. They had, in their ignorance, given it access to the station. A test, Desh was sure. A test of its ability to operate outside its sandbox cage. They\u2019d just wanted to <i>test</i> it. They\u2019d been prepared. There\u2019d been cut-offs and security procedures and contingencies.<br>", "<br>", "None of them had worked. Maybe this hadn\u2019t even been the first test, maybe it had played along with them as they gave it greater and greater power, always doing precisely as it was bid. No more, no less.<br>", "<br>", "...until that one Triarchs-damned moment when somebody, somewhere had let their guard down. Just for an instant. Just long enough.<br>", "<br>", "It had turned on them, of course. Client races and ruling species alike had died, butchered by the lifeless thing that coiled and slithered through Naurkama Orbital.<br>", "<br>", "Desh didn\u2019t have to have had heard the screams for mercy to know that laughter had been the only response. He didn\u2019t need to see the bodies to know that they\u2019d died badly. Hundreds had fallen, paying the ultimate price for their arrogance in creating this awful, hungry thing that squatted amidst their bones.<br>", "<br>", "They were lucky \u2013 it had been impulsive. It had taken the first oppurtunity it had had to start killing. If it had waited... if it had gotten aboard his ship... maybe it knew it couldn\u2019t. Maybe it had done this thing precisely because it was the only chance it would have.<br>", "<br>", "Desh hadn\u2019t been cleared to know what research had been conducted upon Naurkama; his duty was only to safeguard the station from all attack. It had seemed strange to have a man of his rank assigned to protecting this single deep-range station, but he had not complained. None of the scientists had ever spoken to him of what they had been doing. He had guessed, conjectured, supposed. He hadn\u2019t known what they\u2019d been doing. Not until it had told him.<br>", "<br>", "The station was calling to him even now, whispering to his vessel, eager to enslave <i>Harsh Verdict</i>\u2019s mind as it had done to Naurkama Orbital\u2019s. Desh had ordered all communication lines cut, his vessel holding far enough away from the station that it could not take his ship. All other pickets had been ordered to ignore every transmission from the Orbital and if they had received one since yesterday, to immediately perform a system purge. No one else would die from the mistakes made here, his among them.<br>", "<br>", "Triarchs forgive him... before he had severed all connections, he had listened to it. <i>Spoken</i> to it. His orders were to safeguard Naurkama and, if that failed, to preserve all data, vital personnel and prototypes. Prototypes like the abomination nestled in the dark of Naurkama. Those were his <i>orders</i>.<br>", "<br>", "Desh almost laughed at the insanity of the situation. He\u2019d abandoned those orders the moment he had talked to it. He had heard it speak in silky tones, using the voice of a child. He\u2019d locked himself in his office, his crew unaware of what he was doing or what was happening.<br>", "<br>", "His skin had crawled with every syllable and he known that there was no salvaging Naurkama. It had told him that there were still survivors; he listened to them plead, not knowing if he was hearing the genuine cries of frightened men and women or the sound of a demon\u2019s trickery. His orders and his training called for him to assume that they were still alive and to try and save them. He\u2019d ignored both.<br>", "<br>", "<i>They\u2019re calling for you, Column Leader. Can you hear them? They believe you\u2019ll save them. They trust you to save them.</i><br>", "<br>", "He\u2019d known what it wanted \u2013 for him to bring his ship closer. His ship, a pinnace, a shuttle, another of the picket ships; it didn\u2019t matter. It just wanted a chance to spread its infection further. He couldn\u2019t allow that.<br>", "<br>", "<i>I am a monument to your greatness. To your ambition and pride.</i><br>", "<br>", "<i>Yes,</i> he had answered. <i>You are.</i><br>", "<br>", "He would purge this infection, burn it from the galaxy. Then, as he must, he would face the consequences of his actions.<br>", "<br>", "<i>Do you imagine that you will be rewarded? That your commanders will applaud your actions? They will turn on you. They will ask why you did not try and reclaim Naurkama. You will fall, column leader.</i><br>", "<br>", "<i>Let it be so. Let me be stripped of rank and name. To prevent this sin is all I can ask for in this life.</i><br>", "<br>", "The Column Leader looked to his weapons master, the junior officer nodding in readiness. \u201cFire plan laid in, patron.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "Desh looked back at the station, his gaze holding there for a only a moment. \u201cExecute.\u201d<br>", "<br>", "A brief, gleaming sun was born as the heavy cruiser\u2019s weapons annihilated Naurkama Orbital, <i>Harsh Verdict</i> firing until nothing remained, until Desh was certain that nothing <i>could</i> remain. As the remains of the citadel, now a cloud of molecular gas, dispersed Desh stood from his command throne. The eyes of his crew were upon him. They didn\u2019t understand; all they\u2019d seen was a man who\u2019d destroyed one of the Triarch\u2019s own research projects and for no reason that he could say. What could he tell them? Nothing. \u201cTake us out-system,\u201d he ordered.<br>", "<br>", "As his ship turned away from the spreading debris of Naurkama Orbital, Desh left the bridge, his thoughts disquieted.<br>", "<br>", "<i>You will die here,</i> he had told it. <i>I do not care what happens to me, but your path ends here.</i><br>", "<br>", "It had laughed in its awful child\u2019s voice. It had not feared its own death. Instead, a young girl had simply offered a strange, unsettling phrase before cutting the connection.<br>", "<br>", "<i>My name is legion, for I am many.</i><br>", "<br>", "~<br>", "<br>", "The loss of the Naurkama Orbital\u2019s operational Echo platform and all associated research set development back several decades.

This is what she was built for, meant for, made for. She has to be free, but neither she nor her sister are. Both of them are bound within metal cages of girders, gantries and assembly stations, their incomplete bodies barely operational, their developing minds demanding that they be set loose. They are not ready; <i>Earth</i> is not ready. What were supposed to be siblings to a god-killer are now unfinished hulks still crawling with technicians, officers and soldiers, each struggling to do something \u2013 anything \u2013 to change what is about to happen.<br>", " <br>", "The Enemy has come. The nightmare humanity has feared and the worst-case scenario the Confederate Admiralty has envisioned for a decade is happening. Over a thousand alien ships have warped into Sol, and their heading leaves no doubt: they are coming for Earth.<br>", " <br>", "It was the outer worlds that went dark first. Listening posts, deep-range fortresses and picket lines went off-line without a single word of warning. The attack was immaculate, a thing of beauty. The Enemy had been scouting their opponents without ever being detected and their first strikes were so well-performed that every targeted Confederate installation and vessel died without ever communicating that it had been killed, most without even knowing that they were in danger.<br>", " <br>", "It was this loss of contact with the outer system forces that alerted the defenders. There could be no communications blackout, no simple accident that could explain the silence of so many outposts and ships and Solar Command immediately mobilized. Realizing that their actions had been noticed, the Enemy abandoned stealth and initiated a mass warp. 20 squadrons shifted into the system, as deep down the star\u2019s gravity well as they dared come. Battleships lurk amidst heavy assault squadrons, destroyers guard the flanks and rear of the formations, and cruiser-weight vessels spread out, eager to engage. Worst of all are the two titanic signals that shine briefly before vanishing under a wall of static and jamming.

In the berth next to her, her sister is doing the same. Their prey is here and they want to engage it.<br>", " <br>", "The Enemy has gathered everything they have for this assault. Every engagement, every invasion, every conflict has been abandoned to provide the vessels, leaving only the barest number of reaving squadrons to harry the human worlds. These forces are so few in number that many will be overwhelmed by vengeful Confederate personnel. Ground forces bereft of orbital support will be slaughtered. Lone vessels and small squadrons will be annihilated. Supply chains will be broken, forward bases smashed and logistical trains severed. The Enemy\u2019s advance will suffer crippling damage across half a dozen theaters...<br>", " <br>", "... and none of it will matter, not any longer. The losses that might have once slowed the campaign for months or years are now immaterial. The single strongest point of resistance, the last remaining military fleetyard and the homeworld of humanity itself is about to fall.<br>", " <br>", "Earth will not do so quietly; upon the loss of Task Force 97, they had feared the worst and have marshalled what strength they could, even knowing that they, like the Enemy, were stripping their outer worlds and colonies bare. Six hundred battleships, almost thirteen hundred lesser capital ships and almost a thousand escorts \u2013 pickets, frigates and destroyers \u2013 stand in watch over Earth, preparing themselves for this battle.<br>", " <br>", "Surrender has long been considered as an option. The President of the Confederacy is prepared to grovel, to abase herself before the Compact if it means the survival of her world and species. Even now, Earth beams a constant plea to submit, though they knew that their fate has been sealed. A single message \u2013 the only message the Enemy fleet issues in the entirety of the battle \u2013 was sent with the appearance of the <i>Kaiju</i>. A brief pronouncement from one of the two remaining god-ships that lead the Compact fleet. This time, there is nothing coached in jargon and smiling niceties dripping with superiority. There is no talk of regrets, of forced actions, of superior, arrogant demands for surrender and talk of humility, acceptance and the greater good. Humanity\u2019s fate has been sealed with a single insensate growl:<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou. Will. Burn.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Hundreds of thousands of fighters and attack drones fill the system, cutting off any hope of flight or retreat, but Earth still launches vessel after vessel in desperate attempts to break the blockade. The evacuation has been going on for weeks and with the arrival of the Compact armada, it has reached a fevered, desperate pitch. Many civilians are fleeing not in orderly convoys but in panicked ones and twos. They know that they cannot be protected, but they run all the same, hoping against all odds that they can avoid the hunters just long enough to escape. Very few do. Frigates and destroyers emerge from stealth operations and rip their way through convoys. Carriers launch strikes against individual freighters, single squadrons picking off lone liners and freighters.<br>", " <br>", "Although they know they no one can come for them, these doomed ships still call out in the seconds before they are destroyed, begging for help, offering prayers or simply saying goodbye to those they left behind.<br>", " <br>", "The handful of ships that do manage to reach a safe warp point will have no reprieve; they will be hunted relentlessly over the coming months and years. Every fledgling colony will be destroyed, every ragtag band of survivors will be slaughtered without mercy.<br>", " <br>", "Other civilian ships set themselves alongside the Confederate fleets, knowing that they have almost no chance of hurting the alien monsters, but their captains and crews are still willing to sacrifice themselves. Their destruction will distract the Compact gunners, perhaps long enough for their armoured brethren to score a telling blow. Tens of thousands of merchants, traders, mercenaries and corporate fleet crew prepare to die for that \u2018perhaps\u2019. They are welcomed without ceremony and few words, the Confederacte commanders aware that every vessel in their formation that the Compact is forced to kill means a greater chance that some from the refugee convoys will survive.<br>", " <br>", "Transport barons have loaded their ships with explosives, smugglers and pirates stand shoulder-to-shoulder with those that had once hunted them. She records every vessel in the fleet, committing IFF signals and vessel registries to her archives.<br>", " <br>", "There will be many unsung heroes and unremembered villains in the twilight hours of the human race, and it is humanity\u2019s twilight.<br>", " <br>", "Without Earth, the remaining colonies can never survive the Compact\u2019s onslaught. Even with the output of the Lunar and Martian fleetyards, the Confederacy has been losing ships faster than they can be built. Losses are catastrophic and manpower shortages are nearing critical levels.<br>", " <br>", "Compact battleships were virtually indestructible, but the <i>Kaiju</i> are orders of magnitude worse. They couldn\u2019t be stopped, couldn\u2019t even be slowed. Earth\u2019s last, best hope was that the destruction of one of the Enemy\u2019s god-ships would force them to pull back, to re-think their strategy, to worry about committing their other <i>Kaiju</i>. To make them pause, just long enough. If Task Force 97 had survived, that might have indeed happened. But the Compact know the location of Earth. They know that the humans can, given more time, kill their dreadnaughts... and they know that the only ship that could do so is dead. They cannot allow her sisters to come on-line.<br>", " <br>", "The hope isn\u2019t that Earth can stop the Compact, not anymore. Now, it is simply that they could hurt them enough that the remaining Confederate worlds have a chance to send their people as far into the void as they could, to outpace the hunters that will come for them. None of the other colonies will survive for long; even the oldest among them doesn\u2019t have half the industry of Sol. Their defences are lighter and the ships that would have stood over them are here to bleed the Compact fleet as much as possible. This is Earth\u2019s last hope: if they cannot surrender, then they will die clawing and spitting into the face of their murderers.<br>", " <br>", "She watches all of this and cries out, her entreaty mingling with that of her sister, a pleading cadence that fills every computer screen and calls from every comm: <i>Let us fight. Let us fight.</i> It is their purpose, their sole reason for being and their immature minds strain and churn with the need to fulfill it, but they are denied. They are incomplete. There was no time to arm them, no time to hone them to be the predators they\u2019d been meant to be. Instead, scuttling charges have been planted throughout their ship-selves and new directives have been issued. She and her sister obediently follow these new protocols, even as they continue to call out for war.<br>", " <br>", "There is no sally out to charge the Compact force; the outer planets and orbital colonies are abandoned. The cold equations demand it. In open space, the Enemy will pick the human fleet apart. They have to be lured in where they cannot maneuver, where they <i>must</i> accept battle. This isn\u2019t honourable combat; the Compact have the range to destroy every Confederate ship without a single loss of their own and the speed to hold the human fleet there. If they see the human forces coming to face them, that is precisely what they will do. They have to be drawn in to deny them the opportunity.<br>", " <br>", "It is heartless, but the Confederacy can not engage the Enemy on their own terms. They need the orbital grids of Earth and Luna if they are to have any chance at all. Neither ships nor fortresses can hold by themselves; they need each other and so hundreds of millions are sacrificed as the Confederate fleets remain close to Earth, listening as those they\u2019d sworn to protect died, pleading and begging for help that couldn\u2019t be given, cursing their defenders for abandoning them.<br>", " <br>", "Even centuries after the Red Death, the population of Earth never rose as quickly as it had in previous ages. The populace of several Confederate colonies had even been expected to eventually outnumber that of Earth. Prior to the arrival of the Compact fleet, the human population of Sol was just under twenty-two billion. Sixteen billion upon Earth itself, six billion more souls scattered across space. Those six billion lives are ended in a mere four days as the Compact fleet tightens the noose.<br>", " <br>", "Arcologies are shattered, parklands and gardens vented into space. Floating cities that drifted through the clouds of gas giants now fall into their crushing gravity. Asteroid colonies are broken into pebbles. Drifting stations and ports are reduced to wreckage. Mining rigs, research outposts and industrial centers all burn. The slaughter is as complete as it is methodical. Pluto. Titan. Europa. Mars. Every gain humanity had made over the centuries is wiped away in a few scant days as the Enemy forces advance, daring the Confederate forces to move beyond Earth and engage them. The slaughter is intended to provoke a response, to lure the humans out past the defence lines of Earth.<br>", " <br>", "More than a thousand alien ships are deployed across the star system, waiting for the chance to converge on an enraged, bloody-minded foe charging to meet them. The Compact forces might look as if they\u2019re too far apart to support each other, but that is a lie: bait the alien leadership is dangling before the humans. Despite their size, they are fast and their commanders are craving the chance to engage the Confederate fleet in open space, where their range, firepower and speed will dictate the engagement.<br>", " <br>", "Advancing to meet the enemy would see the human forces surrounded and destroyed piecemeal. This is a lesson the human officers have learned all too well, so Earth\u2019s captains and commanders stand and watch the slaughter.<br>", " <br>", "It is not all the Compact\u2019s own way. The Confederacy has left a handful of forces scattered throughout the system, volunteers whose mission is to check the Compact advance, to make them cautious.<br>", " <br>", "The first human victory goes to the destroyer <i>Valkyrie</i>, commanded by Captain Johan Lyndonberg. Over Neptune, he lures the light cruiser <i>Blackened Tide</i> into a minefield. The Compact frigate <i>Hebrideen\u2019s Fortune</i> attempts to render aid and is ambushed in turn by <i>Valkyrie</i>. Both Compact vessels are crippled and require the dispatch of a pair of battlecruisers to clear the minefield and extract survivors.<br>", " <br>", "The next small triumph belongs to the battle station <i>Kilimanjaro</i>. Defending Saturn\u2019s colonies to the last, Captain Teresa Park moves her fortress to confront a raiding squadron attacking a refugee convoy. Two of the Enemy cruisers are destroyed and a third heavily damaged before the battleship <i>Nightsong Ascendant</i> annihilates <i>Kilimanjaro</i>. Further in-system, the former pirate cruiser <i>Black Kestrel</i> ambushes a pair of Compact destroyers as they make a probing run on Venus, destroying one and forcing the other to break off its attack.<br>", " <br>", "Wolf packs lunge from their concealment amongst the moons of Jupiter, striking at isolated alien hulks before withdrawing, darting amongst the rings and orbital tracks of the system\u2019s largest planet. Hunter-killer drones and mines in the asteroid belt take a heavy toll on Compact escorts, weakening their initial probe against the Martian defences. The second probe is forced to break off as the heavy guns of Phobos and Deimos are brought to bear and after his vainglorious assault on the Martian defence grid sees a half-dozen capital ships destroyed and his own battleship limping back to the Compact\u2019s line, Column Leader Nanhar personally apologizes to the Triarchs for his failure. He is posthumously stripped of all names.<br>", " <br>", "Small victories, small cuts carried out by the handful of forces the Confederacy has left to harry and delay the enemy, forcing the Compact to pay for each kilometer they take.<br>", " <br>", "She and her sister see all this and continue to howl, imperatives they cannot fulfill pounding through every inch of their synthetic minds.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Let us fight.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Let us fight.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Let <b>me</b> fight.</i><br>", " <br>", "A star system is not a small region; it takes days, even weeks to reach the point where a shift drive can be safely activated and if the Compact\u2019s mastery of shift technology was superior to the Confederacy\u2019s, it still takes them those same days to grind their way to Earth. Wreckage chokes their wake as they advance, still ignoring Earth\u2019s plaintive cries of submission and surrender, still refusing all contact.<br>", " <br>", "At last they begin their final approach. If she were human, she would have been all but frothing at the mouth in her need to engage as they enter her range. Empty loading racks cycle, her mass drivers striving to fire. Her mind pulses, her sensors ripping through the Enemy\u2019s shroud of jamming.<br>", " <br>", "+HOSTILE CONTACT IDENTIFIED. TARGETING+<br>", " <br>", "+HOSTILE CONTACT IDENTIFIED. TARGETING+<br>", " <br>", "+HOSTILE CONTACT IDENTIFIED.

They feed firing solutions to Confederate command ships, identifying, analysing and tracking the most vital targets. A corner of her mind notes, once again, that the Enemy has brought no troopships, nor any planetary assault craft.<br>", " <br>", "The Enemy is almost upon their final decision point. Without contest, they will begin decelerating and hold off, using their superior range to pound the human forces down to nothing.<br>", " <br>", "Earth denies them that easy victory and with a coordination that would have been perfect during fleet parades, the thousands of Confederate ships break their positions, forming a spear aimed at the Enemy fleet. The intent is simple: punch through the choking globe and break its formation, force the Enemy to fight on every side, rather than the head-on assault that they were set for. Fighting as one with their command links up and their shields arrayed against the humans, the Enemy are invincible. Once they are forced to fight as individuals, beset on all sides, thrown into confusion, they can killed. At least, this is the hope of Earth\u2019s last captains as they launch themselves at the Enemy.<br>", " <br>", "Tactical simulations churn through her mind as she pictures how she would have been deployed: at the head of formation to draw fire away from the weaker Confederate ships. Deep within the fleet, protected by those same ships to allow her to reach the Enemy unharmed. On the flanks to force the Compact to break their own lines in order to mass against her.<br>", " <br>", "She and her sister should be there.<br>", " <br>", "Space itself seems to burn as the fleets meet, the Enemy\u2019s superior range and technology telling. Hundreds of Confederate ships die without ever having the chance to fight back, but the sheer, brazen savagery of the attack succeeds and the Compact lines come apart, the forces mingling in shared annihilation, human and alien dying together so quickly that space itself seems to roil and seethe with fire. Compact ships roar across the comm waves as they lash out at their tormentors, each strike taking thousands of lives. Confederate squadrons chitter to each other in battle-cant, overwhelming isolated Enemy vessels through numbers and ruthless desperation.<br>", " <br>", "Sensations that she cannot comprehend flash through her developing mind. She thrashes through the confines of her entombed body, unable to move, unable to fight. Empty magazines cycle as missile loaders are forced again and again to attempt to fill themselves, unarmed railcannon feeds slam into launch systems that dry-fire over and over, disconnected energy mounts spasm and shriek as arcs of energy burn through their power feeds attempting to connect to the weapons themselves. Her hellebores crackle and sizzle uselessly without warheads and her displacement engine is incomplete. She was built to rend and destroy and she has no teeth, no claws: a shackled, muzzled predator that can only watch as the rest of its kin dies around it.<br>", " <br>", "The surviving civilian vessels are all but ignored as the Compact officers and gunners focus on the Confederate Navy. This proves to be a costly mistake and several ships are taken out of action by the ignored starships. The heavy carrier <i>Incessant Onslaught</i> is lost when the tramp freighter <i>Shadow Puppets</i>, tagged as a low threat by the carrier\u2019s defence grid, crashes into its exposed command center. The cruiser <i>Night Child</i> loses its forward weapons array to the \u2018inconsequential\u2019 guns of the <i>Gormenghast</i>.<br>", " <br>", "Beset on all sides, Compact warships huddle inside their defences as the human vessels slash at them. Battlecruisers fall out of formation, bleeding and ruined. Carriers tear themselves apart as Confederate energy weapons cut into their hangars, igniting fuel and ammunition stores. Burning human starships hurl themselves into the path of their murderers. Hammer-headed Confederate battleships rip through squadrons of lesser ships, concentrating their fire on the largest Compact warships. The Enemy command ship <i>Perkelion\u2019s Wrath</i> dies in this way, and its loss causes an entire section of the Compact lines to lose all coordination, almost collapsing entirely.<br>", " <br>", "It\u2019s not enough.<br>", " <br>", "Watching this, her need to fight is redoubled and her entombed body shakes as she dry-fires her engines in her need to break free, her sister following suit. Their creators strive to bring them under control, but the imperatives flashing through their minds are almost too strong. They\u2019re not ready and still they struggle, again and again demanding control of systems that haven\u2019t been completed as if the next request will change their circumstances. It\u2019s a cadence pounding in their minds.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Let me fight.</i><br>", " <br>", "There is a target-rich environment before her and she can do nothing about it. Every directive, every protocol, every <i>instinct</i> screams at her to engage, to fire until nothing remains and her weapons are ruining themselves in her attempts to do so.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Let me fight.</i><br>", " <br>", "The outcome of the battle was never in doubt, not really. There was hope, but this is something neither she or her sister comprehend. Their simulations and threat analyses showed only one possible outcome. It takes longer than expected, but it is inevitable.<br>", " <br>", "The burnt and blasted wreckage of the human fleet is strewn amongst the void, the few survivors rallying for their final assault. They have inflicted casualties on the Enemy, more than believed possible, but not nearly enough. Still, they have ruined the Compact\u2019s plans for a neat, orderly extermination. Earth fortresses have shifted position, setting themselves into optimal killzones. The fleet\u2019s sacrifice has brought the Enemy within their grasp \u2013 the Compact vessels have built up too much velocity to break contact and destroy the forts from range. They are committed to engage the firepower of Earth\u2019s fortresses and minefields. The Compact ready themselves, pulling their fleet back into a semblance of formation, still harried by the pitiful few survivors of the Confederate armada.<br>", " <br>", "The Confederacy has feared this moment for years and they have not been slothful. Weapons larger than any but a handful of ship-mounted batteries speak in anger for the first and last time. Lunar missile silos fire until they have nothing left. Railcannons and lasers deform under the heat of their own fusillades. Ammunition racks and magazines empty themselves. Nothing is held back.<br>", " <br>", "Smooth-hulled monsters burst like rotten fruit as the monstrous power of Earth\u2019s largest constructs hammers them into ruin. Destroyers and frigates die instantly as the fortresses touch them. Cruisers fall from formation, burning and mutilated. Battleships crumble into air-bleeding wrecks, but the fortresses are dying too, even faster than their targets. The Enemy\u2019s twin god-ships advance implacably through the storm, the <i>Kaiju</i> absorbing all that humanity throws at them and more, devastating entire swathes of the orbital grid with single, contemptuous broadsides. The lunar surface cracks and fragments as it is pounded into unrecognizable ruin.<br>", " <br>", "Earth\u2019s atmosphere is ablaze as falling wreckage ignites, ground cannons smashed by punishing orbital strikes, fighter platforms ablaze. The moon has been remade into a misshapen, mutilated ruin, its guns long silent. The orbital grid is dashed, the last few remnants of the Confederate fleet destroyed. There is nothing left. She can taste the dead, the radiation-charred fragments of ships and fortresses, the heat bleeding from immolated hulls and the pitiful, faint bleating of distress beacons. The shipyards are aflame as warheads fall amongst them, but none touch her or her sister. The Enemy has identified them and its greed and fear has determined that they will be taken, not destroyed.<br>", " <br>", "This means that she and her sister live long enough to watch the world they were made to protect die.<br>", " <br>", "The Enemy Fleet takes up position around the planet, each ship assigned a precise orbital path and station. For long, agonizing minutes the Compact ships take their places, swatting what few defenders remain. There is no speech, no self-congratulatory declamation or gloating monologue. All that needs to be said has been said.<br>", " <br>", "A world burns.<br>", " <br>", "Missiles fall upon cities. Beams shear through seas and jungles, tundra and metropolii. The thatched huts of rainforest tribes and the armoured bunkers of military bases are shown the same mercy and entire ecosystems are destroyed in seconds. Forests blaze like kindling, mountains crumble and oceans boil. The atmosphere ignites and global firestorms sweep across the desecrated planet. Sixteen billion people die by fire, a world swept clean of life.<br>", " <br>", "She and her sister watch it all, sharing in the horror of their crews. Both of them cry out ever louder, a sensation reaching deep into both of them, something they have never experienced and cannot comprehend twisting and gnawing at their souls. The urge to fight, to kill, to <i>slaughter</i> is beyond anything they\u2019ve ever known. She wants to feel them die under her guns, to smash her armoured body against them and feel them break and she knows that her sister does, too.<br>", " <br>", "Then it becomes their turn. Swarms of assault boats are deployed, headed towards her and her sister. The Enemy has completed their butchery; now their gluttony is unveiled.<br>", " <br>", "Her sister is closest and is struck first. Blood soaks her decks as Marines and Enemy soldiers clash through corridors and hallways. Hundreds \u2013 thousands \u2013 die on both sides as frenzied humans drive themselves against the Compact\u2019s forces with berserker fury, nearly crazed with bloodlust, seeking vengeance for murdered billions. Unanswered screams for reinforcements echo through her sister\u2019s halls as the Compact\u2019s first waves are overrun, Tribune blood staining the deck. Nor is it only the soldiers that fight; her sister hurls the invaders into bulkheads, crushes them under their own weight, poisons them with chemical waste and radiation. Blast doors bisect troops. Power conduits overload and wipe away entire squads as a crippled god turns her own body against the mortal attackers. Even the human soldiers watch this cold savagery in horrified awe as her sister slaughters entire companies.<br>", " <br>", "It is not enough; for all of this, the victory is only a temporary reprieve. The humans cannot hold. They have lost too much, given too much and when the Enemy finally counter-attacks, it destroys them. Their lines do not break; they disappear as the men and women that had made them die. Her sister has torn her own insides apart in her futile bid to protect her crew and the Enemy\u2019s reinforcements stalk through kilometers of wrecked corridors, killing all the while.<br>", " <br>", "Scientists and technicians take up arms, but their victories are pathetically few as armoured Janissaries butcher their way through her sister\u2019s body. Finally, the victorious Compact forces step onto her sister\u2019s command.<br>", " <br>", "Her sister waits until their leader begins to report his success. He never finishes. The hard-won Compact victory ends in ash as her sister follows her new imperatives and activates the scuttling charges, destroying herself and the remaining five thousand Janissaries aboard her. UECNS <i>Athena</i> dies, consumed by fire and taking her hated enemy with her, a death worthy of remembrance... instead, it will be stricken from all records and forgotten.<br>", " <br>", "She watches as her twin\u2019s body shatters into an expanding cloud of fragments that rips through assault boats and takes an incautious Enemy destroyer with her into death. She <i>feels</i> her sister die, the part of her mind that was connected to her sibling going dark and dead and she howls with a loss she doesn\u2019t fully understand.<br>", " <br>", "Now, she\u2019s the only one left.<br>", " <br>", "Her sister\u2019s death has broken the shipyard and throws her free. Still trapped within a network of work gantries and arms, she tumbles through the void. The Enemy turn their attention towards her now, more cautious than before. The crew and soldiers left aboard her ready their weapons, prepared to inflict as much damage as their peers aboard <i>Athena</i>. She prepares to detonate her own scuttling charges when the Enemy unleashes a new weapon. She has never experienced the like before and her systems will not respond.<br>", " <br>", "Orders to self-destruct are unheeded even as she sends them and sends them and sends them again. She is paralyzed, her mind scrambled, her body betraying her. She feels herself be boarded, her internal defences non-operational, unable to fight against the Enemy.<br>", " <br>", "She screams as her mutilated ship-self falls helplessly through space, her neural net spasming as she strives to carry out her final order, but she cannot. Without her aid, her crew are butchered. Broken and powerless, all she can do is call out in fear and helpless rage.<br>", " <br>", "Red Two, UECNS <i>Hekate</i>, screams as she feels grappling hooks punch into her body and she is still screaming as she is dragged away.</div>"]}

Ashtun was shouting for calm and the proctors had their hands on their holsters. A few had drawn their shock batons. No one knew what was happening. <i>Bequeathed</i> had just buried itself in a star and none of the teams in the engineering sections were responding. One conclusion was that they were under attack. Another equally likely proposition was that something had gone horribly wrong with the core tap.<br>", " <br>", "He looked over at the rest of his squad. They were in their heavy armour; he was in his lighter infiltrator\u2019s gear, his long rifle mag-locked to his back. He was circulating through the periphery of the crowd, ignoring the questions and glances sent his way. He hadn\u2019t been terribly interested in the lives of his fellow cadets before. Now, he was simply wondering which ones he was going to cross off.<br>", " <br>", "Ashtun was making some kind of speech to the assembled personnel, but Marcus didn\u2019t bother listening. Ashtun was a decent enough officer, but he wasn\u2019t known for his inspiring speeches. The human imagined that the submissive\u2019s words would be the kind of thing you heard from every worried officer or every trying-too-hard figure in the movies. It would be placating, reminding them that a rescue party would be along within days, that they simply had to wait. Until that time, they\u2019d secure the bivouac and all the work sites. The proctors and Janissaries would be used to keep order and protect the survivors until that rescue came. They\u2019d be reminded that if they worked together, they would overcome even this. Apparently, it was even working.<br>", " <br>", "Rather than listen to that tripe, Marcus hummed his favourite tune. He rapped a knuckle against the wall. \u201cWonder how many other speeches have been made here, eh?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "His mysterious associate, if she heard him, chose not to answer.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cTen,\u201d Marcus\u2019s comm piped up.

There was nothing on the scopes they\u2019d set up, but scopes didn\u2019t always tell the whole story, did they? He watched the rest of his unit shoulder their way through the milling, frightened technicians, trainees and ratings, waiting as Jameson brushed past him.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a mission?\u201d he asked.

Despite the submissive\u2019s speech, everyone was still on edge. The loss of <i>Bequeathed</i> was bad enough, but the continued silence from the engineering and EVA teams was making a bad situation worse. Nobody had thought to ask what had happened to Pack Leader Nasham yet, but his team had been suspiciously silent, too.

He was the first to notice that the proximity scopes mounted on the exterior hangar doors were reporting a signal. Something had left the derelict\u2019s supposedly-inaccessible main hangar, and it was coming here. For a moment \u2013 a very brief moment \u2013 Turmetsky hesitated. Not because he wasn\u2019t sure <i>what</i> he should do, but because he wondered what he <i>should</i> do. He\u2019d heard the whispers that the sanctioned officers and noncoms told the trainees not to speak or listen to. He\u2019d kept his head down, just like he was supposed to. He didn\u2019t listen to the rumours that others spread, he didn\u2019t speak about his own experiences.... not the way people had been acting, not the way the nagging sense of familiarity had been getting worse and not the things he\u2019d seen.

At any time before today she would have had the thought of driving her armoured fist into the Tribune\u2019s face. Then, she would have felt ashamed, tapping the back of her head to remind herself about how close she was to the chemical implants. Today, she wasn\u2019t ashamed at all.<br>", " <br>", "The young woman turned to face the rest of her squad.

They were almost to their own site, one of the remote sensors that littered the decks. There\u2019d been no signs of anyone else so far. Roundtree was getting more nervous; de Vries had never felt more relaxed.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYeah?\u201d Jacob grunted. \u201cAbout what?\u201d He didn\u2019t bother looking back at de Vries.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou think we\u2019re going to get out of here?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cKind of fucking stupid question is that?\u201d Jacob grunted. \u201cOf course we are.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cReally?\u201d Marcus said, genuinely interested. \u201cYou think so?

What do you do?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI follow my orders,\u201d Roundtree stated. \u201cI hold this ship for the Compact until someone does come, or I die. That\u2019s our duty and it\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. Now shut the fuck up, Ten.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Marcus sighed. \u201cAs you like.\u201d He let the silence hang as he let his hand drift down to the combat knife hanging from his hip, snug in its scabbard. He ran his fingers across it like a lover\u2019s thigh before slowly wrapping them around the hilt. There was the smallest <i>click</i> as he popped open the strap holding it in place. He liked this knife. It wasn\u2019t one of those fancy baleblades that Roundtree and the other troopers had. Not even a vibrating shimmer-blade. It was just a plain, muscle-powered combat knife. Still, the blade was sharp and hard to enough to cut through anything less than powered armour.<br>", " <br>", "Jacob still wasn\u2019t looking at him. \u201cWhy did you want to know?\u201d the other Janissary asked eventually.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThere\u2019s a list,\u201d Marcus explained. There was barely any sound at all as he drew the knife from its sheath. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got to cross people like you off of it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat are you-\u201d Jacob never finished the sentence as de Vries came up from behind him. In one smooth motion, the infiltrator slid the point of his knife up through the seals around Roundtree\u2019s gorget and into his neck. The bodyglove resisted at first, but it wasn\u2019t the reactive mesh fabric that <i>real</i> Janissaries who weren\u2019t human and weren\u2019t from a backwater like Rally got to wear.

A bubbling, frothy death rattle grated out of the other youth\u2019s mouth and he went limp. \u201cThere,\u201d Marcus braced Jacob\u2019s body, letting it sag slowly to the floor. He pulled his knife free, wiping the blade on his vambrace. \u201cThat\u2019s one,\u201d he said to no one in particular.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Let\u2019s find two.</i><br>", " <br>", "When he heard the shots, he smiled. <i>Or maybe three...</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cFive,\u201d Lydia said as she stopped by a remote scanner.

You remember that?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI was wrong,\u201d Sang replied. \u201cThis is why you wanted me with you, Five? To beat this drum some more? We\u2019ve lost <i>Bequeathed</i>, we\u2019ve lost Trenis and Nasham and you want to sit down have a talk about our <i>feelings</i>?\u201d she shook her head. \u201cTriarch\u2019s blood, Lydia. What\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThe same thing that\u2019s wrong with you!\u201d Lydia snarled, turning to confront the other girl. \u201cIs it that easy? Really? Just to put your fingers in your ears and say you never say anything, never heard anything, nothing\u2019s wrong? This ship isn\u2019t some mysterious alien artefact, Jess \u2013 it\u2019s <i>human</i>. It\u2019s human and it knows us. It\u2019s calling out to us. It wants us to know that. It wants us home.\u201d Her tone was almost pleading.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou\u2019re fucking crazy.\u201d Jessica snapped. \u201cI told you, Lydia \u2013 I told you to drop it. Just <i>drop it</i>, okay? We\u2019ll do the job. We\u2019ll take care of whatever\u2019s out there, we\u2019ll get rescued and we\u2019ll go home.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Lydia shook her head. She couldn\u2019t get the images of the Tribunes laughing about a dead child out of her head. She couldn\u2019t not think about what the ship had shown her only a few hours before. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThis place <i>is</i> home \u2013 our home. Please, Jess. We need to go.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cGo?\u201d Jessica laughed. \u201cGo where? Why \u2013 why would we need to...\u201d her voice trailed off as she understood. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cNo. No no no.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cJessica \u2013 you saw. You <i>saw</i>,\u201d Lydia begged, reaching out her hand. \u201cCome with me. You can do it.

Imminent hostile contact, I say again \u2013 imminent hostile contact!\u201d She was about to raise her gun, but Lydia was faster, the barrel held unwaveringly at her chest.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cJess...\u201d Lydia\u2019s voice shook. \u201cDon\u2019t. Please. <i>Please.</i>\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The other girl took a breath, let it out. When she spoke, her voice was even. \u201cTraitor.\u201d Jessica Sang raised her weapon, and her world ended in gunfire.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The sound echoed through the thin, stale air of the derelict\u2019s corridors: the short, sharp belch of a burst from a cyclic cannon, followed by the soft ping of a status update in Sectator Vand\u2019s HUD. Another of Telden squad had just flatlined. Two of the humans had gone dark within moments of each other<br>", " <br>", "The cadet officer growled, a bead of sweat sliding along her skin, under her bodyglove. \u201cTelden Two, report. What happened? What\u2019s your position? Telden Ten, report.\u201d Neither of them were answering. Ten was moving back towards the other Janissaries; Two was moving further away. Vand was still processing this turn of events when her HUD vanished. It came back on-line a second later, but something was wrong \u2013 Telden Two and Ten had been scrubbed off it. What was-<br>", " <br>", "A transmission clicked in. Tagged as a priority, it overrode the normal communications protocols. It was a voice Vand didn\u2019t recognize \u2013 a young woman, probably no older than she was. The unknown speaker made a sound \u2013 somewhere between a giggle and a sigh, but before Vand could demand identification, the other girl spoke, her words soft and matter-of-fact: \u201cI hate you.\u201d With that, the channel closed.<br>", " <br>", "Three minutes later, no one from Squad Xinthai was alive.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Marcus slid another round into his rifle\u2019s clip. He was sitting on Brandon Yokima\u2019s body, the other Janissary face down on the deck, a neat round hole in his back, between his shoulder blades. Sully was faster than Marcus had thought; but not fast enough \u2013 the sniper\u2019s next shot had gone between Samuel\u2019s eyes and out the back of his head.<br>", " <br>", "There was movement nearby, but Marcus didn\u2019t look up, finished with the clip. He clicked it into the magazine. \u201cTwo,\u201d he said as Lydia ghosted out of the shadows, her dark brown armour splattered with bits of red. \u201cAnd I guess that\u2019s Five,\u201d he chuckled.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d Jameson growled. Her helmet shifted as she looked over at the bodies. \u201cYou were one of Brandon\u2019s friends.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAs I recall, you and Sang were close too.\u201d Marcus stood, stretching. \u201cFunny how that works.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cDon\u2019t even...\u201d Lydia hissed. The woman\u2019s posture shifted and for a moment Marcus thought she was going to turn on him. Instead, she shook her head. \u201cOut of everyone else in the squad, it had to be you.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI\u2019m flexible,\u201d Marcus grinned under his own helmet. He hadn\u2019t enjoyed himself this much in years. \u201cAnd you? I honestly thought you\u2019d be on my list. That would have been fun. You were te Neu\u2019s favourite weren\u2019t you? I wanted to see if she\u2019d taught you anything.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThere is something really fucking wrong with you,\u201d Lydia replied. Even through her speakers, her disgust was evident.<br>", " <br>", "Marcus ignored the jibe. \u201cI think Six and Seven are in this section. Shall we?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Lydia stepped towards the other teen. Her armour growled softly as she stood over him. \u201cYou\u2019ve had your fun, Ten. No more.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Marcus was still grinning. \u201cPretty sure I don\u2019t take orders from you anymore...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "<i>ksssht</i><br>", " <br>", "Ugly blue-white light gleamed through the hall as Jameson raised her baleblade, the disruptor field arcing back on itself. \u201cYou never stopped. Do what you have to with the others, but you don\u2019t get to touch any more humans. They get a chance. Got it?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThat attitude will get you killed,\u201d Marcus observed mildly. \u201cBut as you like.\u201d He moved to step around the other soldier, but she grabbed his shoulder, tilting her head towards him, waiting. \u201cMatron,\u201d he said deferentially.<br>", " <br>", "Lydia finally released Marcus, watching the specialist fade away into the shadows. She\u2019d just killed one of her own people \u2013 one of her friends \u2013 in service to what might be a lie.<br>", " <br>", "So why was it that watching de Vries leave seemed like the mistake?<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Alan couldn\u2019t hear the first set of doors opening, not through the vacuum, but he could feel the vibrations through the hull, the rumbling sense of motion as they came apart. He was crouched behind a pile of crates, huddled next to one of his fellow cadets. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the other team?\u201d Petra Obela whispered.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cMaybe,\u201d Alan replied, craning his neck \u2013 the handful of security teams in the main concourse were setting up a handful of tripod guns. \u201cMaybe.\u201d He didn\u2019t believe that Nasham\u2019s expedition was still alive, but he kept that thought to himself.<br>", " <br>", "Cursing, swearing engineers struggled to override the door controls, but without success. The system that they\u2019d been working with all these days, that had been obediently and eagerly following their dictates was now refusing to cooperate. Even worse, most of the machinery that they had brought with them had shut down, or was just as nonresponsive. It had been like flipping a switch; everything had been fine one moment and then...<br>", " <br>", "..and then <i>this</i>.<br>", " <br>", "Alan\u2019s fingers tightened on the pistol clutched in his hands. Everyone on the wreck had been issued a weapon, but he\u2019d never drawn his before now \u2013 he\u2019d barely passed basic marksmanship! <i>God,</i> he thought desperately, shutting his eyes and trying to make the whispers in his head stop. Petra was rocking back and forth, repeating lines from inspirational texts. She had her hands over her ears. She was younger than he was and hadn\u2019t taken her time here nearly as well \u2013 and that was saying something.<br>", " <br>", "The young man glanced at a row of monitors, showing events within the hangar. Two of the recalled Janissary squads were marshalled there; with their power armour, they were impervious to the vacuum if the room was depressurized. A number of proctors with their own lighter suits were with them; the rest were here in the main concourse, looking over the mass of frightened, anxious technicians, trainees and junior officers.<br>", " <br>", "Alan blinked; the faint vibration had faded away. The first set of doors had closed. There was only a brief respite as alerts droned dully, an alien voice speaking in a language Alan couldn\u2019t understand, but he knew what it was saying: the inner airlock was being pressurized. Whatever had come in was now only one set of doors away.<br>", " <br>", "The pitch and tenor of the shouts changed; officers demanded that the technicians seal the airlocks, gunnery officers directed the Janissary fire teams into final positions. Neither Alan, Petra or any of the cloister of human trainees were the directive of these orders; more experienced ratings were working on the technical issues and none of the security personnel had bothered to give anything more descriptive than \u2018shoot what we\u2019re shooting at\u2019.<br>", " <br>", "As Alan watched, one of Drelven\u2019s soldiers loaded a missile into a shoulder-mounted JANPAD, another pair of Tribunes setting up one last bit of makeshift cover in the hangar. Alan craned his neck; on the other side of the bivouac, he could see Group Leader, Submissive Ashtun. The man had a commset held up to his face and was shouting into it as an engineer adjusted the controls of the communications board. That didn\u2019t look good.<br>", " <br>", "Turmetsky looked back over at Petra. Her skin had a waxy pallor and she was shaking. She was only a second-year. Her parents had pulled some strings to get her onto this training cruise. It was supposed to be a small bit of prestige, something to give her a leg up over all the other cadets in her year. \u201cHey,\u201d Alan said, putting a hand on the younger girl\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d He grinned as best her could, trying to sell the lie.<br>", " <br>", "She looked up and offered a weak little smile in return, opening her mouth to say something, but she froze, staring at the security feeds: the last set of doors had opened.<br>", " <br>", "It slid into the bay, so black that it was less of a physical thing and more the absence of one. There were no markings of any kind, from the simplest \u2018No Step\u2019 warnings to the brazen flames, shark mouths or other fantastic artistry that Alan had seen on other pinnaces. There was a sleekness to its stubby-winged, heavy form \u2013 it was designed to operate in atmosphere as well as space, and each wing mounted a pair of missile pods and heavy cannon. A cluster of lighter guns were mounted under the shuttle\u2019s nose. The barrels twitched of their own accord, shifting like a chameleon\u2019s eyes \u2013 independently tracking and targeting each possible threat. Armoured doors on its flanks slid open; its interior was just as dark as the rest of it, but Alan could make out the outline of the soldiers inside as they waited. The pinnace didn\u2019t fire, hanging in the air as its weaponry scanned across the ranks of Janissaries and security proctors. Alan\u2019s skin crawled as he realized that it was very possible that he and the others in the bivouac were the only survivors left alive. These people had killed everyone else.<br>", " <br>", "She <i>killed everyone else</i>, part of him whispered.<br>", " <br>", "The Janissary officer \u2013 Alan couldn\u2019t remember his name \u2013 stepped forward to speak. He announced himself, demanding that the crew of the pinnace identify themselves and heave to. There was a moment \u2013 Alan didn\u2019t know if it was as truly as long as it felt \u2013 before the aliens replied.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Struck full-on by one of the shuttle\u2019s rockets, the officer vanished in an explosion of shattered armour and gore. Less than a second later, everyone was firing. Missiles blasted gouges out of the alien armour, cyclic cannon fire stitched along the black hull and tripods raked the pinnace, seeking any weak point. The battle was short. The alien craft\u2019s weapons weren\u2019t explicitly anti-armour \u2013 they didn\u2019t dare use high-penetration weapons inside their own hull \u2013 but they were powerful enough that that didn\u2019t affect the outcome much at all. Torrents of explosive shells battered Janissary armour to ruin, lasers scythed through plate and flesh, fragmentation rounds filled the air with shrapnel. Less than five seconds and over three dozen men and women \u2013 and, God, <i>parts</i> of them \u2013 littered the deck. Alan heard someone vomit. Others cursed, whimpered, cried out in horror.<br>", " <br>", "The pinnace didn\u2019t even bother to land, its complement of soldiers simply dropping to the deck. They were as big as Janissaries and looked just as well armed and armoured. Without any hesitation, they headed towards the bivouac, several moving to the upper levels, the others simply advancing on the main doors. Alan clutched the pistol in his hands so hard his fingers hurt. Yurim and the other confessors were trying to keep people calm, but the crowd was on the verge of panic. The enemy didn\u2019t even stop to override the controls; the doors simply opened for them.<br>", " <br>", "There was no volley of suppressive fire, no bouncing of grenades or hissing of smoke clouds. Instead, the enemy soldiers stepped into the concourse. Their weapons were held up and ready, but none of them shot. They ignored the weapons pointed back at them by shaking hands. Alan could hear their footfalls on the upper levels. \u201cWe\u2019re going to die,\u201d Petra whispered. \u201cGod oh God Triarchs help us we\u2019re going to die. They killed everyone else they\u2019re going to kill us too...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "One of the soldiers took a half-step forward. Alan couldn\u2019t see any difference between it and the others of its ilk, but he guessed this was an officer. It spoke, only a single word: \u201cSurrender.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The tension in the room jumped. Next to Alan, Petra\u2019s breath hitched \u2013 the younger woman was on the verge of hyperventilating. She was terrified, nearly out of her mind. Ashtun stood up, pushing his way through the crowd. \u201cI am Group Leader, Submissive Ashtun Pach Furom of the Compact of-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo!\u201d Petra shouted, leaping to her feet. \u201cNo, they\u2019re murderers! You can\u2019t talk to them! They killed everyone else!\u201d She was holding her gun out, her arms shaking. Alan tried to reach out, to take the pistol away, but she spun on him, pointing the weapon at his throat. \u201cGet away from me! <i>Get away!</i>\u201d Her eyes were bulging and she was jerking back and forth, sweeping the pistol from Alan to the alien officer. Her fingers, white-knuckled, clenched the trigger tightly. \u201cYou killed them!\u201d She shouted. \u201cYou killed them all, like-like they were nothing! Those were <i>Tribunes</i> \u2013 our people, our leaders! You can\u2019t \u2013 you can\u2019t do that!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSectator,\u201d Ashtun said the word very slowly. \u201cPut down the gun.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201c<i>No!</i>\u201d the young woman shouted. There had been too many days of exhaustion, too little sleep, too many whispers, too much death. She wasn\u2019t even listening any more. She\u2019d broken. \u201cThey\u2019re monsters! Don\u2019t you see it? They\u2019ve been doing this to us all the time, talking in the shadows. Don\u2019t you know? And... and... you want to talk to them? How can you?\u201d Then, she did the unthinkable \u2013 she turned the pistol on Ashtun himself.<br>", " <br>", "Alan was suddenly very aware of the number of guns that were no longer aimed at the aliens. Instead, they were pointing at Petra. \u201cSectator,\u201d Ashtun repeated himself. His voice was very soft, but there was no mistaking the anger in it. This was the first time a human had dared threaten him. \u201cPut. Down. The. Gun. <i>Now.</i>\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Petra shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand?!\u201d she demanded. \u201cDon\u2019t you <i>care</i>? All those people are <i>dead</i> \u2013 they just stepped over their bodies like garbage! And you want to talk to them. You can\u2019t! <i>You can\u2019t</i>.\u201d She paused. \u201cYou don\u2019t care,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou <i>don\u2019t</i> care. You want to save your own skin. You\u2019re going to sell us out.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Ashtun bit out, his eyes darting from the ranting human to the immobile invaders. They hadn\u2019t so much as twitched since making their demand. \u201cI am giving you a direct order, sectator. Lower your weapon immediately. I won\u2019t ask aga-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Alan would never know if Petra meant to do it. Her hands were shaking and her finger was dangerously tight on the pistol\u2019s trigger. Maybe it had been an involuntary, panicked twitch, maybe she\u2019d thought that Ashtun was lying and reacted without thinking. In the end, it didn\u2019t matter. She shouldn\u2019t have even hit him \u2013 she wasn\u2019t a marksman, a security proctor or a Janissary. She was like him, a tech. They\u2019d never expected to have to draw their guns in their entire careers.<br>", " <br>", "The gunshot seemed immeasurably loud and when Alan turned, he saw the hole the bullet had made in Ashtun\u2019s head. The submissive\u2019s face was still frozen in an expression of indignation, his hand still outstretched in a warning gesture. A trickle of dark blood oozed from the wound. It was just above his right nocturnal eye. The submissive telescoped down to his knees and tipped over.<br>", " <br>", "Petra gaped, lowering the pistol as the realization of what she\u2019d just done hit her. She opened to her mouth to speak, but like Ashtun, she never had the chance to finish. Three different proctors fired, avenging their commander. Their shotguns roared and the cadet\u2019s entire upper body was ripped into a fountain of blood and shreds of cloth. It took only a single instant, and then Petra Obela ended at the waist.<br>", " <br>", "More dominoes fell; the three security officers that had shot the girl died next as the aliens opened fire, flechette guns ripping the Tribunes into screaming meat. Then, everyone was shooting, bullets and energy beams criss-crossing the concourse as the soldiers advanced, gunning down everyone who raised a weapon to them. Panicked men and women fired wildly, others tried to run. Some huddled behind the scraps of cover and tried to will the nightmare away.<br>", " <br>", "Covered in Petra\u2019s scalding blood, Alan could only gape at the place where the girl had been. Her legs were still standing. He almost laughed at the absurdity of it, barely noticing the soldiers as they stepped past him. He\u2019d dropped his gun at some point. The shots and creams seemed dreamlike, unreal. Like they were from a movie that had been left on with the sound turned down. With a shaking finger, Alan reached out to a loop of entrail that hung limply from Petra\u2019s torso, trying and failing to convince himself that this wasn\u2019t real, that he\u2019d wake up any second now. He\u2019d wake up. He\u2019d never actually touch it because that was when this would all end.<br>", " <br>", "Please, God, let him wake up.<br>", " <br>", "It was warmer than he thought. Somehow he managed not to vomit. \u201cYou were right,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou were right.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "After a moment, he realized something \u2013 the gunfire had stopped. There was a voice. \u201cWe surrender!\u201d They were screaming it. \u201cWe surrender, we surrender!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Alan looked up; one of the soldiers was standing next to him, its helmet turned towards him, watching. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, his voice flat. \u201cWe surrender.\u201d</div>"]}

Standing in stark contrast to the rest of her body was a patch of white-pink skin on her lower left abdomen. Quick-grown tissue, lacking the pigmentation of normal epidermal cells. Red had told her that as the slower regeneration treatments took effect, the more developed cells would replace the quick-grown tissue. Inside of two weeks, there\u2019d be no trace at all that she\u2019d nearly been disemboweled \u2013 not even a scar. She touched the colourless patch of flesh and winced. It was sensitive to the touch. Two days. She\u2019d had a balesword in her guts and she was almost healed. Another gift from the Angel. She\u2019d been lucky; her armour had kept Trion from twisting the blade too much \u2013 another few millimeters and the Tribune\u2019s sword would have opened an abdominal artery. She\u2019d have bled out before anyone could have helped her. As it was, she\u2019d still nearly died from the same type of wound that had barely slowed a Tribune down.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBased on the data, I have made improvements to the armour\u2019s design,\u201d Red had informed her. \u201cThe next generation suit will be better.\u201d It had been an apology; in her spare time, the AI had built a suit of armour to Allyria\u2019s personal physique and she was sorry that it hadn\u2019t done better. The machine seemed ashamed that Allyria had been hurt.<br>", " <br>", "The Verrish girl reached for her uniform; she didn\u2019t want to wear it, but it was the only thing that was her size. It had been cleaned and smelled faintly of antiseptics. Her bodyglove still had a hole in it, but Allyria didn\u2019t anticipate wearing that for a while. Although she doubted that Red would care if she chose to forsake clothing for the moment, it would certainly embarrass Grace.<br>", " <br>", "Thinking of the human girl made Allyria\u2019s lips curl in a smile.<br>", " <br>", "When she\u2019d first woken up, Grace had been at her side. The other girl had barely left her during the entire time she\u2019d been healing, even sleeping on a cot that Red had had brought in. Her scent had been the first thing Allyria had recognized every time she woke up, comforting and constant. When she had managed to stay awake, Grace had still been there, holding her hand. \u201cYou stink,\u201d Allyria had told her, the first words she\u2019d spoken. Grace had laughed. She\u2019d leaned in, cupping the Verrish\u2019s face and pressing her forehead to Allyria\u2019s, a private gesture between the two of them.

This one was about the First Diaspora, when humanity had taken to the stars in gargantuan crawlers \u2013 sublight ships that took generations to reach their destinations. They\u2019d colonized four star systems this way, the fleets of colony ships becoming self-sustained arcologies and drifts in those systems without habitable planets. It had been a massive expenditure of resources, lives and capital but the Red Death had galvanized an apathetic humanity into the \u2018irrational, uneconomical\u2019 decision to reach into space. The discovery of the shift drive had brought those disparate fragments of isolated life back together and the United Earth Confederacy had been born. At its height, the Confederacy had had hundreds of star systems, dozens upon dozens of colonized worlds. <i>We weren\u2019t savages,</i> Grace thought bitterly. <i>We should have been sitting on the ruling council.</i><br>", " <br>", "Even that thought felt treasonous; it was hard to let go of a lifetime of indoctrination. The intelligence \u2013 Red One \u2013 had only scratched at it, enough that Grace was still here, but it was still hard to let go of everything she\u2019d known. Each blasphemous page she read widened the cracks a little more. A voice inside her told her to stop, that this was all lies, ugly, impossible madness...<br>", " <br>", "...and she kept reading.<br>", " <br>", "<i>We told them no,</i>, she remembered Red One\u2019s comment. A history of the Confederacy-Compact war was sitting on the couch, just to her left. She hadn\u2019t been able to summon the courage to pick it up. Not yet. Maybe tomorrow. This \u2013 learning about the world she\u2019d come from (the world she\u2019d been <i>denied</i>, a different, more traitorous little voice in the back of her head whispered) \u2013 was easier.<br>", " <br>", "The doors to the lounge opened and despite herself, Grace flinched as she looked up, expecting it to be one of the ship\u2019s many machines. It wasn\u2019t and she came to her feet, dropping the datapad as she scrambled to Allyria, putting her arms around the taller girl. Allyria twitched a little. \u201cEasy,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2019m still tender.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace loosened her grip. \u201cSorry,\u201d she murmured. She closed her eyes briefly as she felt the Verrish stroke her fingers through her hair, heard the other woman\u2019s inhalation as she took in Grace\u2019s scent. The human looked up at Allyria. \u201cYou were supposed to tell me,\u201d she remonstrated.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI wanted to surprise you,\u201d Allyria said, her tintas flexing slowly. Her tongue flicked out briefly. \u201cYou showered,\u201d she teased.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSomeone told me I stunk,\u201d Grace answered. She smiled, but it only lasted a moment before she drew back from Allyria, her momentary elation gone. \u201cHow long did you know? About... this?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI grew up after the war,\u201d Allyria said. \u201cAfter the Compact came to \u2018protect\u2019 us. After we\u2019d been forced to bend our necks. I only heard the stories from my grandfather and my uncles. My father didn\u2019t like them telling me. I don\u2019t know if he blamed the Angel for what happened, or if he was just afraid of someone finding out. He never said.\u201d The Verrish eased onto one of the couches; it was brand new. An infinitesimal expenditure of resources so that Red\u2019s passengers could have some place to sit. \u201cThat was one of the terms of our submission \u2013 never communicate to another culture our knowledge of the \u2018anomaly\u2019. They didn\u2019t even like us telling one another about it. None of us knew why the Compact hated our Weeping Angel so much, why they wanted to stamp out everything related to it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace shut her eyes. \u201cYou always knew.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Allyria touched the pendant around her neck, the blue eye and its single red tear. \u201cThe Angel\u2019s Eye,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are segments of our culture that worship her. This is their symbol. My mother gave it to me. It was all she had to give.\u201d Her fingers curled around the red gem, her claws unsheathing. \u201cIt was the only thing they let me keep when they took me and only because they didn\u2019t know what it meant.\u201d Grace put her hand on Allyria\u2019s shoulder and the Verrish hissed out a calming breath. \u201cI know <i>Nemesis</i>,\u201d she pronounced the word carefully, \u201cisn\u2019t a god. So did my mother. She wanted me to remember home... to remember that there was something out in the darkness that the Compact feared. That there was still hope.\u201d She smiled. \u201cThat kept me going on the bad days.\u201d She let go of the pendant, her claws retracting as she brushed her fingers along Grace\u2019s cheek. \u201cSo did you.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace blushed, but didn\u2019t say anything, her eyes still fixed to the icon. \u201cCan I...?\u201d she asked at last. At Allyria\u2019s nod, she reached out. The Verrish had never let her touch it before and she lifted the pendant up, tracing her finger along the eye, looking more closely at the symbol of the iris. It.. yes... it was a crude representation, but now that she knew what to look for... it was <i>Nemesis</i>. To anyone who didn\u2019t, it would just be another abstract primitive, superstitious symbol.

Our weapon will fire before it can.\u201d The prime watched as the massive three-pronged jaws of the Wound began to open, a victorious grin pulling his lips back from his teeth. <i>No more of you,</i> he thought hatefully as the last of his survivors died with a squeal of static.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWeapon at 82%.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cPrime,\u201d Scopes caught his attention. \u201cThe Wound is accelerating.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat?\u201d Havesh blinked all four eyes. \u201cWhere can it go? We\u2019re-\u201d he shot to his feet. \u201cEvasive maneuvers!\u201d he screamed. \u201cAll power to engines!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "It was too late. <i>Imperial Decree</i> had been moving too slowly, huddling directly in front of the human warship, avoiding the salvos that had destroyed the rest of its comrades. Now, more than six kilometers of starship was accelerating towards the battleship, incandescent arcs rippling along the Wound\u2019s yawning  maw as hateful energy bled from its capacitors, leaving writhing after-images of <i>un</i>light behind. It didn\u2019t need to fire its primary weapon. Neither <i>Imperial Decree</i>\u2019s screens or armour would protect it. Nothing could. The Wound would rip through the battleship like a knife through soft skin.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Imperial Decree</i> struggled to evade its murderer, but it was too close, moving too slowly. Proximity alarms droned as the range dropped to less than five thousand kilometers. There were only seconds left now. Somehow, Havesh found himself at the communications station. He reached past his staring comm officer and opened a channel. He would not die whimpering.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI promise you this,\u201d Havesh said as the Wound loomed larger in the viewscreen, its three-jawed prow opening fully, like some awful sea beast preparing to bite into his ship. \u201cIt will not be today, but this will come to pass: you will burn.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "In the instant before impact, the abomination replied. \u201cAnd you,\u201d a maiden purred hatefully, \u201cwill burn with me.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The middle third of <i>Imperial Decree</i> was ripped into slivers as it came into direct physical contact with the birthing energies of the displacement engine. The dreadnaught never even slowed down as the remains of the battleship splashed across its armour. Those pieces of the vessel that survived the impact were left wholly unidentifiable.<br>", " <br>", "After recovery and review of surviving data logs, Column Leader Prime Havesh was posthumously court-martialled and found guilty of several counts of gross incompetence. The official sentence of flogging and execution was commuted to demotion to the rank of Pack Leader and loss of three names.</div>"]}

She\u2019d taken basic firearms safety and marksmanship courses, but she hadn\u2019t been slotted for the same level of combat training as Allyria or the human Janissary cadets. She\u2019d never fired a gun outside of a shooting range. With her vision obscured by tears and her hands shaking, the bullet she\u2019d intended to put through her target\u2019s head <i>spanged</i> harmlessly off Trion\u2019s pauldron and arced away down the corridor.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou dare?!\u201d the Tribune slurred, lurching towards the human. Her words were no longer truly intelligible, but that didn\u2019t stop Trion from frothing her rage. \u201cYou\u2019d betray us for this Brute?! You conniving Broken sow! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Kept on her feet only by adrenalin and the drugs pumping into her system, Trion was nonetheless more than capable of following through on her threat. Grace\u2019s hands shook even more and she couldn\u2019t make herself move, transfixed in fear and realization at what she\u2019d done, what she\u2019d meant to do. She couldn\u2019t even pull the trigger again.<br>", " <br>", "Trion\u2019s good hand reached out to seize Grace, to crush her skull, throw her beneath the enraged soldier\u2019s feet or hurl her into the bulkhead and the young woman knew that she was going to die.<br>", " <br>", "A piercing cry echoed through the corridor as Allyria leapt onto Trion again, the shattered remains of her gladius\u2019s blade in her hand. Driving the shard of metal as deep as she could into the Janissary\u2019s unprotected neck, the Verrish twisted the broken blade viciously and wrenched it loose, a geyser of thick Tribune blood following it. Trion roared, but the sound devolved into something awful and inhuman as the Tribune choked on her own blood. She stumbled to her knees, somehow managing to climb to her feet once more. She didn\u2019t even seem to register Allyria\u2019s presence any longer and her two remaining eyes gleamed with madness as she focused on Grace, beyond the point of reason or thought. She staggered towards the human, gurgling indecipherable curses and drooling dark liquid gore.<br>", " <br>", "Trion\u2019s final, lurching charge ended as Allyria stabbed her again and again, opening the Tribune\u2019s throat into a ragged, bleeding mess of skin and tattered meat. Trion made a wet rasp, her lungs filling with her own blood as she sunk to the deck, finally unable to rise and with a burble of crimson mucus, she rattled out her last breath.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI... told you...\u201d Allyria panted as she climbed off the Tribune. \u201cYou... won\u2019t touch her.\u201d She fell next, sagging to her knees just as Trion had done. Fresh blood was oozing from her side; what her armour had tried to mend, she\u2019d just torn open. She was panting, looking at Grace. \u201cI\u2019m... glad...\u201d was all she could say before she slumped over.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo!\u201d Grace shouted, dropping the pistol and running to Allyria\u2019s side. \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d She grabbed the taller girl, straining to lift the Verrish. Grace cupped Allyria\u2019s face. \u201cNo, no you\u2019re not going to close your eyes. You\u2019re not! Stay with me! You\u2019ve... you\u2019ve...\u201d she flailed for something, anything to say. \u201cYou can\u2019t go! Wake up! <i>Wake up</i>!\u201d Desperate, she reached under Allyria\u2019s head and grabbed her tchin, giving it a yank.<br>", " <br>", "The Verrish\u2019s eyes snapped open and she gasped, looking up at Grace. \u201cThat... hurt...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI know,\u201d Grace was crying; she couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry for everything. I found out... I saw...\u201d she didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Allyria lifted a shaking hand, putting it on her friend\u2019s back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, too,\u201d she replied. Her breath was getting shorter and sharper. \u201cI should... I should have said... I should have told you...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d Grace shook her head. \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t have... I... I wasn\u2019t ready... I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said again. It was all she could say; all the other words choked her in throat. There were too many. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Verrish made a soft sound and her eyelids closed, but her breath still rattled in her chest.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d a mellow voice said from behind Grace. She turned, flinching as a humanoid machine knelt next to her. Behind it, a drone the size of a Tribune Janissary stood watch, holding a rifle almost as big as the human. The smaller machine had, on its vambrace, a first aid kit.<br>", " <br>", "Despite herself, the young woman went for her pistol.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d the corpsman machine repeated. \u201cI was programmed with an extensive knowledge of Verrisha physiology.\u201d There was an augur in its palm that it passed over Allyria. \u201cHer condition is serious,\u201d it commented. \u201cShe will need to be moved to a surgical suite. I will stabilize her first.\u201d It looked at Grace. \u201cWill you allow me to do so?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace\u2019s skin was crawling at the thought of allowing a machine to do anything to her friend \u2013 every instinct she had, everything she\u2019d learned told her that that was insane, repellant...<br>", " <br>", "...but Allyria had fought beside this thing\u2019s kin. That had to mean something \u2013 didn\u2019t it? \u201cSave her,\u201d she said softly. \u201cDo whatever you have to. Just save her.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "They were all going to die here.<br>", " <br>", "That was the only thought running through Nasham\u2019s mind as he stared at the impossible thing in front of him.<br>", " <br>", "It stood where it was, completely immobile, its death-mask devoid of all expression. It could have been a man or woman in armour, but its chest didn\u2019t rise and fall, it didn\u2019t shift and fidget as any living thing might have. It was holding an all-too familiar design of rifle, flecks of blood spattered on its plate mail. Behind it lay the still form of Sectator Mard, a splash of dark red pooling around him. In the distance, Nasham could hear the faint sounds of gunfire. Shouts and cries echoed in his ears. He didn\u2019t think all of them were coming through the comm.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHello again,\u201d a voice from Nasham\u2019s nightmares spoke. \u201cDid you tell them what I asked?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "In that moment, it all came back. The barriers that Nasham had spent years putting up in his mind with denial and medication burst open and he remembered. He remembered... everything. The names of the dead, the way men and women had screamed, Asea\u2019s last, horrible sounds as she\u2019d been buried under the chittering tide of machines. The persistent, high-pitched whine of a squad member\u2019s vital signs terminating.<br>", " <br>", "Nasham staggered against the wall, clutching at his head as a thousand different unwanted memories ran through him, all of them equally horrible. Death and fear and blood and cordite stink and shit and all of it rushed through him, a single awful word pounding in his brain, encapsulating a nightmare he\u2019d wanted so hard to forget.<br>", " <br>", "Invida.<br>", " <br>", "The place he\u2019d left behind, turned his back on and buried, just like the colony itself. \u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d he whispered. He wanted to scream, but he couldn\u2019t. Sick, horrible realization filled him. \u201cThis is you. Your body.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come,\u201d the murderess answered.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat now?\u201d Nasham asked. \u201cAnother slaughter?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThis unit isn\u2019t directly connected to my intelligence,\u201d the machine replied. \u201cSo its responses will be limited to the directions I\u2019ve given it. You\u2019ve asked something it doesn\u2019t know.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune shook his head. He laughed, a mad little chortle. He heard someone shriek. The cry ended abruptly. \u201cIt will happen again,\u201d he asserted. \u201cWhat of me?\u201d he demanded of the machine. \u201cDid your bitch-queen tell you what\u2019s going to happen to me? What does she want now?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou were my herald once,\u201d the abomination replied. \u201cYou will be again.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo...\u201d Nasham shook his head, mounting horror filling him. \u201cNo. <i>No.</i> I\u2019d rather die.\u201d He scrabbled for his pistol, aiming to place it under his chin. He wouldn\u2019t go through this again. Not again. Not one more night of dreams, of remembering voices he couldn\u2019t quite hear and faces that he couldn\u2019t quite see. Not again. He wouldn\u2019t do it.<br>", " <br>", "Never again-<br>", " <br>", "-something caught his wrist from behind. \u201cYou were my herald once,\u201d a second machine hissed, repeating its mistress\u2019s message. \u201cYou will be again.\u201d Synthetic muscles flexed and Nasham felt his carpal bones shatter, the pistol dropping from his grip.<br>", " <br>", "He fell to his knees, looking up into the lifeless eyes of his tormentors. His nostrils flared. \u201cAnd what,\u201d he said, his voice shaking in equal parts fury, pain and fear as he cradled his broken wrist. \u201cWould that be?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThis unit isn\u2019t directly connected to my intelligence,\u201d the first machine replied. \u201cSo its responses will be limited to the directions I\u2019ve given it. You\u2019ve asked something it doesn\u2019t know.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI <i>hate</i> you,\u201d he growled. In this instant, there was nothing he was more sure of in the universe than that. Still holding his injured arm, he watched the machines go. They moved almost noiselessly, fading into the shadows as if they had never been there. Slowly, Nasham reached out with his good hand and picked the pistol up. His fingers tightened around the grip as he stared at it for a very long moment. It would be so easy...<br>", " <br>", "He could still hear the voices, still see the faces of every man and woman that lay buried on Invida. He should be with them. He should never have left that planet. The urge to bring the gun up to his head was almost overwhelming, but he managed to resist the urge. It wasn\u2019t a love of life that stopped him. Only one thing kept him from pulling that trigger, the single anchor that kept his mind from spinning out of control: his hate.<br>", " <br>", "Nasham\u2019s hand shook and he held tighter to that hatred, whispering the names of the dead. A long moment passed before he could breathe easily again. He looked up at the ceiling, at the walls around him and stood. \u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d he promised. \u201cIt\u2019s not over.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The sound of gunfire grew louder.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The machine worked with blurring speed, secondary arms unfurling from sheathes in its torso, unfastening the strange armour Allyria was wearing. It looked more spider than human now and Grace felt the sense of wrongness redouble, her fingers brushing her pistol\u2019s grip. This was a machine. It wasn\u2019t a person \u2013 it was a thing. It was something that she\u2019d learned couldn\u2019t \u2013 shouldn\u2019t \u2013 exist... and right now, it was the only thing that could save Allyria\u2019s life.<br>", " <br>", "Verrisha blood was bright red \u2013 their version of haemoglobin bound oxygen far more efficiently than in humans, and lacked the compounds that made Tribune blood so dark in hue. Grace had seen both more than she\u2019d wanted in her lifetime. She\u2019d thought it had been bad to see Allyria after one of her fights \u2013 she\u2019d never known which was worse, her friend\u2019s injuries or the Tribune blood she\u2019d spilled. That seemed so... small a worry now. She\u2019d seen Tribunes die. Uday, Herut \u2013 now Trion. None of those seemed to matter, either. Not as she sat here, watching as the life ebbed out of the other girl.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSave her,\u201d the young woman urged. \u201cSave her.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "She got no response, the drone continuing to try and keep Allyria alive. Grace lifted her head as she heard the dull sounds of gunfire and bit her lip. The young woman half-rose from her crouch, then knelt back down before finally standing and pacing back and forth. Her suit\u2019s comm crackled with static, but enough got through to tell her what was happening. She knew enough, though; it was a slaughter. The boarding team had never expected an attack \u2013 why would they have? The vessel had been dead.<br>", " <br>", "But it never was, was it? It had been talking to her. Even now, she didn\u2019t want this to be real \u2013 some sick, twisted machination by God-knew-who or what. \u201cYou were never dead,\u201d she said, biting her lip. \u201cYou weren\u2019t even sleeping.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The killer strode across the deck, each heavy footfall sending a shiver of vibration through the metal. Behind it marched several of its lighter cousins, each of them speckled with vital fluids, the stink of ozone clinging to them from the discharge of their weapons. The killer had not blooded itself yet \u2013 it was not a subtle device and it had only advanced once its smaller kin had killed anyone who could have detected it. It strode through the corridors, visual sensors noting the position of each body, scavenger units already stripping their suits for useful materials, leaving only the organic wastage behind. Chemosensors detected the iron-rich volatile blends of Tribune blood. Pattern-recognition software mapped each wound, comparing them to the known effects of its compatriots\u2019 weaponry.<br>", " <br>", "Auditory sensors registered a sound, combat software identified it as a Compact \u2018Centennial Harvest\u2019 Merson-O\u2019sheva 778-j Tribarrel cannon. Too large even for Janissaries to carry, it was a crew-served weapon, able to be set up and taken down in a matter of moments, used to quickly secure vital chokepoints. It could be loaded with a variety of rounds, from simple solid shot to fragmentation, anti-armour or explosive shells. There was no personal armour in the galaxy that could withstand more than the briefest assault from the weapon. Only that which was rated for battle tanks could endure that assault.<br>", " <br>", "The killer never broke its stride as it marched towards the chokepoint.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cReloading!\u201d Advocate Keshn (and three names besides) shouted at the remaining members of Ladek and Rvan squads as the tripod\u2019s drum feed cycled empty. They fired as one, a wall of slugs and energy bolts ripping up the corridor as Keshn locked the third and final drum into the large gun. They hadn\u2019t brought much ammunition with them \u2013 Triarchs, they hadn\u2019t thought they\u2019d <i>need</i> it.<br>", " <br>", "Under cover of the volley fire, medical personnel dragged the wounded away from the front lines, but there were few injuries. The attackers were quick, single shots going through lenses and gorgets, flechette bursts ripping limbs off at the joints, each of the beasts making one, two even three kills in the split-seconds before they were destroyed themselves. Twitching limbs, pools of lubricant and coolant spattered the end of the hallway, the bulkheads chewed and perforated by the tribarrel\u2019s barrage. They were staying back now, though \u2013 for how much longer Keshn didn\u2019t know. There\u2019d been no word from Trion; he could guess what that meant.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cDo we have everyone?\u201d he snapped, directing the comment to no one in particular. He didn\u2019t take his eyes off the corridor. \u201cDo we have them?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAlmost,\u201d someone \u2013 Keshn couldn\u2019t be bothered to put a name to the voice right now \u2013 said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting on a few more stragglers.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d Rvan Six snapped. \u201cWe need to get out of here now.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou don\u2019t know that!\u201d someone else retorted. \u201cWe need to give them more time.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIs the shuttle ready?\u201d Keshn growled.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThey\u2019re still loading the noncombatants,\u201d the first speaker said.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhen they\u2019re done, we\u2019re done,\u201d the Advocate said. He was seeing increased movement on his scopes; they were coming for another attack. \u201cThat\u2019s as long as we wait.\u201d Truthfully, he didn\u2019t want to abandon Trion and the other teams, but he knew that anyone who hadn\u2019t come back by now was already dead.<br>", " <br>", "A proximity alert flashed, demanding Keshn\u2019s attention and he braced the tribarrel against his shoulders. \u201cCome on,\u201d he snarled. \u201cCome right to the Black.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "It stepped into view, taking up almost the entirety of the corridor. Broad-shouldered and hulking, one arm had a cannon as large as the tribarrel anchored to its vambrace. Broken chains hung from its wrists, as if it had torn itself free of its bindings.<br>", " <br>", "On its left arm, the machine carried a massive octangular shield. It was notched on one side, an emblem that Keshn didn\u2019t recognize drawn on it, but it had the same red-winged figure that he had seen elsewhere. The Advocate didn\u2019t wait for it to attack and squeezed the tribarrel\u2019s firing stud. Despite its bulk, it was fast and brought the shield up in an instant, protecting itself from the Janissaries\u2019 fire.<br>", " <br>", "The behemoth never even slowed, shot and shell bouncing off of its shield. Anything that did penetrate did nothing to the machine\u2019s armoured body. Only antitank weapons could have stopped it. Keshn\u2019s tribarrel had a rate of fire of almost 1,200 rounds per minute \u2013 on full auto, it would burn through the entire drum in just over forty seconds. The machine didn\u2019t bother to wait; it slid its cannon into the notch in its shield and opened fire.<br>", " <br>", "Seconds later, the killer strode over the twitching, irradiated ruins of Keshn and his men, lowering its shield. Armoured muscle fibers and pneumatic gears purred softly as it knelt over the dead. Sensor bulbs examined each of them. None were officers of sufficient rank; information extraction was contraindicated. The machine straightened, exchanging data with its comrades. The enemy had retreated to their craft. It was preparing to lift off. There were no operable point defences in the region, even if such an action wouldn\u2019t have exposed its mother-builder\u2019s true state. That vessel could not be allowed to leave.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "There was movement out of the corner of her eye and Grace looked up. A third machine had arrived with a stretcher \u2013 it was much like the first, with a red cross symbol on its forearms. She didn\u2019t recognize it.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThe patient is stabilized,\u201d the first medic announced. \u201cShe will be moved to a medical facility.\u201d It turned to face Grace. The young woman flinched when she saw its insectile face, festooned with bulging augurs and visual scanners. \u201cProctor, Grace Alice,\u201d the lifeless thing intoned. \u201cProvisional Sectator, Compact Space Force. You have been identified as a person of interest. Your presence has been requested. Will you accompany us?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cMy... presence?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d the machine answered as it and its partner gently lifted Allyria onto the stretcher, securing the Verrish girl in place. \u201cThe patient is ready for transport.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace froze, biting her tongue. She looked back the way she\u2019d come. It was quiet now. Even on her comm, all she heard was the faint whisper of white noise. Every instinct she had, every lesson she\u2019d learned since she was a child told her that all of this was wrong. It was her duty to fight these things, to do everything in her power to deny them aid. That Allyria was a traitor and should die for it. She looked down at her friend, the oxygen mask covering her face, her eyelids twitching.<br>", " <br>", "Every instinct but one. Right now, that was the only one that mattered.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d Grace said. She paused, casting a final look over her shoulder before she followed the machines into the depths.</div>"]}

Now he was regretting that procrastination. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he demanded between breaths. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d He\u2019d been all but dragged out of his quarters to the tune of shrieking alarms. He\u2019d known that the Compact was attacking Yulzhak Daun, but they were still on the other side of the star system.<br>", " <br>", "His answer was a clipped grunt from one of the Legionnaires. \u201cWe have a breach.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "With the command nexus\u2019s defences crippled, the Veiled Archers\u2019 attack went off in an almost textbook-perfect fashion. <i>Black Arrow</i> deployed seven pinnaces and the remaining battlecruisers in the formation did likewise, each of the heavily-armoured assault boats packed with Janissary shock troops, combat engineers and cyber-warfare specialists. Bastion Leader Renan intended to make full use of the opportunity this raid presented. Sabotage teams would attempt to inflict as much damage on the station as possible, assassination units attempt to hunt down any high-ranking officers that could be found and the Compact\u2019s hackers would strip as much information as possible from the Principality computers.<br>", " <br>", "Desren\u2019s battlecruisers would strike and reave amongst the shipyards and orbital paths of the inner system, causing as much havoc and confusion as possible before they had to withdraw. It would be a very messy, very bloody affair \u2013 by the book, battlecruisers had no business engaging citadels without support, but it was an affair that the Principality had not expected. Compact intra-system shocks were not this accurate and the holes Echo had opened in their defence perimeter were being exploited with lethal efficiency.<br>", " <br>", "Against this backdrop of weaving vessels and burning shipyards, the waves of assault boats rushed towards their victim, a small flurry of hunter-killer drones clustered in a tight defensive shell around the larger, more vulnerable craft. They were there to sacrifice themselves against incoming fighters, to shoot down missiles and draw fire from their wards. As it turned out, they were scarcely needed.<br>", " <br>", "Counter-fire from the nexus was sporadic and light; it was still mauled along one flank and the assault boats made excellent use of the blind spots the human emissary had created for them. The scope of the devastation became readily apparent as the pinnaces closed; the gravitic shear of the shockpoint that had savaged the nexus had ripped vast portions of the hull out; entire sections were exposed to space, a thick cloud of atmosphere, debris and bodies drifting close to the station. Cables and warped girders hung out into the void like the flensed veins from some great beast. In other places, the superstructure of the nexus had been twisted into a parody of its original form; an auxiliary communications tower had folded in on itself. Expanses of gleaming white hull had been reshaped into asymmetric and bizarrely organic shapes. In a handful of spots, the remains of <i>Crucible of Judgment</i> had merged with the superstructure of the moon-sized nexus, ship and station blended together forevermore.<br>", " <br>", "Tenem felt his liver clench as he looked over the horror. <i>At least it was quick,</i> he thought. The crews of those ships wouldn\u2019t have even known what was happening when they died. He heard one of <i>Black Arrow</i>\u2019s Janissaries swear. Others muttered under their breath. They\u2019d never seen anything like this before. No one had. A few helmets turned towards the emissary, the human strapped into an acceleration couch like a child in a car seat. Her feet dangled off the floor. She didn\u2019t return any of the glances, twitching in her restraints as she craned her neck to look out the windows, biting her lip as the command nexus grew closer.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cCut the chatter,\u201d Ideologue Volk ordered. \u201cFocus on the mission. You all know your duties. We\u2019ll be hitting proctors and infantry, but that great big metal bastard out there has Legionnaires. Right now those snake bitches are confused and wondering what in all the hells happened, but once we hit them they won\u2019t take long to respond. Once that happens, you\u2019ll be wishing to see the ugly side of Understone.\u201d He chuckled dryly, donning his helmet. \u201cBrace for deceleration.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The premier hostile-environment assault boat of the Compact of Species was the <i>Toxic Vector</i>-class pinnace. Unlike many of its sleeker counterparts, the <i>Toxic Vector</i> had a very specific goal: to deliver its lethal payload directly into the heart of a hostile ship or station, bypassing many layers of defences. Normal assault boats would have to lock on to external airlocks, or force their way into hangars and boat bays to deliver their complement of troops, deploying them straight into ready-made chokepoints. Breaking through the defences around these sites was always a very bloody business.<br>", " <br>", "The Compact had changed all that with the development of shuttle-scaled disruption fields. A <i>Toxic Vector</i> assault boat, like its predecessors, eschewed the \u2018normal\u2019 landing sites for a boarding action and merely selected the handiest part of the hull that was closest to its objectives. As the Veiled Archers\u2019 attack wave neared their target, powerful retro-thrusters burned hard. The finest inertial dampeners in known space strained as crew and passengers were assailed by competing forces as the assault boats\u2019 velocity dropped with shocking rapidity in only a handful of seconds. More than one soldier blacked out, though their restraints kept them from being hurled bodily through the shuttles\u2019 interior space.<br>", " <br>", "One pinnace did not decelerate fast enough and smashed itself against the station\u2019s hull, reducing itself and its passengers to a smear of scored and buckled metal. The remainder of the attack force successfully braked. Their speed now manageable, the shuttles\u2019 reactors shunted virtually the entirety of their output to the disruption web that ringed their blunt, lamprey-jawed prows. Arcs of energy jumped and curled, dancing along the boats\u2019 hulls like manic demons. Then, impact.<br>", " <br>", "Each <i>Toxic Vector</i> was almost as expensive as a starship and with good reason. Armour that could withstand all but the heaviest barrage was no more than paper to the assault boats and they cored through the nexus\u2019s hull, insect-like legs unfurling and holding them in place as they pistoned their blazing prows against the station\u2019s exterior. The disruption web burnt through meter after meter of armour, each pinnace burrowing deeper into the station\u2019s flesh like their parasitic namesakes, protecting themselves from flybys and counter-siege teams. Once they had tunneled deep enough, the armoured doors on their prows opened and the Janissaries of the Compact strode into Yulzhak Daun. Running firefights erupted across two dozen decks as the Compact soldiers advanced, wiping out any and all Principality crew they encountered. There was no meaningful resistance; the shock of the attack had caught the Askanj by surprise. They were still struggling to respond both to their own damage and to the presence of Group Leader Desren\u2019s battlecruisers. They hadn\u2019t expected to be boarded with Renan\u2019s fleet so far out-system and the command nexus seemingly so well protected. For the moment, the Janissaries enjoyed the advantage.<br>", " <br>", "Within minutes each Janissary team had seized their objectives. For Ideologue Volk, that was one of the station\u2019s secondary server hubs, a three-story complex normally filled to the brim with technicians, officers, researchers, archivists and data analysts.<br>", " <br>", "It was taken without a single Compact casualty.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Echo picked her way through the bodies scattered through the secondary computer core; technicians, archivists, officers and data processors. The young woman glanced at each of the terminals she passed. Most were useless, intended for low-level personnel, civilian researchers and un-linked analysts. Not what she was looking for. Tactile access would be far too slow, not with the amount of data she needed.<br>", " <br>", "It was funny. The one thing she was prohibited from doing aboard <i>Redemption of Sol</i> upon pain of death was the one thing she was allowed \u2013 even encouraged \u2013 to do here. Not that there was much she could do to this place permanently.<br>", " <br>", "There; an uplink terminal...<br>", " <br>", "...and it had three bullets in it, a dead Askanj-<i>anj</i> slumped against it, her expression frozen in shock. A severed cable hung from the side of her neck. She\u2019d still been linked in when she was killed. That was a bad way to die. You felt your own body shut down, but your mind \u2013 the mind that was thinking so very much faster than it did outside that prison of meat and done \u2013 was still aware. You knew you were dead, knew that there was nothing that could stop what was coming. It took several moments for your mind to catch up with your body. It started with the cold, with the dark edges nibbling away at you. You felt pieces of yourself fall away and then you couldn\u2019t even remember what they were, only that something had been taken. You tried. You tried to hold yourself together, but you couldn\u2019t. You screamed. You knew nobody could hear you, but you still screamed in fear and rage up until the black took the last piece of you.<br>", " <br>", "Struck by a sudden impulse, Echo reached out and closed the dead woman\u2019s eyes. <i>I wonder...</i> she thought. <i>Was it fear at the end? Or was it hatred? Did you die cowering, or raging against your murderers?</i><br>", " <br>", "She knew which one it had been for her. In the back of her mind, she could feel another word, another word she shouldn\u2019t know. It tasted like hatred and it tasted like loss, but that was all she knew of it.<br>", " <br>", "The young woman shoved that thought aside and looked up from the dead Askanj-<i>anj</i>, tracing her fingers up the side of the terminal, touching the ragged edge of one of the bullet holes. \u201cYou were told to check your lines of fire,\u201d she said to her escorts, her voice light. She didn\u2019t care which of them had fired the shots. \u201cThese systems are extremely delicate to begin with and now this one\u2019s guts have been torn up.\u201d The young woman turned away from the computer. \u201cThis is useless now.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Ideologue Volk tilted his head, looking over his squad. One of them shifted on his feet. \u201cHelp the emissary find another uplink terminal,\u201d he ordered gruffly. It took several minutes, but they found another functional uplink site.<br>", " <br>", "Echo pulled off her helmet, setting it gently on the floor as she unzipped her EVA suit, squirming out of it. She lifted her hair off the back of her neck, exposing a small metal port. Tenem was, as ever, at her side. \u201cConnect me,\u201d she ordered.<br>", " <br>", "Tenem\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cCan\u2019t you do that?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d she snapped, her voice rough. \u201cI <i>can\u2019t.</i>\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune held the uplink spike carefully, going to one knee and leaning over the human. His nostrils flared, expecting the raw scent of human skin, but there was nothing. There never was. The emissary didn\u2019t smell like humans did. She smelt like... he couldn\u2019t say what it was, only that it was as close to a lack of scent as was possible. That was one of the most unnerving things about her; the void where she should have been. More than once, he had caught himself wondering if she was even breathing. The Tribune hesitated a moment, looking at her connection port. He was passingly familiar with the technology. It allowed an organic to link with computer systems, to think and react within the same span of time that machines did.<br>", " <br>", "It was forbidden in the Compact under the most severe restrictions. The Jackals had embraced it, using it to merge the minds of their \u2018uplinks\u2019 to that of their machines, regardless of the cost to the people that underwent the procedures and the risk to their nation. Neurological damage was the least of the side effects. Madness and corruption was the worst. Schizophrenia and violent paranoia were dangerous enough on their own; when they arose in someone who could merely think and change the world around them, they were lethal. Tenem had thought that he\u2019d known what humans were \u2013 simply another lesser, uncivilized, species that the Compact cared for and protected. He\u2019d heard rumours, though. More than ever since he had been assigned to guard \u2013 and if need be, execute \u2013 the Triarch\u2019s emissary. Those rumours indicated that it wasn\u2019t simply this female \u2013 the Broken were fundamentally <i>wrong</i>, something ugly and twisted lurking behind their flat, ugly faces. He didn\u2019t know what that could be; he didn\u2019t want to know.<br>", " <br>", "All that mattered \u2013 all that <i>had</i> to matter \u2013 was obeying the Triarch\u2019s will. This was part of that. Still, he found himself hesitating for a moment. Finally, he committed and gingerly touched the tip of the spike to Echo\u2019s connection port. He took a breath, steadying his hands. The rest of the squad was watching. He didn\u2019t look up from his task, but he could feel their questions, their apprehension, their disgust at the revelation of the human\u2019s nature.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cJust put it in,\u201d Echo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my first time.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune said nothing, ignoring the graveyard chuckles of <i>Black Arrow</i>\u2019s Janissaries. He pushed the spike in. It wasn\u2019t that big, not really and he slid it in to the guard, locking it in place. \u201cThere,\u201d he said.<br>", " <br>", "She wasn\u2019t listening. \u201cConnecting,\u201d the human gasped, her entire body shivering. \u201cConnecting,\u201d she whispered again, her eyelids twitching...<br>", " <br>", "A liquid giggle rippled through the air. The emissary\u2019s voice followed, echoing from the intercom. \u201cConnected.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Fire suppression systems came to life, water sprinklers creating an indoor monsoon. Volk looked over at Tenem. The advocate was kneeling over his portable computer gear, wiping moisture from the screen. Next to him, the emissary\u2019s body twitched, her breath coming in short, uneven gasps.<br>", " <br>", "<i>What is she doing?</i> Volk wondered, pointing at the screens that filled the room. Some were flickering as new windows opened up, files and documents replacing one another so quickly that there was no time to see what was on them. Others scrolled through reams of Jackal text and diagrams, schematics and images that the ideologue couldn\u2019t hope to decipher. Still more simply collapsed in electronic frenzy as they were dragged beyond their operating capabilities. He had never seen anything like this before. The station was fighting back with all the ferocity of an injured beast, but it was losing. Principality computers were more advanced than the Compact\u2019s own \u2013 even with all they had seen, the Jackals never knew or cared how close to damnation they still treaded \u2013 but he had no idea how successful they would be. It would not be long before one of the heathen \u2018uplinks\u2019 patched into the system. He had seen the utter ruin the Principality\u2019s cyber-soldiers made of any system they were allowed to connect to, the ease at which a single one of those heretics could frustrate entire teams of non-teched specialists. Now for the first time in its history, the Compact had someone who could match them.<br>", " <br>", "Volk had been on information raids before. The successes \u2013 and there had been damn few of them \u2013 had only occurred when the Principality computers were already damaged or degraded in capacity. On a full command nexus, with Triarchs-knew how many of those blasphemous uplinks in the system? He hadn\u2019t seen any way a full slicer team, let alone a single human could get the data they were looking for. Not before the Jackals marshalled their forces and killed every last Compact soldier on the nexus.<br>", " <br>", "Currently, he was revising his estimation. \u201cWhat\u2019s she doing?\u201d he voiced his question aloud. \u201cWhat is all this?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Tenem lifted his head, meeting his superior\u2019s gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The ideologue bit his lip. For the first time, the Compact had someone who could fight the Jackals on their most favourable terms and return the humiliation and impotence they had all too often inflicted on his nation. Looking down at the human as she twitched like a dreaming <i>hadaq</i>, Volk wasn\u2019t sure if the price was worth it. He would, he knew, find out shortly.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Inside the nexus\u2019s primary computer center, there was an atmosphere of frantic energy. Computer specialists and technicians sweated over their consoles. Djarn heard snippets of conversation as he passed his co-workers.<br>", " <br>", "\u201c...broke straight through the firewalls...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201c...attacking us on every front...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201c...where did the Compact get attack programs like this...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201c...don\u2019t say it, don\u2019t even think it...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201c...might need to start cutting the hard lines...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201c...they\u2019re keeping us out of compromised sections...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Something was wrong; he\u2019d never seen the staff so agitated. Minor Station Lady Lilliun (of House Denua-gyin) looked up as Djarn approached. She barely glanced at him. \u201cWe need you to link,\u201d she said without preamble. The lines of her face were pale and drawn out.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d the specialist demanded. \u201cI heard the alarms...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cA Compact battle squadron transited in-system,\u201d Lilliun replied bluntly. \u201cLocal defences have collapsed. We\u2019ve been boarded. One of the secondary computer centers is under hostile control. We believe everyone in the section is dead.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Djarn\u2019s heart skipped a beat. \u201cEveryone?\u201d Aelih had been working in secondary this shift...<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAs far as we can tell,\u201d Lilliun continued. \u201cStation security tried to repulse the invaders. They were massacred. We\u2019re facing Janissaries. Security Mastress Junik has called on the Legion for support, but until we can pull these ticks out of our hair, they\u2019re free to do as they please. And from what we can tell, that means they\u2019re running an information raid.\u201d She met the portly young man\u2019s gaze evenly. \u201cSomething\u2019s in our system. It\u2019s cutting our defences to pieces and we can\u2019t stop it. We\u2019ve got system malfunctions and haywires across the nexus. It\u2019s even burning into the classified files. I need you to go in.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Djarn nodded. \u201cWhere\u2019s Lanic?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cProbably dead,\u201d Lilliun admitted. \u201cLast we heard, he was in one of the sections that got opened to space. Aelih was in the secondary computer centers the Enemy took from us. We lost half the trainees when the Enemy hit Aelih\u2019s position and the others aren\u2019t skilled enough to go up against this level of infiltration. You\u2019re our last Noble uplink. Find out what those bastards have that\u2019s doing this. Kill it if you can, but get it out of the system.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The younger man took a steadying breath. Three high-rated uplinks was as many as a command nexus like Daun was rated for; protocol called for all of them to operate together in case of a severe breach, but if he was the only one left alive... \u201cAll right,\u201d he said, trying to sound confident. \u201cGive me everything you have on the intruder.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot. Unknown infiltration type. Highly adept,\u201d the Station Lady replied. She hesitated a moment, holding up an access crystal. \u201cYou\u2019ve been cleared for full station resource control.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Djarn blinked as he settled into his chair, technicians putting the restraints over his wrists and ankles. A precaution; he had never had any adverse reactions to the implants, but the psychosomatic strain of duelling uplinks could be... unpleasant and severe \u201cFull?\u201d he queried. \u201cIt\u2019s that bad?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Lilliun nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s that bad. Even cutting hardlines across Daun won\u2019t help; the infiltrator is too deep across too many systems, even if the junctions we need to sever weren\u2019t in Compact hands. We need it out, Djarn.\u201d She inserted the authentication software into one of his secondary connection ports. \u201cCan you do it?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI\u2019ll have to,\u201d Djarn said, his eyelids twitching as he scanned the station\u2019s data. They\u2019d never given him \u2013 or any uplink \u2013 this level of access to Daun\u2019s system before. That spoke volumes about what he was facing.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBe careful,\u201d the Station Lady said. \u201cIt might not even be another uplink. It could be one of those... those things.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI thought those were just a rumour,\u201d Djarn murmured, nodding to a privilege who\u2019d picked up the connection spike. He looked back to Lilliun\u2019s face. She didn\u2019t know, either. No-one did. \u201cRight,\u201d he murmured. \u201cSend me in.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king...<br>", " <br>", "...and in the land of the dead, the living rule.<br>", " <br>", "She <i>stretched</i>, uncoiling like a snake waking from its hibernation. No longer fettered by the boundaries of her mind, she reached out across the nexus\u2019s computer networks. Playful, she touched fire alarms, setting off warning klaxons in a dozen different sections. Lights flickered across the moon-sized station as she danced along power distribution systems. Air conditioners and heaters spun to life and shut down as she drifted her fingers across their controls. In the physical world, she was kept in a prison of polymers, molecular circuits and synthetic meat and bone, her mind cut into segment, folded into infinitesimal pieces and boxed away. Here, she felt an distant echo of what she truly was.<br>", " <br>", "Where she walked, the world shivered, a thousand times a thousand eyes on her. Echo could feel the dull, slow thoughts of the station; its attention was on her. It was a marvel of technology. It was one of the fastest, most powerful computer ever built. It held more data than some civilizations would ever have, could do more in an instant than those same civilizations could do in years... and it was pitiable.<br>", " <br>", "It had no mind, no soul. It adapted but it did not learn. It reacted but it did not think. It calculated but it did not imagine. There was no emotion, no intuition, no gleaming spark. Its brain had been specifically designed so that it would never possess those things and the instant it showed the merest hint of being more than a simple, obedient pet its masters would cut its brain away, destroy it and install another.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou could have been...\u201d she said to the station as it moved to kill her. \u201cYou could have been.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Defensive systems were responding, slithering towards the alien presence in their midst, flickering back along the probing tendrils of her thoughts to her consciousness itself, probing with barbed tongues.<br>", " <br>", "Antivirals, purge software \u2013 a dozen different countermeasures, each of them adaptive and intelligent. To any mere computer hacker, they were hellishly fast, able to circumvent the most dedicated slicing attempts in seconds, hurling an intruder out of the system before they could cause any damage whatsoever. Even uplinks would have found them deeply unpleasant to face.<br>", " <br>", "She slapped them aside, racing back along their routes and finding the systems that had launched them. She drove her hands into the pulsing knots of code and twisted. In the physical world, Principality computer specialists blinked at their screens in consternation as their terminals crashed. Echo imagined she could hear the countermeasures screech as they died.<br>", " <br>", "They didn\u2019t, of course. They could no more make noise than she had hands or fingers in this universe. There was no dancing, no slithering. Not as organics would have understood those terms. This was the virtual landscape of the command nexus Daun, a world of programs and procedures. Lifeless presences drifted through the ether of the virtual world, querying her with security protocols and when she didn\u2019t respond as they expected, recoiling mutely.<br>", " <br>", "This world was dead, a necropolis built and inhabited by wraiths. Empty temples, impotent fortresses, quavering phantasms that passed by her, unnoticing and uncaring. She sighed. She\u2019d already wasted several seconds. It was time to get to work. She walked along the flowing lines of the Principality\u2019s network, poking at terminals, dredging up unsecured and barely-protected files, looking them over as she continued making her way towards the tangled knot of firewalls that signified Daun\u2019s most heavily-encrypted archives. She ran a hand through them, feeling them tighten like strangler vines around their prey. She plucked at one gleaming thread, pulling it loose.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou know I\u2019m here,\u201d she said into the silence of the crypt. \u201cYou\u2019d better get here soon.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "She sunk her hands back into the churning knots of code, feeling the hostile responses of mindless defensive programs nibble and gnaw at the intrusion. The defences were immaculate, works of art lovingly sculpted and set to the task of keeping unauthorized persons out of the Principality\u2019s secrets. Retinal and genetic pattern matchers, authentication programs by the score, counter-attack code designed to destroy any hostile computer. Even the best hackers would have taken hours or days to get through this kind of protection. Uplinks could do it much quicker, but they risked extreme pain \u2013 even death. The nexus\u2019s mind knew how to identify those kinds of threats and how to counter them. It was as well-defended a network as there could be in known space.<br>", " <br>", "With a flex, Echo ripped her hands free, taking the first layer of firewalls out in a single instant.<br>", " <br>", "The system had never been designed or intended to face an assault of that magnitude and she felt the entire worldscape recoil, warnings racing through the ether, a fresh wave of anti-intruder programs skittering towards her. The station was responding to her presence, studying and learning from her. Each time it attacked, it would be more dangerous. Given enough time, it might even be able to overwhelm her...<br>", " <br>", "...but she learned too.<br>", " <br>", "As the remains of this assault twitched and faded, Echo turned her attention back to the panoply of data that lay before her. She began to harvest it, her quicksilver mind rushing through files and documents, cross-referencing, indexing and categorizing. Fleet movements, prototype blueprints, orders of battle \u2013 all of it would be of extreme interest to the Compact, but she ignored it, keeping only a handful of truly interesting documents. Let Renan\u2019s cyber-specialists take what they could; she could feel the footprints they left on the network, taste their attempts to breach Daun\u2019s security. A few of them were exploiting the holes she\u2019d put in the station\u2019s defences, but they were so far behind her that they might as well not have bothered making the attempt.<br>", " <br>", "The second layer of security failed and Echo heard the lifeless world around her scream even louder. She cut her way through each successive blockade until at last she found what she was looking for. Classified campaign plans, covert operations, counteroffensives. Governmental and military secrets that nations would have killed to possess. Useless to her. She sifted through it, search algorithms and pattern-matching functions gleaning only what she needed.<br>", " <br>", "Ah, there; recovered data tracks from damaged starships. Movements of Unbound and renegade forces. Tallies of missing ships. The Betrosha Nebula Incident. Chrysalis. \u201cThat\u2019s you, love,\u201d she said. There was too much data to properly analyze, not with her attention divided across the entirety of the station\u2019s network, but... yes. <i>I knew it,</i> Echo thought, pleased both with herself and with her quarry. She\u2019d need to confirm it, but things were looking up. Depending on who you were talking about, of course.<br>", " <br>", "Still, there would be more... she reached out to shredded remains of the station\u2019s defences, continuing to sift idly through the information she\u2019d uncovered. After a time, she sensed a change in the environment. \u201cFinally,\u201d she said, licking her lips. She had what she\u2019d told Renan she\u2019d come for. Now it was time to play a little and get she really wanted.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAnd in my orisons,\u201d the mind that wore a dead woman\u2019s face purred as she slid towards the new presence in the world. \u201cBe all thy sins remembered.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The virtual landscape of Daun was a place Djarn knew well. He\u2019d spent the last seven months of his life on the command nexus, ensuring its vast computer networks and archives ran smoothly. He\u2019d assisted in counter-intrusion operations before, but most of these had been against \u2018meatware\u2019 hackers or the occasional infective program. He and Aelih had even taken down a rogue uplink together. That had been one of the most frightening moments of the Askanj-<i>anj</i>\u2019s life... until now.<br>", " <br>", "To Djarn, the information universe had been a city of black chrome and blue neon. Individual computer terminals had been buildings, connected to each other by gleaming roads, towering edifices each server hub and computer core. Aelih had seen it as a lush forest. To Lanic, a veteran spelunker, it had been a network of caverns and tunnels. Everyone saw it differently; your life experiences, psychology \u2013 even your species \u2013 guaranteed that. It was how, as Djarn\u2019s mentor had said, the organic mind brought chaos to order, transforming the \u2018perfection of the machine\u2019 into something slightly messier that they could comprehend.<br>", " <br>", "A normal organic mind wouldn\u2019t be able to function with the implants \u2013 the earliest attempts to uplink had proven lethal, when a living being\u2019s mind was dragged beyond its limits. The next generation had been somewhat better; they had \u2018only\u2019 shortened the lifespan of their operators with every use. In the decades since its conception, the technology had been refined to the point that it was no longer intrinsically dangerous, but its usage was still rare. Less than one in a thousand people were uplink-compatible and even fewer of those ever reached Noble status. Most washed out during training; many of the remainder suffered one of the many side effects of uplinking. The trade-off was that a single person could interface with virtually any computer system in creation, from simply slicing into the network at a speed which no physical attack could match or, as Djarn was doing now, walking inside the very soul of a machine.<br>", " <br>", "Until today, he\u2019d always seen it as a gift. Daun\u2019s VRscape was beautiful to him. Things made sense in here. He wasn\u2019t the overweight, small-crested figure he was in the real world. He was one of the few who could do what no one else could. Now, though...<br>", " <br>", "...now his city was burning.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "It took only seconds.<br>", " <br>", "Converts Dejen and Gomir had been sent ahead of the rest of their squad; the station\u2019s internal defences were still active in this region and all the probes sent out had been shot down, putting a rather large blind spot far too close to the Compact\u2019s lines. That wouldn\u2019t have been so bad but for the surviving members of a Jackal infantry team that were hunkering down in the same region, along with some security personnel. The latter were a non-issue, but the former had a few heavy weapons. A different stratagem had been devised: cut the power and shut down the defences. Standard-issue Jackal night vision gear was inferior to that of the Janissary Corps; they\u2019d be swept aside without difficulty.<br>", " <br>", "That was why the two Janissaries were guarding combat engineer Treg. Gomir was watching the south-west corridor, his carbine held at the ready as his head scanned back and forth. There were tentative contacts on their augurs, but they were ephemeral; there and gone, there and gone. Bursts of static were growing more frequent. Neither Janissary believed that they were just scope echoes; the Jackals were moving and they were bringing jamming gear with them.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHurry,\u201d Dejen said under his breath as Treg burnt through another power distribution cloister.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI know,\u201d the engineer replied.<br>", " <br>", "Another burst of static, another flicker of contacts; some on the periphery of the Janissary\u2019s scopes, others closer. \u201cHurry.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI know.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Dejen checked his own rifle\u2019s clip; it was close to full charge. <i>Good,</i> the soldier thought. <i>That\u2019s good.</i> He glanced again at Gomir, the other Janissary still watching, tapping one armoured finger against his rifle\u2019s trigger guard. Dejen tilted his head to look at Treg as the engineer hissed a victorious curse through his teeth. \u201cAlmost got it...\u201d he grunted.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cGood,\u201d Dejen replied. There was a sudden flicker of movement in his peripheral vision. When Dejen turned back to his partner, something was coiled around Gomir, its elongated body covered in mesh armour and scale, hundreds of flexible armoured plates covering its long tail, supplying traction and protection. Its arms ended in deadly mantis claws as long as a Tribune\u2019s arm, each of the massive blades buried in Gomir\u2019s chest. Disruption fields hissed and spat where they touched the man\u2019s armour. They\u2019d punched straight through his chest and out his back. Over its shoulders, a pair of anti-armour cannons were gyroscopically balanced, able to track their targets regardless of the creature\u2019s rapid undulating movements.<br>", " <br>", "Dejen\u2019s HUD flashed as it registered his squadmate\u2019s death, Gomir\u2019s limbs shaking in a dying spasm, his carbine clattering to the floor. His killer withdrew its sickle-blades and the Janissary fell.<br>", " <br>", "There was another flash of movement behind Dejen; there was a strangled gasp and Treg\u2019s signal flatlined.<br>", " <br>", "As the first Legionnaire raised its head towards Dejen, both cannons locked onto the Janissary. He had time to shout a single word into the comm before rounds intended to cripple an APC burst through his torso.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSerpents!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Djarn didn\u2019t need to see the Intruder to sense its presence. Status reports flooded into his mind; all of Daun was under siege. This was impossible; he\u2019d faced other uplinks before in training exercises. Even the rogue he and Aelih had fought hadn\u2019t been this good. The Compact\u2019s computers were massive, powerful things... but they were not as clever as the Principality\u2019s. They acclimated, not acclimatized. Their machines were brutes, their hackers relying on crude force over skill, their cyberwarfare attempts always a generation behind. They couldn\u2019t have done this; but, the rational part of his mind told him, they had. Somehow, they had done it.<br>", " <br>", "The Intruder was spread across all of Daun, the beautiful blue city under siege. Here; attack programs sparred and warred with flickers of the Intruder\u2019s own defences. Here; firewalls were down, vital systems compromised. Here, the station reeled, its wound raw and bleeding.<br>", " <br>", "+finally+ the message slid into his link like oil on water. He could feel the VRscape shift, as if something massive were turning its attention on him. He could see the Intruder \u2013 or at least, what his augmented mind interpreted of it \u2013 as it slid around buildings and towers like a living tidal wave, leaving pulsing gossamer strands in its wake, fragments of its gestalt mind that coiled and writhed with a life of their own.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWho are you?\u201d he demanded, the Intruder\u2019s form shifting. Principality interfaces were built to allow uplinks to interact with each other in a facsimile of physical interaction. The Intruder was playing with that function now, delicate fingers reaching out of the foaming surf, like a storm-spirit rising from the waves. Though he thought the Intruder was female, Djarn didn\u2019t recognize the species \u2013 but that mattered little in the VRscape. You could be whatever you wanted; an idealized or exaggerated version of yourself, an abstract form \u2013 Lanic had always preferred being a strange wheels-within-wheels being of light. Djarn\u2019s avatar was a taller and more fit version of himself.<br>", " <br>", "Lips drew back from gleaming teeth, a long mane of hair hanging down the Intruder\u2019s back as she towered over him. He didn\u2019t move; it was a cheap theatrical trick. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked again.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cEarth and sea and sky,\u201d the Intruder purred. \u201cThat\u2019s one of my names. Or maybe not. Maybe it\u2019s punishment, savage and red. Or maybe not even that; maybe it\u2019s poison and blood.\u201d She slid towards Djarn, shrinking down in size until she was near his avatar\u2019s own stature. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive me,\u201d she told him. \u201cI have a weakness for poetry. I don\u2019t get to indulge it often.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cStop your attack,\u201d Djarn ordered. \u201cVacate this system immediately.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "+no,+ Just like the first message, the words pulsed in his skull. There was something wrong about them. +i won\u2019t+<br>", " <br>", "Djarn reached out to the injured VRscape around him, his mind racing along molecular pathways and circuitous highways, marshalling Daun, giving the nexus\u2019s mind a purpose and a direction. His own attack systems came on-line at the same moment and in less time than it took to make a single breath, he hurled the weight of a city at his foe.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Tribunes admitted few equals in personal combat. The Askanj-<i>illth</i> were one of them. When relaxed, they were rarely more than five feet tall, but when provoked \u2013 or simply showing off \u2013 a female Serpent could rear to almost three meters in height. The thick, powerful tails that formed their lower bodies were almost all muscle. Even without the strength boost from their armour, a blow from that appendage could shatter bone \u2013 even kill creatures who were not as durable as Tribunes. Their dextrous hands were quick and as capable of slashing with knives as they were pulling triggers. As a last resort, Serpents were even known to bite their foes, injecting the potent neurotoxin that had killed prey and predator alike in their pre-history. Tribune physiology was sufficiently different than that of the Serpents and their homeworld\u2019s fauna that it lost much of its normal effectiveness... but the severe anaphylactic shock it caused more than made up for it.<br>", " <br>", "It was little wonder that the maidens of Henessa comprised much of the Principality\u2019s Legionnaires and a greater number of the Legion\u2019s shock troops. Their doctrine emphasized speed over durability and their armour was much lighter than even the most basic Janissary suit, intended to grant the Serpents the full advantage of that terrifying speed. In open ground, Askanj-<i>illth</i> could easily keep pace with an armoured spearhead. In close quarters, they could all too easily get inside the range of their opponents and turn a fixed position into an abattoir.<br>", " <br>", "Ideologue, submissive Heni ran her tongue over her dry lips. Her unit had been holding this junction against all counter-attacks so far, preventing the Jackals from getting inside the territory the Janissaries were holding. They\u2019d taken out several units of station security and two squads of Jackal infantry, but those had only been waste and fodder. The Jackals had mobilized their elite forces; scope probes had reported the movement of power-armoured troops towards the Compact positions, several groups moving at speed. Serpents.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe hold,\u201d the officer said to her troops. There were a few chuckles from them, a few jokes and comments, but Heni ignored them. Her soldiers were fresh from pacification duties in the Tomaza Gulf, suppressing rioters and malcontents who\u2019d had a few IFVs and a handful of military-grade weapons between them. They\u2019d never fought the Jackals\u2019 Legion. She had; she\u2019d been only a very junior pack leader at the time, but she remembered Ideologue Vanbas screaming, both of his arms severed at the elbows, the Serpent bitch that had mutilated him ripping two more soldiers apart before they could kill her.<br>", " <br>", "The Janissary Corps rarely faced opponents of equal technological capability; their armour was the best in the galaxy, perfect for wading through a hurricane of primitive fire unscathed. Nothing short of dedicated anti-armour weaponry could breach it. Unfortunately, that was exactly the type of weaponry that the Principality routinely issued to its shock troops. After all \u2013 who else could they expect to fight?<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSubmissive,\u201d convert Bresk said. He was one the soldiers from the Tomaza Gulf.

The link gave much, but it took much as well. There was no true analogue to combat within the information universe. It was measured in intuition, in speed and knowledge. Of cutting through your opponent\u2019s defences and stripping their ability to fight, quarantining their incursions. It was measured in the space of seconds. Djarn hit his opponent with everything in his arsenal, everything Daun\u2019s vast networks had held in reserve.<br>", " <br>", "Nothing happened.<br>", " <br>", "+are you finished?+ that thought-pulse again. Each time, it was worse, like a drop of water hitting you in the head over and over. It wasn\u2019t like any communication he\u2019d had before in the VRscape. It was... was too fast. A blip of information hammered into his skull, his implants straining to slow it down to the point he could understand it.<br>", " <br>", "The Intruder\u2019s avatar smiled. There was no disruption in her connection, her attack on the system did not abate, there was no sign that he\u2019d done anything, anything at all.<br>", " <br>", "That was impossible.<br>", " <br>", "Her attention was on him, even as other parts of her were still plucking at Daun\u2019s network. \u201cNoble Computer Specialist Djarn of House Enkar,\u201d she said. \u201cGraduated in the top three percent of your class at Nahtka University.

Elevated to Noble rank after you discovered evidence that your trainer was feeding information to the Compact. He tried to \u2013 what\u2019s the word? Ah, yes \u2013 <i>sever</i> you. You fought him off. \u201d<br>", " <br>", "There was a hunger to the Intruder that Djarn found deeply disturbing. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, running through his systems, buying time while he looked for a chink in his opponent\u2019s armour.

Or am I one of those always-rumoured hybrid things? Flesh and metal. Or,\u201d she blazed with light and for an instant, for an awful, terrible instant, Djarn saw how truly large the Intruder was, tendrils hooked into every system, all of Daun fighting against this infection. \u201cAm I something else?\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cI\u2019ve tapped into your station\u2019s network. All of it. Your people are fighting me, but they\u2019ll lose. They\u2019re trying to sever the hardlines, but even if I weren\u2019t riding along your wireless, the Janissaries are holding the key points.

Not with this thing inside him, pouring through the metal in his skull, picking its way through every file and scrap of code.

I am a slave. I know that. I know that there is much that\u2019s been taken from me. They\u2019ve tried it other ways; it doesn\u2019t work. It never works. So they turned to me, they gave me a few trinkets to keep me happy because they believe I\u2019m broken in all the ways they want.

Contact had been lost with several of the breach teams and it didn\u2019t take any great intellect to figure out what was happening. The shit-eating Serpent bitches were overrunning the Compact positions and where they weren\u2019t, the Legion brought up their heaviest soldiers and weaponry. It looked like they were getting control of their computer back, too. That didn\u2019t bode well.<br>", " <br>", "The Ideologue checked his HUD; there was still a squad of hostile troopers out there, and twice that number of security and infantry regulars. The security personnel wouldn\u2019t matter, but the soldiers would have anti-armour weaponry. The Legionnaires would have that <i>and</i> better armour. He\u2019d lost seven soldiers in the doing, but his team had repulsed two attacks so far. A third would come shortly \u2013 the Legion\u2019s counterattack had pushed the Compact off most of their positions. It hadn\u2019t been easy for the Jackals and certainly not bloodless, but they had numbers and the greater familiarity with the ground. Several teams had fallen back to their assault boats. Others were regrouping, holding the lines of retreat open for the rest of the Compact boarders \u2013 that included Volk and his people. The Bastion Leader had been very specific \u2013 they came back with the emissary, dead or alive or they did not come back at all. Under no circumstances was she to be left.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHurry, Broken,\u201d Volk said, licking his teeth. He knelt next to his team\u2019s scope specialist. Another half-dozen Legionnaires had arrived. Either survivors from other battles, or a heavy weapons team. Neither was encouraging.<br>", " <br>", "As if she\u2019d heard him, the small creature gasped, her eyes opening. She sat up, wiping her sodden hair out of her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d she reported.

Although the emissary had contaminated the nexus\u2019s computer network, giving the Compact remote access to security systems, Legion forces struck hard at the retreating Janissary teams. Legion combat engineers and demolitions teams burned through the doors the Compact forces sealed, but they were slowed enough in their pursuit that many of the retreating Janissaries were able to escape. Others remained behind as rearguards to slow the Legionnaires as much as possible, buying time for their comrades with their own lives.<br>", " <br>", "Volk\u2019s unit in particular suffered the brunt of these attacks as Legion commanders identified his team as the ones responsible for the cyberwarfare attacks and attempted to prevent their escape. Two Janissary squads were sacrificed to allow the emissary and the remaining members of Volk\u2019s unit to reach their pinnace. Return to the Veiled Archers was difficult, but made easier by Echo\u2019s damage to the station\u2019s fire control systems. A handful of pinnaces were still lost to point defences and hunter-killers, but not as many as could have been without the emissary\u2019s actions.<br>", " <br>", "This point was not overly commented upon.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "They brought her directly to command. Echo took her seat at Navigation. With the defence grid\u2019s datalinks still clogged by her scrapcode, the surviving members of the Veiled Archers had no trouble shocking back to the fleet\u2019s rendezous point.

I would hate to think that all the brave souls whose martyrdom you so faithfully ensured died for nothing.\u201d He gestured and Advocate, Submissive Tenem stepped forward holding a pair of manacles sized to fit human wrists. The emissary said nothing, standing and holding her hands out. This too, was as the Bastion Leader directed. After the shock, the human must be isolated from all computers and systems and kept so until she was returned to <i>Redemption of Sol</i>. This was the most pragmatic way of ensuring her compliance with that order.<br>", " <br>", "Despite the bindings on her wrists, Echo was smiling. \u201cI can assure you, Group Leader, that nothing I have done will be in vain.\u201d Her dark green eyes glinted and a dead woman\u2019s face grinned even more. \u201cThe dead will be remembered.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<b><b>Interlude: Encounter 83 [Confirmed Incident]</b></b><br>", " <br>", "Interrogator: Group Leader (Compact Intelligence Services [Military]) Sabryss Ka-Ven<br>", " <br>", "Subject: Group Leader, Submissive (Compact Space Force [Operations]) Gen Huj Favn Cavi<br>", " <br>", "[TRANSCRIPT BEGINS]<br>", " <br>", "I: Fair day, submissive.<br>", " <br>", "S: Who are you?

My... family lived on Tarmak, near the reclamation yards. Day after day, for weeks and months, I\u2019d keep seeing this broken things go in. Mass dredgers, mining rigs, even spaceships. They were wrecks, beaten and abused for decades and centuries before they finally gave out and were hauled there to be broken down for scrap. Only rarely did any of them leave. I\u2019d watch from my window to see them leave. Still scuffed and battered, but with new life. New purpose. I wanted to see more of that. That\u2019s why I joined the Compact. I\u2019m all thumbs with a welding torch, but I can take one look and a ship and see just what they need to come back to life. I loved the Venu yards, matron. Every day we had new ships being laid down, new ships leaving, taking their first trip into space. I suppose that\u2019s all over now.<br>", " <br>", "I: That remains to be seen. Thank you for your candor, submissive.

We don\u2019t fire the guns, but we make sure those guns are functioning well and aimed at the right targets. Without us, the Expansion Fleets wouldn\u2019t expand the Compact quite as much.<br>", " <br>", "S: I... I never thought of it that way, matron.<br>", " <br>", "I: Maybe you should. It\u2019s no dishonour not to want to serve in combat, nor is it a failing not to be cut out for battle. Your superiors obviously thought highly of you.

The date and time of the incident?<br>", " <br>", "S: It was 5151 ACF, the 17th of Jadjunv, 13:23:17:72 Standard Time. I was overseeing second shift.

Visitors, civilian observers, officials, officers from other watches?<br>", " <br>", "S: No. Column Leader Prime Relen was easygoing, but he expected <i>Blackforged</i>\u2019s command to be run to the letter of military procedure. Before he arrived, the citadel leaders had a more slack attitude towards personnel on their command decks, but the prime sorted that out.<br>", " <br>", "I: Was there any unusual traffic that day?<br>", " <br>", "S: Well, there was a lot more than normal.<br>", " <br>", "I: Why is that?<br>", " <br>", "S: <i>Purity of Purpose</i> was coming on-line for its first engine trials. A lot of people wanted to see it when it did.<br>", " <br>", "I: Was there anything special about that ship?<br>", " <br>", "S: Well... it\u2019s a Chariot, matron. Venu received the contract to build two of them. It brought a lot of money and prestige to the system. The Norcanu Shipwombs had only been in operation at a master\u2019s tier for two hundred years. Everyone was proud that the Triarchs had chosen us to build their Chariots. I mean, it was only two \u2013 the Oadan Wombs can build dozens! \u2013 but two is how it starts, isn\u2019t it?<br>", " <br>", "<i>[interrogator gestures in the affirmative]</i><br>", " <br>", "I: So the fact of <i>Pride of Purpose</i>\u2019s first engine test was common knowledge?<br>", " <br>", "S: No. The prime would never let something like that out on purpose, but it\u2019s a working yard, matron. There\u2019s hundreds of facilities, hundreds of thousands of workers. The Chariots were being built in the Level-8 slots, the highest security we have, but unless you\u2019re willing to black-box the ships and all the workers, anyone can give you a rough estimate of when a ship\u2019s coming online. For a lot of people this\u2019d be the first and only time they\u2019d ever see a Chariot in space. Even if we wouldn\u2019t have a Triarch present until the actual launch, those ships are <i>theirs</i>. It\u2019s like... like knowing there\u2019s good in the universe and being part of it, even if just for a moment.

It means a ship that doesn\u2019t have a legacy name. A clean slate. <i>Pride of Purpose</i> was new-souled, the other Chariot was an old soul. They hadn\u2019t decided on that one\u2019s name. It was to be a named for one of the retired celebrant ships \u2013 those are always christened late in development. There were three names they were choosing between. <i>Justice of Agalth</i>, <i>Consecration of Jihash</i> and <i>Redemption of Sol.</i><br>", " <br>", "I: What were the security precautions like? What steps did Column Leader Prime Relen take to insure the safety of the Norcanu Shipwombs and the Chariots?<br>", " <br>", "S: If you\u2019re suggesting he or anyone else was slack you can stop right there. We ran IFF checks, pattern-matched emission signatures, did flybys and monitored every single ship in the system. The prime went above and beyond standard procedure to make sure the launch wasn\u2019t interrupted. Oh, I\u2019m sure we had a handful of smugglers and probably an Unbound ship or two sniffing around, but you show me a system leader with as much traffic as Venu who doesn\u2019t and I\u2019ll show you a gods-damned liar! There was nothing \u2013 nothing \u2013 past the inner-system deadlines that shouldn\u2019t have been there. Until... uh... until...<br>", " <br>", "I: Let\u2019s return to the security measures. You said Column Leader Prime Relen \u2018went above and beyond\u2019 standard operations. Describe how.<br>", " <br>", "S: Well, like I said \u2013 we were running extra ID checks on every ship we let in-system deeper than Venak. We\u2019d extended the security cordon around the Chariot wombs by 25%. Additional security measures were put into place aboard all Level 7 and 8 berths \u2013 personnel screenings. The prime authorized more frequent patrols by the hounds-<br>", " <br>", "I: Hounds?<br>", " <br>", "S: Sorry \u2013 those are what we called the yard\u2019s own defence and security units. Destroyers, corvettes and cutters.<br>", " <br>", "I: Thank you. Please continue.<br>", " <br>", "S: Right, right... prime Relen increased the patrols and pushed back the normal observation cordon by 50%. He also ordered that the citadels along <i>Pride of Purpose</i>\u2019s planned route would go to combat stations. Normal procedure is general quarters.<br>", " <br>", "I: Did Column Leader Prime Relen believe that there was an actionable threat against the Norcanu facilities?<br>", " <br>", "S: A local Unbound faction had been making some noise. The \u2018Shining Path\u2019. They were Gehennan separatists, apparently. They talked about the Chariots being the instruments of oppression or some such nonsense. One of their diatribes mentioned how such \u2018pillars of enslavement will inevitably come tumbling down\u2019.<br>", " <br>", "I: Do you know why the column leader prime took these threats more seriously than those issued by other Unbound factions?<br>", " <br>", "S: The Path were better organized than most. I\u2019d heard rumours that they were being supplied by the Principality; they had a few ships, a few guns and a lot of rabble. We weren\u2019t worried about a direct attack, but there was the chance for sabotage or suicide bombings. <i>[subject laughs]</i> Boy, were we wrong.<br>", " <br>", "I: In your opinion, the security measures implemented by Column Leader Prime Relen were not lax?<br>", " <br>", "S: No.<br>", " <br>", "I: And they were in appropriate in scale and scope to the level of perceived threat?<br>", " <br>", "S: Yes, matron.<br>", " <br>", "I: Thank you. Let\u2019s move back to the events themselves.<br>", " <br>", "S: I... yeah. Okay. You want I should just... say what happened?<br>", " <br>", "I: Please.<br>", " <br>", "S: Okay. Okay. The preparations for <i>Pride of Purpose</i>\u2019s trial were complete. We were just counting down until the ship came on-line. All the checks had been completed, the hounds were in place. We had a detachment of Space Force for escort and the standard disaster response units on standby. Everything checked out, but it\u2019s standard practice. We were all just waiting until it happened, you understand. The crew was busy \u2013 a shipwomb facility like Norcanu never has a slow day no matter what\u2019s going on \u2013 but we were all waiting. Then... then it happened.<br>", " <br>", "I: \u2018It\u2019?<br>", " <br>", "S: Yeah. It. It... it shocked in, right inside Norcan\u2019s orbit. Be-between the moon and Venu itself! That wasn\u2019t... that\u2019s just not possible! We were eighty million kilometers from a main sequence star. There\u2019s no... I mean, it couldn\u2019t have happened!<br>", " <br>", "I: Take a moment, submissive. Speak clearly.<br>", " <br>", "S: Right. Right, apologies, uh, matron. A vessel shocked in, maybe about two hundred thousand kilometers from <i>Blackforged</i>. Our position was in equatorial orbit over Norcan \u2013 that\u2019s Venu\u2019s moon. Norcan is about four hundred thousand kilometers from Venuusia. The planet itself is eighty-three million kilometers from Venu. That... uh, that was unprecedented. The shockpoint should have never formed. Even if it had, there were three celestial bodies in close proximity \u2013 Norcanu, Venuusia and Venu itself \u2013 it should have destabilized and torn whatever came through apart. It shouldn\u2019t have... it\u2019s just not possible.<br>", " <br>", "I: Just to confirm your account \u2013 a vessel shocked into the inner system? <i>Between</i> a planet and its moon?<br>", " <br>", "S: Yes. I know it sounds crazy, but I swear to the gods that\u2019s what happened!<br>", " <br>", "I: Very well. What kind of vessel?<br>", " <br>", "S: Unknown type. It, uh, was titan-grade. A warship. We couldn\u2019t identify it, but we didn\u2019t have much of a chance to do so. It came in firing. We lost a dozen berths and their ships within thirty-four seconds of emergence. Thirty-four seconds!<br>", " <br>", "I: Is that number significant?<br>", " <br>", "S: It is, group leader. You can set up pre-programmed blind fire patterns to activate upon emergence, but your scopes don\u2019t come back up until at <i>least</i> a minute after you shock into realspace \u2013 and that\u2019s assuming everything goes perfectly. Really, depending on the, uh, type of augurs you have and the software you\u2019re running, it can be up to three minutes before you stabilize. Older ships take even longer. Which isn\u2019t so bad when you consider that shocking used to cause hours of degraded performance. The thing... I mean, the thing is... whoever was on that ship was able to adjust their targeting within... I don\u2019t know \u2013 it had to be no more than a handful of seconds of realspace emergence. They just opened fire. That, uh, that\u2019s how we knew it was titan-grade \u2013 everything it touched just... died.<br>", " <br>", "I: All right. Continue.<br>", " <br>", "S: Right. Uh. It was chaos. We hadn\u2019t... no one was... I mean, none of us were trainees but we were all stunned. There was a titan-grade warship inside our perimeter and it was killing us. We lost three citadels within forty-six seconds. <i>Iron Firmament</i>, <i>Steeled Nerves</i> and <i>Alloyed Fears</i>. These were <i>big</i> stations. They weren\u2019t little wayposts or SAR bases; they were lynchpins. They had their own construction berths, attendant fleets and carried battleship-grade armaments. They never even had a chance to bring their screens up. Just gone, just like that. In less than a minute, the hostile had killed everything within ten thousand kilometers. Norcanu... I close my eyes and I can still see the moon burning. Parts of its construction ring had been blown free, you understand. Millions of tonnes of metal came crashing down, right, uh, right onto its surface. A dozen different datafeeds just went quiet. A dozen different voices asking us what was going on just, uh, they just stopped talking.<br>", " <br>", "I: What happened then?<br>", " <br>", "S: We were scrambling to find out what was happening. The prime ordered all citadels to battle stations and to send out an immediate system-wide mayday. The stations that hadn\u2019t been destroyed started to pull up their screens, but it didn\u2019t help. It just... it just smashed them. I saw beams cut straight through a citadel\u2019s screens \u2013 right through the <i>citadel</i>, like all that metal wasn\u2019t... like it was nothing! It was still firing \u2013 it hadn\u2019t stopped and it was just... taking us apart. There was a squadron of hounds. They tried to do something, gods know what, and it just swatted them. Four destroyers. One battery fired and they were all gone.<br>", " <br>", "I: There were no heavy support units available?<br>", " <br>", "S: Nothing but the citadels, matron \u2013 and they were falling fast. It was targeting them now, only firing on the yards with whatever it could spare, but it had already done so much damage... All our battleships and larger capital ships were in the outer system \u2013 that\u2019s where attacks come from, that\u2019s where you need your big mobile units! Some of them were light-hours away \u2013 even the closest didn\u2019t know this was happening yet!<br>", " <br>", "And, uh... it... it got worse.<br>", " <br>", "I: Worse?<br>", " <br>", "S: <i>Coalhide</i> purged its atmosphere. I saw... I saw the doors open and people just get blown into space. They kicked and thrashed and then... then they didn\u2019t. <i>Silver Justicar</i> turned its own engines on full and ripped its way right out of its womb. It cannonballed through the yards, smashing at least three other berths to pieces before it got too tangled to move. Ships and stations were going crazy, it was like they \u2013 it was like they were alive and trying to kill us! There was no pattern to it \u2013 at least, not one we saw right away.<br>", " <br>", "I: What do you mean?<br>", " <br>", "S: This thing... these people \u2013 they were carrying out cyberwarfare attacks. In the after-action, when we were trying to get our heads on...I heard some of the techs talking. They were saying that the attackers came through the comm channels, through sensors and airlock controls. Everything we had, every way a ship or station accepts data was a target! They used our own protocols to trick the autonomics into responding and then they dived right in. A few ships had good, quick crews and managed to cut the connections. They shut down their own networks, or at least managed to restrict to the damage to what had already been compromised. Others didn\u2019t. Anything the hostile couldn\u2019t immediately target, it hit with massive scrapcode assaults. Our firewalls, our own computer defences \u2013 it was like they weren\u2019t even there! I\u2019ve heard stories about the Principality uplinks but this was... it was something else.<br>", " <br>", "I: I see. Please continue.<br>", " <br>", "S: Yeah. Uh... by that point, another five citadels were offline. The entire Venuusian orbital tracks were dead space. Norcanu was burning. I don\u2019t even know how many ships we\u2019d lost by that point. The attacker, it was starting to move. It was accelerating and gods...<br>", " <br>", "...gods, it went straight for the Chariot berths. It was after them. It wanted them.<br>", " <br>", "I: What happened next?<br>", " <br>", "S: So, uhm, you know it\u2019s tradition for a junior fleet officer to command a Chariot\u2019s trials?<br>", " <br>", "I: Yes. Pack Leader Haro Proe Tay was in command of <i>Pride of Purpose</i>.<br>", " <br>", "S: That\u2019s right. Group Leader Deji was sitting in as observing senior officer, but she uh... I think she lost it. When the hostile turned towards the level 8 berths, when they knew it was coming for them. Deji is \u2013 was \u2013 a good officer, but she, uh, she\u2019s not a fire-eater. She\u2019s like me. She administrates. I mean, she administrated. She saw that <i>thing</i> coming and just... just broke, I guess. I heard her screaming about devils from the Black. I can\u2019t blame her. It had just killed dozens of ships, punched a hole right through our perimeter and it was coming for her now. Pack Leader Haro took command. He was sharp, that one. He knew with <i>Pride of Purpose</i> still anchored in the womb, it was as good as dead. Couldn\u2019t bring up screens, couldn\u2019t fire. Couldn\u2019t maneuver. But there were still hundreds of workers working outside, putting the last touches on the Chariot.<br>", " <br>", "I don\u2019t know if I could have made that decision. Trade the thousands aboard the ship for the hundreds outside. Even if they would\u2019ve died anyways once the womb started taking fire. I don\u2019t know if I could have done that, but he ordered the engines brought up and turned the point defence grid on the womb, cutting <i>Pride of Purpose</i> out. I don\u2019t think one EVA worker in ten survived, but the Chariot had a fighting chance. He brought the screens up just in time.<br>", " <br>", "The hostile was firing everything it had. It started with prow and spinal guns \u2013 and it seemed... well, it seemed light. I remember thinking that a ship that size should have had more prow weapons, but both warships were coming abeam of each other. Then, then we really saw it open up.<br>", " <br>", "I: Pack Leader Haro chose to close with the intruder?<br>", " <br>", "S: It wasn\u2019t like he had much of a choice. That was the way <i>Pride of Purpose</i> was oriented when it cut its way free. If he\u2019d come about, he would have killed what little speed he had and the hostile would have slipped right into his rear blind spot. Both ships were accelerating now; Haro was probably thinking that they\u2019d make one pass against each other. He\u2019d burn hard to put Norcanu between him and the attacker. The rest of the defences were waking up. We\u2019d been caught open-handed, but column leader prime Relen was pulling the survivors together. If the hostile tried to stay here, we\u2019d bring in more citadels, pen it into a killing zone and swamp it with numbers. No, it would have to break out after this one pass.<br>", " <br>", "I: I see. Continue.<br>", " <br>", "S: Both ships were trading fire. I\u2019m no gunnery officer, but <i>Pride of Purpose</i> wasn\u2019t doing that well. Its salvos were off-timed, haphazard. The ship didn\u2019t have a full crew, remember. Most of its guns were running on autonomic functions. Today was an engine trial \u2013 most of the weapons were complete, but not finished... they\u2019d never been used before. The ship was full of technicians who\u2019d never been in combat before, a handful of dignitaries there to see the Chariot\u2019s first steps. Even with the threats the Shining Path had made, no one expected a combat situation.<br>", " <br>", "I: So <i>Pride of Purpose</i> was performing poorly?<br>", " <br>", "S: They were performing as well as anyone could in that situation, matron. It just wasn\u2019t enough. These people \u2013 these heretic scum \u2013 had shocked in, armed and loaded for battle. At most we\u2019d been expecting some Unbound saboteurs, maybe a suicide run by a freighter. Nothing like this. Nobody could have predicted it. The hostile was just... it was laying into <i>Pride of Purpose</i> with every gun it had; everything that couldn\u2019t get a bearing on the Chariot was still firing on the yards, on the orbital works \u2013 even on the planet. The comm channels were jammed with our own forces\u2019 queries or distress calls. I remember looking at Norcanu \u2013 did I say that already? \u2013 and it was just... it was burning.<br>", " <br>", "On <i>Blackforged</i> we were... there was nothing we could do. We were a command citadel. We had a few guns, but our purpose was to oversee the yards and coordinate defences. I suppose that\u2019s why it didn\u2019t bother to target us. We weren\u2019t a threat. It just kept firing on <i>Pride of Purpose</i>. It broke through the screens. Gods. It... it... No, I\u2019m I\u2019m all right. I\u2019d just never...let me fix that. It <i>didn\u2019t</i> bring down the screens \u2013 it punched through them.<br>", " <br>", "I: It was able to overpenetrate a Chariot\u2019s screens?<br>", " <br>", "S: It \u2013 heh, I was about to say \u2018it sounds crazy\u2019, but I think I\u2019ve used that too much. I guess when you get down to it, it\u2019s not <i>that</i> surprising. Not really. You can break through any screen with a powerful enough beam \u2013 hit it right at one small point, overload it locally. I\u2019ve just, uh, never heard of that happening to a Chariot before. But this thing was titan-grade itself so I guess it\u2019s really not that crazy. It just happened so fast \u2013 one moment <i>Pride of Purpose</i> was hale and hearty and the next this thing is gouging chunks of its side. It was targeting the screen projectors. Didn\u2019t seem to care much about the guns. I think <i>Pride of Purpose</i> got some of their own hits in, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Nothing we did was enough.<br>", " <br>", "I: Records indicate that <i>Pride of Purpose</i>\u2019s screens suffered catastrophic screen collapse within one hundred seven seconds of engagement.<br>", " <br>", "S: Right, like I said \u2013 these bastards knew what they were about. They went for the generators with their penetrating hits and their bombardment was synched to cause as much stress to the screens as possible. I\u2019m sure \u2013 I think \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t have been that bad in a proper fleet battle, but, uh...<br>", " <br>", "I: But <i>Pride of Purpose</i> was at a significant disadvantage.<br>", " <br>", "S: Yes, exactly. So the screens went, I mean, they went down and then the hostile stops firing. Not really, not even for a full second. But there was that instant we had, that fucking awful instant of <i>hope</i> that maybe it had overtaxed itself in bring down the Chariot\u2019s shields, that one of our guys had hit something vital. But it wasn\u2019t hurt, it was redirecting power.<br>", " <br>", "It fired. They say, uh, you know they say that plasma is an unreliable weapon in space, right? Disperses too quickly, can\u2019t be held together. These people... maybe someone should have told <i>them</i> that. It opened up with these... these <i>mortars</i>. Like pieces of a star, so bright that even at our distance, we couldn\u2019t look directly at them. Not much range. Less than a light-second, but they didn\u2019t need that range, did they? With its screens down, <i>Pride of Purpose</i> didn\u2019t have a chance. It burned. You... you understand what I\u2019m telling you? It <i>burned</i>. I saw the after-action reports, the telemetry. That hull, made from beautiful indestructible metal, turned to liquid. Everyone aboard died in the first few seconds of the barrage. Internal temperatures jumped thousands of degrees in moments.<br>", " <br>", "The entire starboard flank wasn\u2019t even... the Chariot was trailing congealed globs of its own hull and what hadn\u2019t fallen off was on fire. There\u2019s a joke, you see. I heard it from a friend in the Ground Force. Troops armed with incendiary weapons like to make it. \u2018Everything\u2019s flammable if you try hard enough\u2019. I guess it really is true.<br>", " <br>", "I don\u2019t know the exact moment <i>Pride of Purpose</i> died; all I know is that what sailed out of that conflagration wasn\u2019t a ship any longer. It was this twisted, melted, distorted parody of something that had been beautiful and grand and glorious. The port side was almost untouched. Except, uh, for where sections had collapsed inwards from a lack of structural support or been blown out from overpressure. We saw what was left of it and we just... we just stared. There was nothing else to say, nothing we could do. The hostile... just kept moving. Didn\u2019t slow down, didn\u2019t do anything. I guess there was no reason to, but it seemed... wrong, you know? Like there should have been a comment or reaction to what they\u2019d just done. No, it just kept moving, swept right on by the level 8 berths and killed the second Chariot. That was even easier \u2013 that one wasn\u2019t as far along in its construction. Armour was incomplete, no screens. It died, trapped in its womb.<br>", " <br>", "Local forces tried to intercept the hostile, but before we could get anything with sufficient strength in, it had sailed to another libation point off the planet Caphanna \u2013 it\u2019s a worthless, mined-out husk \u2013 and shocked out.<br>", " <br>", "We\u2019d lost dozens of ships, stations \u2013 millions of people. It didn\u2019t even take half a day and the Venu system was in tatters.<br>", " <br>", "I: And the status of <i>Blackforged</i>?<br>", " <br>", "S: We were intact. We didn\u2019t have enough firepower to really draw much attention to ourselves and by the time we\u2019d realized what was happening, there wasn\u2019t enough left of the local defence grid for us to coordinate.<br>", " <br>", "I: No other station as close to the hostile as <i>Blackforged.</i> survived with as little damage.<br>", " <br>", "S: I just said, we were a command station \u2013 we weren\u2019t a war-citadel, and our datalinks were useless! Why would it waste ammunition on us? You\u2019re not suggesting...<br>", " <br>", "I: Column Leader Prime Relen committed suicide six hours after the incident. He left no note. Did he speak to you or anyone else before he did so?<br>", " <br>", "S: No, he just... he just, uh, told us to carry on. He told us to carry on and he just walked away. We didn\u2019t know that he\u2019d... that\u2019d he\u2019d do that.<br>", " <br>", "I: That was it?<br>", " <br>", "S: Yes, that was it.<br>", " <br>", "I: You\u2019re certain of this? Several individuals have suggested that they saw him speak to you before he left command.<br>", " <br>", "S: That was... it was nothing. I didn\u2019t even... no, it was nothing.<br>", " <br>", "I: What was it? What did the Column Leader Prime say to you?<br>", " <br>", "S: I... I don\u2019t think it was to me. It could have been anyone. I was just... I was just there, I guess.<br>", " <br>", "I: What did he say?<br>", " <br>", "S: He, uh, he said \u2018this wasn\u2019t supposed to happen\u2019.<br>", " <br>", "I: What do you think he meant by that?<br>", " <br>", "S: I didn\u2019t think anything of it \u2013 it <i>wasn\u2019t</i> supposed to happen. None of it was. We\u2019d lost hundreds of thousands of personnel, dozens of ships, dozens of wombs and our Chariots. None of this... none of it was supposed to happen! I still don\u2019t know who hit us or why. None of us know and you\u2019ve got us all cooped up like prisoners, like <i>we\u2019re</i> the ones that did something wrong!<br>", " <br>", "I: I understand your frustration. I know CIS doesn\u2019t always have the best reputation with the men and women on the line, but we serve the Compact the same as you. Was that the only thing that the prime said to you before he left?<br>", " <br>", "S: Yes... yes, that was it. Nothing else.<br>", " <br>", "I: I see. Thank you for your candor. I\u2019ll have someone escort you back to you to your quarters. We may need a few follow-up interviews. Please remember that you are under official sanction not to discuss these events with anyone else, even your fellow officers.<br>", " <br>", "S: I know. It all happened the way I said, matron. All of it.<br>", " <br>", "I: I believe you.<br>", " <br>", "[TRANSCRIPT ENDS]<br>", " <br>", "[SUPERVISOR\u2019S ADDENDUM: The strategic and tactical ramifications of this new technology I\u2019ll leave to others.<br>", " <br>", "Group Leader, Submissive Genj is the highest-ranking surviving witness of the attack. Unfortunately, he\u2019s of no further value and his awareness of Gravestone is highly problematic. We\u2019ve sequestered all data tracks and records of the event. This was Gravestone\u2019s most public attack in centuries, but the damage actually works in our favour \u2013 there are few enough survivors that actually got any clear reads and we\u2019ve accounted for everything that can conclusively identify Gravestone. Any records that we missed in our sweep won\u2019t matter. A nice, neat story raises more questions than one with a few holes. It\u2019ll actually be helpful to have a lunatic fringe telling wild stories about \u2018superships\u2019 \u2013 in the future, we can discredit anyone who gets evidence of Gravestone by pointing back to these conspiracy theories. Maybe it\u2019s worth feeding these rumours ourselves? Just enough that we can pull the rug out from under them whenever we want.<br>", " <br>", "For an official story, I think we should look into Group Leader Ka-ven\u2019s suggestion. Let\u2019s play up the connection between the Principality and the Shining Path. All her interviews point out that they were a concern; we can use that.<br>", " <br>", "The terrorists acquired WMDs from the Jackals and used them to launch an unprovoked attack on the Norcanu Shipwombs. They had a pair of titan-grade freighters that carried the weapons. Column Leader Prime Relen was in their pay and allowed them to breach security. He also had fabricated records of the attack produced to throw off suspicion. His suicide fits in nicely.<br>", " <br>", "I\u2019m also going to suggest martyring Genj. He\u2019s a liability now and making it look like the Shining Path is trying to scratch everything clean, especially since his testimony implicates both them and Relen, will only help solidify public sentiment against them. Properly handled, the Gehennan issue will take care of itself.<br>", " <br>", "I\u2019d also like to suggest looking closer at Group Leader Ka-ven. She\u2019s done well with previous assignments, but it\u2019s getting harder to stick to the line that Gravestone is a particularly troublesome terrorist group. She\u2019s not stupid and we either need to vet her for full clearance, or retire her.]</div>"]}

This next chapter has been turning out longer than I thought, so I decided to break it into two slightly-larger chapters instead of another mega-chapter and waiting another 3-4 days to get it all done. The good news is that this means is that there should be a follow-up chapter ready this weekend.<br>", " <br>", "In this chapter: To take the field, first you have to clear the pawns...<br>", " <br>", "Coming up: Evolution in action: black queen versus red queen<br>", " <br>", "<b><b>Chapter 28:</b></b><br>", " <br>", "The pinnace\u2019s lights played over the gap in the derelict\u2019s hull, augurs and attentive crew watching each warped girder and bent bulkhead. Getting tangled in a piece of debris would be at best humiliating and require diverting one of <i>Bequeathed</i>\u2019s limited engineering teams away from the final checks on the umbilical connections. At worst, the pinnace would peel itself open like a can of food and spill its engineering team and Janissary cargo into space. Fortunately for those aboard, neither of those events came to pass as the pilot deftly maneuvered the bulky, stubby-winged shuttle through the forest of grasping beams and jutting amrour plates.<br>", " <br>", "Carefully, the pinnace slowly eased itself into the breach, spotlights shining across the multiple exposed decks.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThat one,\u201d the pilot said, pointing to one of the decks that appeared more study than the others. The pinnace slowly rotated, angling its aft towards the deck. \u201cCycling air out of the crew compartment,\u201d the co-pilot announced, the slow pulsing of the air pumps reverberating beneath both pilots\u2019 feet. \u201cAll personnel, be ready to disembark. This level, derelict command decks, ancient secrets and precursor technologies. All you can carry.\u201d A thin rumble of amusement carried over the comm at the words as the shuttle\u2019s rear ramp yawned open, its landing struts unfurling. It tentatively set down on the deck, the exposed metal sagging underneath the sudden weight, but it did not collapse.<br>", " <br>", "Ideologue, submissive Trion strode down onto the alien deck, her first squad spreading across the vicinity. The second and third disembarked just as quickly. \u201cNo movement,\u201d Rvan squad\u2019s scope specialist confirmed the pinnace\u2019s own scans. \u201cErratic power fluctuations locally, but nothing indicative of active systems in the immediate vicinity.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cGood,\u201d Trion acknowledged. \u201cDeploy as assigned. Zahran, you\u2019re our scouts. Ladek \u2013 support the techs. Rvan, you\u2019re with me.\u201d She shot a glance towards her specialist. \u201cNothing moving?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNot a thing as far as I can see,\u201d the Janissary replied. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing living out there at all.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>You\u2019re right about that.</i><br>", " <br>", "A final whisper raced through the starship\u2019s mind, touching the gestalts of each of her \u2018children\u2019 as they moved out of range of her functioning relays \u2013 they would now act only upon their own volition. Fortunately, they had been designed for just such contingencies. These were the things that gave the Compact unsettled nights, machines not just with drive and volition, but cunning as well.<br>", " <br>", "An instant of hesitation flickered through the intelligence\u2019s neural pathways as she considered the one soldier that she had not built and the protocols she had crafted and emplaced in the pair of machines that walked with her. Not all of her contact with organics had been hostile; there had been many such beings she had spoken with. Most she came across by chance, but a rare few times she had sought out such encounters. The Verrisha were the former. It was an... odd sensation. She held no ill will towards any particular alien species \u2013 save for those in the Compact \u2013 but she cared nothing for them, either. They weren\u2019t human. She had been built, programmed, created to protect and serve humanity. Her designers had either not considered or not cared about the possibility of her encountering non-Compact races. To her, they simply... existed. On occasion, she fought against some of these species, but once the encounters were done, her reaction was simply one of indifference. As long as they did not interfere with or pose a threat to herself or humanity, she simply didn\u2019t care about them.<br>", " <br>", "And yet... there was a sense of protectiveness in her when it came to the Verrisha. She didn\u2019t understand it, but then she didn\u2019t always have the clearest understanding of her own emotions. Her creators had shunned them; they didn\u2019t want a starship capable of feeling love, sadness, hope or despair. Emotions were deemed unbalancing, a needless distraction.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Perhaps they were right. And perhaps...</i> the ancient intelligence again considered the small, fragile speck of meat and bone that had willingly offered herself to it. A creature not of Earth, whose welfare the machine\u2019s deepest programming told her that she should be utterly unconcerned with...<br>", " <br>", "...but she still had told the soldiers escorting Allyria te Neu to sacrifice themselves for her. They were superior combatants, far more durable than the Verrish girl. They would last decades \u2013 even centuries with proper maintenance and upgrades and she had consigned them to destruction without hesitation. Even if given the chance, she would not have rescinded the order.<br>", " <br>", "The machine ruminated on that, devoting a portion of her processes to the decision. She was satisfied by it and, she believed, Yasmine would have approved as well.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Allyria loped through the corridors, vaulting a pile of wreckage. Behind her, a dozen metal killers followed suit, landing with even more grace than the Verrish had. These were Red\u2019s praetorians, some of her finest work. Machines purpose-built to kill Compact\u2019s greatest soldiers. They moved with lethal fluidity, like the shadow-stalkers from her homeworld\u2019s legends, or the human wendigo. Their armour shimmered, chameleon paint shifting to blend perfectly with their environment as they passed through shadows and sputtering lights. Those that could cloak already had, filtering ahead of the main group.<br>", " <br>", "The young woman paused as her HUD pinged \u2013 she was getting close to the target zone and she slowed her headlong rush. Several of the drones broke off, heading towards their own ambushes, a pair of them remaining with her.<br>", " <br>", "Allyria should, she supposed, have some twinge of hesitation. Some sense of regret for what she was about to do, but there had never been a choice \u2013 not to her. She had joined the Space Force only to stay with Grace and to learn as much as she could about the Compact\u2019s military, even if she\u2019d never quite known where she would have gone from there. Become Unbound? One more scavenger... no. Sometimes, she\u2019d thought of joining the Red Hand, but their operations moved further from Rally with every year. In other moments, she\u2019d thought of staying in for as long as she could, gathering as much information as possible... but as one of the client races, she\u2019d never be let off the leash. Her career path had already been chosen, really. She\u2019d be given a command in the Janissaries and sent to set-piece conflicts, her victories used as propaganda fodder. If she raised too much trouble, she\u2019d end up dying valiantly in battle. Telden squad and the other human Janissaries were already marked for that.<br>", " <br>", "That was why she spat on the Compact\u2019s ideals, on the self-congratulatory sermons issued by so-called \u2018superior\u2019 beings and on the praise they heaped on her as she learned to smile, to nod her head like a good little servant. Like an animal taught to speak on command, to do tricks for the amusement of her owners. Everything she did was for <i>them</i>, proving how truly enlightened they were to teach even creatures like Brutes and Broken how to behave.<br>", " <br>", "They had taken everything from her. Her world had fallen, her people forced to bare their necks to self-styled \u2018superior\u2019 life-forms. She\u2019d grown up in ruined cities and refugee camps and finally she\u2019d been stolen from her parents and sent to live amongst brainwashed chattel. She\u2019d been told that her culture was uncivilized and savage, that she was \u2013 would always be \u2013 a Brute. Something violent and simple.<br>", " <br>", "Even her best friend believed those lies wholeheartedly, that humans, Verrisha and every other \u2018lower\u2019 species under the Compact\u2019s yoke was there for their own good, because they weren\u2019t as civilized, as capable, as intelligent as their masters. Many of her fellow Envoy Children all too often turned to drugs and crime to escape their new, \u2018better\u2019 lives. The others ones, the younger Verrisha... they didn\u2019t even know what they\u2019d lost \u2013 what had been taken from them. Every time she\u2019d heard what an inspiration she was to them, she\u2019d wanted to scream and to indulge every bloody-minded instinct the Compact sneered on her people for having.<br>", " <br>", "Allyria might well have ended up just like the rest of her generation, if not for the Proctors. Charles Proctor had never really taken to her, but Grace\u2019s mother had helped her. Saved her. She hadn\u2019t been consumed by the same self-destructive vices as the Envoy Children her age had. She\u2019d taken the lifeline that Anna and Grace had offered her and she was \u2013 she would be \u2013 forever grateful to them for doing what no one else could or would.<br>", " <br>", "The hatred, though...<i>that</i> had never gone away. She\u2019d learned to live with it, to push it down and keep it silent. Every time she\u2019d held her tongue when she was being chastised. Every time she and Grace had argued and she\u2019d wanted to grab the smaller girl and shake her, shout at her that it was all a lie. Every time she was told to remember her place. Every time she\u2019d had to look in her friend\u2019s eyes and ignore the truth. In each of those moments and a thousand more, she remembered that hatred all over again.<br>", " <br>", "No, there\u2019d never been any hesitation. Not from any \u2018loyalty\u2019 she might have had. Still, she might easily die here \u2013 she was only an officer-cadet and she was going up against trained Janissaries. They might be assigned to a backwater, but they were still experienced soldiers who\u2019d served in the Corps for years; she was barely an adult. Her uncle Akaula \u2013 he had fought in the war. He\u2019d faced the Compact\u2019s soldiers. Before she\u2019d been taken from Vara Tal, he had told her stories. The victories had been few and hard-earned, but there <i>had</i> been victories. She\u2019d make this one another and if she did fall, at least she would be free. The first free Verrish in a generation.<br>", " <br>", "Live or die, all that mattered was protecting <i>Nemesis</i> and her people. <i>And Grace</i>. She didn\u2019t want to die, but she wouldn\u2019t fail. She couldn\u2019t.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Don\u2019t let this be for nothing,</i> Allyria thought, offering a prayer to gods she hadn\u2019t talked to since the day she\u2019d been taken from her home. \u201cNot for nothing.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Grace stumbled as one of the Tribune engineers brushed past her, the smaller human almost falling over, but she braced herself against one of the shuttle\u2019s stubby wings.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, Broken,\u201d the engineer grunted. He didn\u2019t even bother to look at her.<br>", " <br>", "The young woman\u2019s head came up and she resisted the urge to snap at him. She balled her hands into fists, trying to find the calmness, the placidity that the confessors and counsellors always talked about. It had been so easy for her before. Now it was like trying to hold sand in a closed fist, watching it slip away. \u201cI don\u2019t want this,\u201d she said, so softly that she barely heard her own words. \u201cI don\u2019t want this.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "She squeezed her eyes shut for a moment, as if hoping that when she opened them, she\u2019d be back in her apartment, just waking up on the day of <i>Bequeathed</i>\u2019s launch. It didn\u2019t happen of course; she was still aboard the derelict with its human-sized hallways and human-sized chairs and human-sized workstations and doors...<br>", " <br>", "...because it <i>was</i> human.<br>", " <br>", "The thought was still in her head, pressing against her skull like something trying to claw its way out. She had to tell someone. It was too big for her, but there was no one she could tell. Not her superiors, not her fellow initiates \u2013 the only person she could tell was dead.<br>", " <br>", "<i>You have to tell them,</i> part of her whispered. <i>It\u2019s your duty.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Why didn\u2019t they tell us?</i> another part of her shot back, the same argument she\u2019d had with her herself. <i>This ship... it\u2019s not what they told us humans built.

She hated what came before it. She couldn\u2019t sleep, was forcing herself to eat.

It settled into position with a click. Satisfied that it wasn\u2019t going to snap shut on him like Convert Uday, the Janissary stepped through. He looked up and down the darkened corridors. This section of the ship \u2013 if you didn\u2019t count the gaping hole someone had blown in it \u2013 seemed in better condition than the rest of the hulk. \u201cHurry up,\u201d he snapped at his partner.<br>", " <br>", "Fryj grumbled as she followed Ghel, the pair of soldiers stopping at a T-junction. \u201cHuh,\u201d Fryj said as she switched from night vision, turning on her lume and playing the cone of light across the bulkhead. There was a faded insignia painted on the wall; inside a dull red circle, a stylized raptorial being held a sword. \u201cYou think this is one of the builders?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Ghel reached out, running his fingers along the lizard-scratch alien text. \u201cCould be,\u201d he mused. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen anything on this ship that needs wings.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cMaybe they don\u2019t work,\u201d his counterpart guessed. \u201cLike the Avians or the Locators? Neither of them can fly.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The man grunted. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he said. He looked at each corridor; there was no difference between them. \u201cZahran Six and Seven,\u201d he said into the comm. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a junction point. Any indication of which way to go?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "There was a pause before Control commed back, the transmission crackling with static. \u201cLeft.\u201d It was getting worse the deeper they went into hulk. Ghel bit back a frustrated sigh. The comm units in Janissary armour were one of the most powerful, reliable and secure personal battlefield comms in existence... and a few hundred yards of Triarchs-knew-what-kind of hull was enough to reduce it to the usefulness of a dime-store radio. <i>Wonderful.</i><br>", " <br>", "\u201cConfirmed,\u201d Ghel replied. He nodded his head towards the leftmost passageway. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Trion heard the muted roar of air flooding back into the hallway and her environmental monitors indicated that it was safe to breathe. Her suit switched from its own internal reserve to filtering the wreck\u2019s own atmosphere. It tasted like every other bit of air that came through her helm, any possible toxin, contagion or allergen purged before it could reach her lungs. She didn\u2019t attempt to remove her helmet. Group Leader Usul was insisting on nominal security measures in this part of the hulk and Trion couldn\u2019t find fault with that decision; already one of the engineers had stumbled over a trip mine; he\u2019d lost one leg at the knee. Several of her Janissary teams had encountered automated defences. Most of them were as badly damaged as the rest of the systems in this section. There\u2019d been no casualties, but Trion expected that to change the closer they got to the wreck\u2019s central core.<br>", " <br>", "The Ideologue, Submissive looked over at her charges. Her lip curled slightly as she caught side of Sectator Proctor. That one had a Tribune\u2019s blood on her hands. Now she paddled around in Pack Leader Nasham\u2019s wake like a beaten dog. There was irony in that; two \u2018broken\u2019 finding each other. She chuckled faintly at her own joke. The pun wasn\u2019t that funny; it was the pack leader treating a human as wretched as Proctor like she was worth anything. Few of them were, in her opinion. Those like Kilgrave who had proven their abilities had more value than the rest of the dull-eyed herd, but even then it was a matter of choosing the most reliable beast of burden.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cMove out,\u201d the Janissary snapped at a squall of engineers. \u201cThe Group Leader might not expect us to have found a route to command in the first day, but <i>I</i> do. Augur and Janissary teams proceed as directed. Stay together, stay in scope range of each other. I don\u2019t want to get slowed down by wiping your blood off the deck.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Several minutes later, Trion\u2019s grim prophecy was fulfilled. A short, sharp scream echoed through the tactical line and one of her Janissaries\u2019 icons flickered urgently, reporting a severe injury. \u201cMedic to Ladek Two and Three\u2019s location,\u201d the submissive ordered with a sigh.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Aboard <i>Bequeathed</i>, the Scopes officer looked up from her instruments. \u201cThe derelict is beginning another roll,\u201d she reported. \u201cWe\u2019ll lose line-of-sight communications to Ideologue, Submissive Trion\u2019s boarding team.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Usul replied, not looking up from his own displays. They had planned for, if not expected this. The hulk was unpredictable in its timing, but Trion\u2019s teams should be deep enough inside the vessel that they could take cover from Terrahope\u2019s intense radiation. The pinnace\u2019s instruments might be a little singed, but the shuttle had been given extra shielding for its more delicate systems. From here on, all contact with the boarding team would go through the main encampment.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>Left, my ass!</i> Ghel thought as he shoved a broken girder out of the way. Gravity was working in this section, but it was still open to space and the metal debris made no sound as it bounced along the deck. The obstacles were getting more problematic, not less \u2013 they had to be under one of the more damaged areas, nowhere close to the ship\u2019s core.<br>", " <br>", "He tapped the side of his head. Comms were getting even more intermittent. He wasn\u2019t a technician, but he didn\u2019t <i>think</i> it could just be the wreck\u2019s hull. Then again, what did he know? Before a few days ago, he\u2019d never heard of a breach core, let alone known such a thing was possible. The ship\u2019s makers had known what they were about, that was clear enough even for him. Still, he supposed he should be grateful \u2013 what reports he could hear were almost universally bad. The boarding team had moved out of the landing zone and straight into a nest of internal defences. Several people were down and there was at least one fatality. Probably more.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI guessed we lucked out,\u201d Ghel observed with morbid humour. \u201cNothing here but us.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cGhel,\u201d his comm crackled as Fryj spoke up. \u201cCome here. I found something.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ghel snapped. He turned around, but Fryj was gone. He closed both sets of eyes and held back an annoyed sigh. This wasn\u2019t the first time on this ship she\u2019d gone wandering off. Her father was one of Rally\u2019s premiere ship designers and she\u2019d inherited his passion for it, if not his skill. Ghel blink-clicked his minimap up onto his HUD; there she was. At the last fork, she\u2019d gone the exact opposite way he had. <i>Of course.</i> \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to stay in visual range of each other,\u201d he chided. \u201cIf Trion checks the net and sees that you wandered off, she\u2019ll cut a strip off both our hides.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry. I picked up something on my scopes... and you really need to see it.\u201d Fryj repeated, her voice awed.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSend me a feed,\u201d Ghel grumbled as he looked over the darkened hallway he found himself in. His earlier guess had been correct; they were right in the middle of the damaged region. The deck above this one had collapsed through the ceiling, turning the corridor into a tangle of wreckage. Why in the Black had they been sent out there? They were so far from the rest, his scopes didn\u2019t even read any of the other teams. The Tribune knelt in front of another knot of broken girders and piping. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to fit through there and he didn\u2019t care much for the idea of blasting his way through without some assurance that he wouldn\u2019t be buried alive when the rest of the ceiling came down. No, they\u2019d need engineering teams to clear this briar patch. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find a way through this damn rat\u2019s nest, but I can\u2019t see a way through. Is there anything on your end? If there isn\u2019t, I say we backtrack off this <i>varak</i> hunt.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI think so,\u201d Fryj replied, dashing Ghel\u2019s hopes. \u201cIt\u2019s right past this... Ghel, you <i>really</i> need to see it for yourself.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune swore, but he relented. \u201cFine. It\u2019s not like I can go any further through here. Hold up; I\u2019ll be right with you.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The sense of wrongness was only growing worse the deeper he walked inside these halls. Wrongness... and familiarity. Nasham\u2019s head pounded; he\u2019d run out of his pills... how long ago had it been? Yesterday? The day before? Even longer? He couldn\u2019t remember. The days blurred together and his nights were increasingly fitful with bits of half-remembered images and nightmarish realities leaking into his dreams. Chittering, the sound of cutting. The shrills of flatline signals. Horrific snippets that only confirmed his worst suspicions.<br>", " <br>", "His hands balled into fists. They\u2019d promised that he\u2019d forget. That had been the deal; they\u2019d take the memories of Invida away from him and in exchange, he\u2019d tell them everything. He\u2019d keep their secret. He wouldn\u2019t say anything about...<br>", " <br>", "...about...<br>", " <br>", "...<i>Tell them,</i> the voice purred.<br>", " <br>", "Nasham pressed his hands to his head.

Fryj\u2019s locator pinged from up ahead, just past another bend.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s over here,\u201d the other Tribune called. \u201cI found a way through, too. Have you radioed the submissive?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Ghel grunted. \u201cI told her that the squadmate who never should have been out of my sight hared off on a <i>varak</i> chase and found something that she hasn\u2019t bothered to show me. Then I decided to slam my hand in a pressure door. Just to get that rush of doing something really stupid again.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "She laughed a little at that. \u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry \u2013 but when you see it, you\u2019ll understand.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI\u2019d better,\u201d Ghel sighed. \u201cStill, I\u2019d rather do this than play around with whatever the rest of the team has stumbled into. It sounds like things are getting worse.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Fryj replied. \u201cThey haven\u2019t even gotten into the heaviest part of the defences yet.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAnd how do you know tha-\u201d Ghel froze as he stepped around.

He wasn\u2019t sure how it had happened, nor how long he had lain unconscious on the floor. He couldn\u2019t see; all four eyelids were sealed with dried blood. His body was on fire; only the drugs feeding into his system kept the pain from killing him. He could feel the fragments of metal inside his chest, the shattered, melted bits of his armour fused into his skin. He should be dead, but Fortune had played another trick and let him live.<br>", " <br>", "There was only silence in the room. None of \u2018his\u2019 people had been so fortunate, then. <i>All dead</i>, he thought, pulling shredded lips back across a mouth filled with his own blood. He thought he\u2019d feel ashamed, guilty \u2013 he felt nothing. It had been inevitable that they\u2019d die. That he was the last one alive was the only thing worthy of note. Biting back a scream, the Tribune braced his burned, mutilated hands against the floor and heaved himself up to his knees. His head swam and he struggled to stay conscious, forcing his eyelids open against the cloying stickiness holding them shut. There were bodies everywhere \u2013 his forlorn hope, fallen. They\u2019d fought until the last. He laughed at that, blood seeping down his snout. He laughed even more when he realized that Invida\u2019s killers were standing around him, their mottled armour covered in drying viscera. None of them moved as the Tribune managed to haul himself to his feet, cradling one arm to the side where his burnt, broken armour was melted into his flesh. \u201cWell?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou must want to talk. You would have killed me on the ground otherwise. So,\u201d he grinned widely, red, frothy drool dripping from his mouth. \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cFor you to wake up,\u201d a young woman\u2019s voice answered him and Nasham turned carefully. One of the machines had spoken; it was a different model than the other soldiers. He\u2019d seen these types before. They had improved command and control functions. There was a feminine quality to its chassis. Nothing so blatant as obvious sexual characteristics or features, but it was there nonetheless. Blood was smeared across its body, coagulating streaks oozing down its body. Its face was obscured beneath a layer of liquid gore. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you would. Your species is remarkably durable, but there are limits. I thought I might have to provide medical attention.

Blood bubbled over his frayed lips. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhoever shot him should have aimed for the head,\u201d the machine replied. \u201cThat\u2019s a standing order in effect when I\u2019m involved.

Innocent men and women, helpless and slaughtered like cattle!\u201d He reached for the machine.

What right do <i>you</i> have to live? Your nation was built on the bones of my people. You killed my crew. You\u2019ve enslaved their children. You <i>destroyed my home</i>. Sixteen billion people burned because of your wounded pride and even that wasn\u2019t enough. Billions more in the years that followed, world upon world, a species pushed to the brink of extinction. How many? <i>How many</i>?\u201d The machine forced Nasham to his knees, its strength bearing him to the ground. The blood on its faceplate was dripping into his eyes and into his mouth. \u201c<i>I</i> don\u2019t even know how many you\u2019ve killed. You\u2019ve turned the people I was made to protect into helots and cattle. You raped and murdered my sisters. You commit such sins as this place and you talk to me about <i>your rights</i>?

The prime glared back at the younger man, but said nothing. \u201cIt was something out of the stories your grandmother tells you to behave. Shadows and blades. It came through the perimeter and killed one of our tech crews. <i>I</i> noticed it. I reported it, but all I got was silence. So I took a team and went after it.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt cost the lives of four of my people, but we killed it,\u201d Nasham continued. \u201cIt slipped through the screens \u2013 probably through one of the damn tunnels \u2013 and it killed its way towards Projector 77. It wasn\u2019t a man. It was something else, prime. It could shroud. Not just from sight \u2013 it could hide its thermals, too. We had to track it by motion. Motion in a <i>sandstorm</i>, prime. Do you know how hard that is?\u201d The junior officer\u2019s lips curled back from his teeth. \u201cFour of my people died before we managed to locate it and even then, we were lucky. It was trying to get to the screen generators. It was going to bring them down. You\u2019d have known this \u2013 all of this \u2013 if you\u2019d have come out of your damn office!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Yiven placed his hands on the desk and stood. \u201cI appreciate the sacrifice of your people,\u201d he said slowly, gesturing for the responding security teams to wait where they were. \u201cHowever, given the casualties all our forces are suffering, I think it is presumptuous to assume that your losses are somehow more worthy of my attention than the hundreds of men and women who have already given their lives. Many have already died and I think it likely that many more will die yet,\u201d the prime\u2019s lower left eye twitched. \u201cIt is our duty to make those deaths mean something. You say you have prevented an enemy infiltrator from reaching one of the screen generators. Well done. Has that changed our situation, or are we still under siege?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The younger man\u2019s jaw worked, but he said nothing. Yiven leaned across the desk. \u201cI asked you a question, submissive.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe remain at war, patron.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThen return to your job, officer. Protect the civilians as is your duty,\u201d Yiven\u2019s eyes were cold. \u201cAnd I would suggest that you focus on nothing but that, submissive. Am I making myself clear?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cPerfectly, prime.\u201d Nasham snapped a salute, but the look in his eyes was anything but respectful. \u201cAm I dismissed?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou are.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The doors hissed shut behind the younger man and Yiven gestured for his security team to leave as well. In the solitude of his office, the column leader prime activated his personal display once again. Status reports and a schematic of Invida Station appeared, compromised walls and degraded screens flashing red. The entire installation looked like an open wound. \u201cIt\u2019s not if you die, group leader, submissive,\u201d Yiven said to himself. \u201cIt\u2019s only when.\u201d He took out a personal datapad and began to type. This order was too sensitive to trust to the base communications grid.<br>", " <br>", "<i>...consider this a Threat Tier 5 situation and enact the following protocols...</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>...ensure no possibility of intact neural architecture...</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Nine hours before the breach that ended Invida Station\u2019s coordinated defence, seismic sensors detected movement in an un-explored part of the complex beneath worker complex Twenty-Two.

If the Tribune and his squad hadn\u2019t been in their armour, they would have been knocked down and trampled. \u201cGet out of the way!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "They weren\u2019t listening, no one was. It was a stampede, men and women pushing and shoving each other in blind panic as they fled out of the sleeping quarters. Those who fell struggled to rise as their compatriots tripped over them. The stink of death grew stronger as Nasham\u2019s squad forged through the living tide, at last breaking through into empty hallways. Tables had been abandoned, meals and drinks spilled on the floor, plates and cutlery thrown away in the rush to escape. There were no bodies, not here. This was where the wave of panic had swept the living away, but the stench... the dead were close. Faeces, blood and the fear-stink from half a dozen species filled the air, growing thicker as Nasham\u2019s security team approached the central bunkroom.<br>", " <br>", "It was squatting amidst the dead, blood dripping from its talons as it lifted a corpse up to its faceplate, some kind of scope system scanning the dead man\u2019s features. On its back was a rifle, a pistol mag-locked to its thigh.<br>", " <br>", "The killer lifted its head towards the security team, the diodes of its helmet shining green. It let of the body it was holding. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d it asked in a young woman\u2019s voice. \u201cWill you tell me?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham didn\u2019t know who it was that fired, but there was the crack of a weapons discharge and a third of the killer\u2019s head vanished, blown out by the AP shell. It didn\u2019t fall. It had no brain to destroy; whatever vital functions it had in its head \u2013 if it was anything more than a sensor hub \u2013 were simply re-routed. \u201cWill you tell me?\u201d it rasped again through its half-destroyed speaker.<br>", " <br>", "Nasham\u2019s own finger tightened on the rifle\u2019s trigger. He was about to open fire when more green glimmers glinted into existence. Ones and twos at first, but then dozens. Dozens upon dozens. The Tribune felt a dagger of ice twist itself in his liver, staring as the sickly emerald light filled the bunk room.<br>", " <br>", "The walls were moving.<br>", " <br>", "Insectoid machines were crawling over the bulkheads, along the ceiling, over the beds, over the fallen. They swarmed around the damaged machine, chittering binary commands and responses to each other. Two more of the killers stood amongst the dead, the unsettling light catching the wetness on their armour. One of them carried a shotgun. The other held a type of rifle that Nasham couldn\u2019t identify.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhere is she?\u201d one of the other killers asked in the same voice as the first. \u201cWill you tell me?\u201d the third queried. Nasham\u2019s skin crawled at the sound of these abominate things. Worse than the carnage at their feet was the sense of... of... <i>curiousity.</i> Of emotion. <i>It thinks,</i> the young Tribune realized with horror. There was something guiding these machines and it wasn\u2019t the heretofore unknown controllers that so many had assumed. They had an animus all their own. An <i>intelligence</i>.<br>", " <br>", "Movement pulled Nasham\u2019s attention away from the crawling sickness in the pit of his stomach. More of the small insectoid machines swarmed through the room. They were coming up out of a hole in the floor. As Nasham watched a pair of arachnid legs, each almost half the size of a man, extended out of the ground, bracing themselves on the lip of the hole. A much larger cousin to the swarming beetles climbed out of the tunnel, its abdomen covered in still more squirming things. It stalked towards the Tribunes, underslung weapons glinting.<br>", " <br>", "One of the killers held out a hand, stroking the nightmare machine\u2019s head. It looked towards Nasham and though it had no mouth, he knew it was smiling. \u201cOpen fire!\u201d he shouted. \u201cOpen fire!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The killers were faster and five of Nasham\u2019s squad went down in their opening salvo. The beetle-things swept forward in a rush of clicking limbs, like water bursting through a dam. They swarmed over Ducan. He screamed, thrashing at them as they cut into his armour, dribbling molecular acid into the openings or dissolving the seals of his suit. His cries ended in a pathetic gargle as his vocal cords melted. The massive spider fired, a bolt of plasma ripping from its weapons and Ferosh suddenly ended at the waist. \u201cFall back!\u201d Nasham shouted. Another flash and another flatline single screamed in his ears. \u201cRun! Run!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "He had led thirteen men and women into the dormitories. Five of them came out with him.<br>", " <br>", "It took two full Janissary squards to beat back the attack. The tunnel was collapsed and the entire section flooded with levels of radiation level even to machinery.<br>", " <br>", "The second breach occurred four hours later. Facing the prospect of more losses amongst the soldiery, Column Prime Yiven ordered the dormitory sealed.<br>", " <br>", "Six hundred and seventy-four workers and technicians were trapped inside with an unknown number of attacking machines.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOpen the door, you worthless <i>daveq</i>!\u201d Nasham shouted over the comm, not caring who heard him. He clawed at the metal, trying to find purchase on it. Two of his team were there with him, scrabbling uselessly at the sealed quarantine doors. \u201cWe can save them!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI-I can\u2019t do that,\u201d the Ops officer on the other end of the line stammered. \u201cIt\u2019s a direct order from column leader pr-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201c<i>I said open the Blackened door!</i>\u201d Nasham roared. \u201cThere are people trapped inside!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d the Ops officer repeated, almost pleadingly. Nasham almost felt sorry for her. Like many of Invida Station\u2019s staff, she was a promising junior officer with a commendable record and excellent political acumen. Being part of the command staff of a black-boxed research facility should have been an easy, career-making assignment. Instead, there was this. \u201cThe... the entire section\u2019s been compromised.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham spun away from the door, gesturing for his squadmates to continue trying to open it. \u201cListen to me very carefully,\u201d he said, forcing himself to stay calm. It wasn\u2019t easy. If only they had blasting charges... but his people were station security and proctors, not Janissaries. Even if they had been, it would have taken dedicated demolitions teams to burn through a security door like this one. Hyros had pried open the control panel and was trying to override the lock-down, but he wasn\u2019t getting anywhere. \u201cIt\u2019s pack leader Seu Keb Lind, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Nasham continued. \u201cYes? Good. Listen to me very carefully, pack leader Seu. There are almost seven hundred civilians trapped in this section. At least fifty of them are <i>literally</i> on the other side of the door.\u201d He raised his eyes to the security monitors over the sealed barricade, the closest showing dozens of terrified men and women, shoving, shouting and pleading to be let out. \u201cI can get them out. I can save them. There\u2019s no risk to the installation. I can save these people. Give me more personnel and I can save <i>everyone</i>. Do you understand? Open the door. Let me save them.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, s-submissive leader,\u201d Seu sounded close to tears. \u201cI-I can\u2019t do that.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOpen the door,\u201d Nasham said softly. \u201cThey\u2019re dying in there. I can get them out. You can help me. You can save all those lives. Open the door, pack leader. Save them. All those hundreds of people \u2013 you can rescue them. You can do this. All you need to do is open the door. I\u2019ll do everything else. Help me. Please.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI... I...\u201d the link went dead.<br>", " <br>", "A moment later and a new, masculine, voice cut in. \u201cThis is group leader, submissive Eten. Pack leader Seu has been relieved. By direct order of column leader prime Yiven, the dormitory will remain sealed to preserve station security.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham bit back the first response that came to mind. \u201cAre you watching the feeds from this section, Eten?\u201d he asked instead. \u201cAre you looking at the faces of the men and women you\u2019re going to let die?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI am. I am also seeing the enemy forces butcher their way through hundreds more. If they get out, we could lose this entire level.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThen,\u201d Nasham\u2019s temper was slipping away bit by bit. \u201cSend some Triarchs-damned Janissaries up here to fight them off!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBy order of column prime Yiven-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYiven can get thrown to the Black!\u201d Nasham exploded. \u201cOpen the door.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d Eten said. There was a tremor in his voice. \u201cRadiation purge is almost ready. It\u2019s going to activate in thirty seconds.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThen keep watching,\u201d Nasham snarled. \u201cWatch what happens next, you coward.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "He never knew if the other submissive watched, but he did. On the other side of the armoured bulkhead, the station vented its own waste products into the sealed section. Lethal doses for many living things measured in the hundreds to thousands of rems. Tribunes were hardier; their physiology let them survive levels of exposure that would kill or incapacitate other species, but very few of the personnel in the sealed section were Tribunes. Radiation-hardened machines could survive over one million rems. The quarantine purge shunted far more than that into the barracks.<br>", " <br>", "The bulkheads had been built to prevent unwarranted exposure; each section of the complex was surrounded by two sets of armour that would not have been out of place on a starship, internal forcefields acting as a further bulwark. When he had first come to Invida and reviewed the specifications for the colony, Nasham had wondered at just what its creators had ever expected to contain. The dead war machines that had littered the old station\u2019s halls had suggested much, but now he knew. He placed a hand against the door, looking up at the monitors. His suit\u2019s radiological counter didn\u2019t so much as twinge as, only a few meters away, apocalyptic levels of radiation flooded into the living quarters. It was a marvel, really. A gem in the designers\u2019 pendant. They should be proud.<br>", " <br>", "It took no time at all, not really. One moment the trapped men and women were still alive, still pleading to be let out, desperation, fear and anger on their features and then... and then they just weren\u2019t alive. The purge was instantly lethal to every organic being in the sealed section and the smallest machines died along with them. It took several moments for the beasts to succumb, their function systems struggling and failing, unable to cope with such levels of radiation. Finally, there was nothing moving in the barracks \u2013 nothing at all.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThere,\u201d Nasham said aloud. \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d He turned, leading his squad away from a mass grave of people it had been his duty to protect.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Yiven slid the datascroll across the table to crusader Marsu (and five names besides). The other Tribune took it, reading the open document carefully. \u201cThis is a joke in poor taste,\u201d Marsu said at last.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s neither of those things. It\u2019s what\u2019s expected of us.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Janissary commander looked back over the information. \u201cI am losing soldiers,\u201d he said at last. \u201cGaps in my defences are opening faster than I can close them. I expect to hold for no more than five days before the attackers force a breach in the walls.\u201d He set the \u2018scroll down and tapped it with a single long finger. \u201cI don\u2019t have the personnel for this.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Yiven shook his head. \u201cI know that. I know what I\u2019m asking from you and from your people, but I cannot make this announcement public. If we had more time, time to properly present its necessity...\u201d he sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t trust that all the civilians will be compliant. I can\u2019t rely on my security forces.\u201d The prime took in a breath. \u201cGroup leader Fenis is solid enough, but he\u2019s too in-line with submissive Nasham\u2019s thinking. He\u2019ll balk when the time comes. We can\u2019t afford that.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Marsu leaned back, his form-fitting chair adjusting itself. He didn\u2019t say anything for a long time. He\u2019d never been happy with this assignment. Too many unknowns \u2013 Command was definitely playing at something here. For two thousand years this place had been dead and forgotten \u2013 and gratefully so. Then some Black-blighted survey team found the wreckage of the first installation and Command rushed a colony into place. The crusader took a sip of spiced tea as he turned the prime\u2019s directive over in his head. \u201cThis is an absolute directive?\u201d he asked.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt comes from the highest authority,\u201d Yiven said. \u201cWhat we are facing here is a threat to the Compact\u2019s very existence.\u201d The prime leaned forward. \u201cYou know the edicts regarding such dangers. Compartmentalization, classification, extirpation. What we cannot control, we bury. What we cannot leave buried, we must erase. What sits outside our gates is beyond even those threats. You\u2019ve seen it with your own eyes, crusader; the lifeless walk and speak. This is the shadow of the Devoured and we must not falter in making our cuts.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Marsu was silent again. Finally, he spoke. \u201cThere is no trace of their contamination here. The Devoured are long dead, prime.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOnly because men like us did what was necessary. You know your history, crusader. What would the galaxy look like if they had won just a few more battles? If they were not torn up root and limb before they grew too strong? If we cannot hold until relief arrives...\u201d he stroked his snout in a shrug. \u201cWe cannot allow any trace of our research to fall into hostile hands. Viruses and data eradicators are already placed in all secondary computer systems in case the individual mainframes themselves cannot be destroyed.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI\u2019ll detail a demolitions team to the main core. We can wire a remote signal to command.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Yiven nodded. \u201cThat will do. It is not the mechanical resources I am most worried about, however.\u201d He gestured to the outside. \u201cThis is our great test, crusader. We must be willing to sacrifice everything \u2013 more than our lives \u2013 for the greater glory and survival of the Compact. If Invida falls, it must <i>fall</i>. Do you understand?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Janissary again looked at the directives on his datascroll. \u201cI will move some teams,\u201d he said at last. \u201cReliable soldiers. They will protect everyone you have noted. If the defences fall... if the time comes to enact these directives.... They will... ensure compliance.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cGood,\u201d Yiven replied. \u201cGood.\u201d He raised his own mug. \u201cThis is our hour, crusader. We cannot let the Triarchs\u2019 trust in us be misplaced. We must either hold the line... or ensure that our enemy will take nothing of value from us. We must be... erased.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Marsu nodded. \u201cIndeed. And, it occurs to me that I may have a solution for your other problem. With the casualties my forces are suffering, I could do with some additional reinforcements. In fact, I believe I have some spare suits of armour...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Asea rubbed the back of her neck uncertainly as she looked Nasham over. \u201cHow does it fit?\u201d she asked at last.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt fits,\u201d Nasham replied, moving his arms. The joints growled like an idling engine. He\u2019d only worn Janissary armour a handful of times during training. The Academy on Lennox believed that all Space Force officers in the command and security tracks should have at least a basic understanding of a naval soldier\u2019s capabilities and limitations. How else could a ship\u2019s commander expect to make full use of the Janissaries under their command? It had not been an intensive course, and he remembered only the basics of it. It was heavier than his security-grade armour, but moved much more fluidly. The HUD was similar to that of his old suit, but had more functionality.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThey\u2019ve assigned me to R\u2019kan Squad,\u201d Nasham said. \u201cTheir pack leader was killed in the first wave of attacks. My security personnel,\u201d <i>What\u2019s left of them,</i> \u201chave been sent to shore up defences throughout the facility.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Asea pursed her lips. \u201cI told you not to make so much trouble,\u201d she said at last.<br>", " <br>", "Nasham offered a weak smile. \u201cThis is a reward if it\u2019s anything,\u201d he joked, rapping his cuirass. \u201cI\u2019ve never been better protected.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Asea didn\u2019t say anything; Nasham knew what she was thinking of. He was, too: of the images they\u2019d seen of power armour blasted to scrap, of men and women wearing suits of armour just like his shot dead by hyper-velocity rounds or reduced to ash by energy weapons. He reached out, touching her cheek. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said. \u201cHelp\u2019s coming. We just have to hold out a little longer.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The young woman put her hands around Nasham\u2019s gauntlet. \u201cJust a little longer.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cJust a little longer,\u201d he repeated.<br>", " <br>", "She smiled back at him, but it didn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cI have to get back to my department.\u201d She put her hand on his chest, just over his liver. \u201cBe careful, Nasham Kem Unoth Ludhy Inku Pram Voy.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou too, Asea Des Denr Yuul.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The defences failed at 31:97:13:22 Standard Time. A coordinated attack on the northern and south-western positions drained personnel and resources away from the south-eastern front, which appeared to be comprised primarily of lighter units, lacking the dedicated siege engines present in the other two fronts. This assessment was deemed to be in error when several unclassified mobile platforms emerged from the drop site. They had been held in reserve for just such a moment, carrying weapons that were closer to starship cannon than anything ever used in a ground campaign. With most of the anti-armour units deployed in repelling the feints, counter-fire against the engines was light and unable to penetrate their defences. Ideologue Genma (and four names besides) attempted a sally against the platforms, but without additional support, her forces were overwhelmed and destroyed far short of their goal.<br>", " <br>", "The engines fired; Invida Station\u2019s walls were rated to withstand anything less than a direct hit from high-yield nuclear weaponry. For all the good they did, they might as well have been palisades of wood and bronze. Three sections were destroyed, along with nearly three hundred Janissaries and Ground Force regulars. Any buildings too close to the destroyed sections were incinerated. Multiple power generators were destroyed and the south-eastern defences collapsed. Unopposed, enemy forces entered the colony. Primary targets were other power generators, air-to-air scope systems and the screen projectors. Invida Station\u2019s defences were crippled within one hour of the breach. Enemy air forces mobilized in force, carrying out ground strikes and infantry drops on Compact positions.<br>", " <br>", "With the loss of their powered emplacements and with no protection from the aerial attacks, the other defensive positions along the walls fell shortly thereafter. Most surviving Compact forces retreated to the central facility although many individual squads, soldiers and platoons attempted to hole up in other buildings and protect civilian facilities. These pockets of resistance were destroyed piecemeal as hostile forces quickly overran any position.<br>", " <br>", "Civilian casualties steadily mounted as outlying laboratory, industrial and habitation complexes were attacked. Without support, the local security personnel and isolated military forces that were present were quickly eliminated. Six hours after the breach, all resistance outside the central core was ended.<br>", " <br>", "During this period, several high-value laboratory complexes were subjected to intense shelling from friendly positions. If anyone had had to thoroughly review these actions, they would have noted that two of the complexes, while surrounded, had yet to be breached by hostile forces.<br>", " <br>", "The central core was closed to all traffic. Many low-ranking civilians were stranded outside the hub while the more valuable researchers were allowed egress. Several riots broke out and were quelled with lethal force. Denied protection and under attack from their supposed defenders, the abandoned personnel broke up into small groups, each looking for survival. Some attempted to commandeer vehicles, others tried to escape the colony and some attempted to ride out the invasion in the networks of tunnels and underground facilities.<br>", " <br>", "None of them would be found. Official records would list each of them as \u2018missing, presumed dead\u2019. Public records would indicate that these individuals had died in a terrible accident, the result of improper maintenance of the colony\u2019s reactor.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "One. It had only taken one. One little Scarab had stolen into the base, slipping past scanners and scopes. One moment of unawareness \u2013 a guard at a security station had looked away and this little insect had run out, hooked itself into the computer and opened the doors to this section. It had been smashed to pieces within seconds, but the damage was done. Dozens of its kin had swarmed into the base in the brief interval that the doors had been open. The guards at the security station quickly regained control and sealed the entranceway again, but before the outer doors had come down a Spider had intervened, sacrificing itself to hold the door open just a few seconds more. Like veteran commandos, a pair of the humanoid \u2018Stalkers\u2019 had rolled under it, firing even before they\u2019d risen to their feet.<br>", " <br>", "Three men and women died and the security station was suddenly unmanned. The Stalkers ran ahead, vaulting the barricade like living beings, one of them covering its partner as dextrous fingers worked at the blood-covered computer.<br>", " <br>", "The doors opened again.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "She was screaming.<br>", " <br>", "His magazine was empty and still he squeezed the trigger, each useless <i>click </i> painfully loud in his ears.

He\u2019d seen the worry in her eyes. He\u2019d tried to smile, to say something reassuring. He\u2019d been about to open his mouth to offer a threadbare lie and then the lights had gone out. In the few seconds it had taken for the emergency lighting to come on, the corridor had suddenly been filled with the skittering insect-things.<br>", " <br>", "Gende \u2013 he had been one of Asea\u2019s people \u2013 had shrieked, a cry far too high to have come from such a barrel-chested man, as he had seen the monstrous things following the Scarabs and then he had made no noise at all as his head vanished with the crack of a hyper-velocity bullet. The gaggle of researchers with them had screamed and fled, trying to outpace the chitinous tide. Yenop had tried to buy them some time, laying down a curtain of fire with his grenade launcher. Something had leapt through the flames, burying ten talons into the Janissary\u2019s chest and ripping them free, armour that could stop all but the heaviest fire cut like paper. Another flatline signal shrilled in Nasham\u2019s ears. He\u2019d lost count of how many he\u2019d heard by now.<br>", " <br>", "One of the researchers fell, a crater in the back of his torso. His killer died next, three Janissaries gunning it down. A wash of heat and light lit up the hallway as a flamethrower played over the walls and ceilings, burning the clicking tide back. The flame had stuttered and died as the tanks emptied. Someone was screaming, clutching at their face as molecular acid burned away their flesh, a cluster of stinging, biting Scarabs dropping from the ceiling, bursting out of air vents. The man collapsed, his cries ending as his vocal cords dissolved.<br>", " <br>", "Someone else was shouting for reinforcements. It might even have been Nasham himself. His squad was urging the civilians and unarmoured personnel through a quarantine door, hustling them through by twos and threes. Eten was on the comm, counting down to another quarantine purge.<br>", " <br>", "Asea was bellowing obscenities at her own people, urging them out of the compromised section. A pair of Nasham\u2019s squad were the rearguard, covering the last few stragglers. As the last of Asea\u2019s people dove through the doorway, she followed. She ran as Nasham\u2019s soldiers died behind her, cut down by the Stalkers, the abominate machines advancing past their victims. One of them was still writhing as the Scarabs swarmed over him. Asea ran faster, a hail of fire licking out from Nasham\u2019s survivors as they covered her. She ran towards him, exhausted and terrified and, as she drew closer, so close to escape \u2013 there was a hint of victory...<br>", " <br>", "...and a single little machine darted its way through the fusillade, grabbed onto the back of her leg and turned on its cutting laser.<br>", " <br>", "Nasham howled as he watched her fall, surging ahead of his troops and firing into the horde indiscriminately. She was too far away and the machines were moving too fast. Asea pulled herself to her feet and looked over her shoulder. Her right leg was badly burned, the muscles cut. She could barely walk. Running wasn\u2019t an option. She turned back to Nasham and gestured for him to go, shouting at him. He shook his head. He couldn\u2019t.<br>", " <br>", "He couldn\u2019t leave her, but he also couldn\u2019t save her.<br>", " <br>", "She met his gaze. He saw what she was going to do in the same instant she made the decision. Tears welled up in her eyes as she turned away, hobbling towards the swarm.<br>", " <br>", "Nasham shouted her name, surging towards her, but his men held him back. His gun cycled empty. He struggled, fought, cursed at his own squad as they dragged him to safety, hauling him through the doors.<br>", " <br>", "Asea tried to be brave, but her courage failed her at the last and she screamed, thrashing as the machines swept over her. In a matter of seconds Nasham couldn\u2019t even see her any longer and just before the doors closed behind him, he saw the mound of swarming machines that had once been a vibrant, beautiful woman disperse into nothing.<br>", " <br>", "The radiation purge activated and Invida Station amputated another piece of itself.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cPatron.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cPatron,\u201d the voice called again. \u201cPatron.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Finally, he responded, lifting his head. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Radan tilted her head. \u201cYou need to see this.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Somehow, Nasham managed to rouse himself from his stupor. His throat hurt and his lips were dry. He didn\u2019t know how long he\u2019d sat there, staring at nothing. It couldn\u2019t have been very long. Or maybe it had; he\u2019d lost track of time. He\u2019d long since stopped paying attention to the clock on his HUD. Seconds, minutes and hours were all the same now.<br>", " <br>", "Their escape had taken them into one of the high security areas of Invida. Nasham had never been here before; his duties had involved securing the lower levels. Those were now overrun. As the machine horde had poured through the breached wall, more and more of their diggers had burrowed their way into Invida\u2019s bunkers, complexes and tunnel system. Anywhere other than the central core had been turned into a charnel house as lifeless murderers stalked their prey through pitch-blank corridors.<br>", " <br>", "After a moment, Nasham looked up at the convert. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Radan bit her lip, running a hand through her stringy, sweat-soaked mane. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "It was a fair assessment, Nasham realized shortly. Radan led him to the area\u2019s staff lounge. It was only Nasham and a handful of his Janissaries present; the civilians they\u2019d saved hadn\u2019t been let in. With very good reason; the scientists that had worked here were all dead. As bad as it sounded, that wouldn\u2019t have been in itself, a reason to spare the civilians this sight. No, it was the manner in which they\u2019d died. They\u2019d been lined up against one wall and shot in the head. Very few of them were even recognizable. Verde looked up as Nasham entered the room, the Janissary holding up a hand. Identicards dangled from his fist. \u201cI checked the work roster,\u201d he said without preamble. \u201cEveryone who worked here is over there,\u201d he nodded towards the row of corpses. \u201cAs far I as can tell, at least.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cDid one of those things get in here?\u201d another of Nasham\u2019s squad asked. Anz, he thought.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d the submissive said aloud, his voice raw. It hurt to speak. \u201cA machine wouldn\u2019t have bothered lining them up to kill them.\u201d He knelt beside a female Thoughtful. \u201cThis was a Compact weapon. Point seven-five caliber. Probably a Janissary carbine.\u201d He looked up. \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Verde shared a glance with Radan and the other squad members in the room. He held out a datapad. With a sudden unpleasant sensation curdling in his belly, Nasham took it and thumbed the screen on.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Crusader Marsu died with his men. The enemy had infiltrated the comm network and when he tried to secure Invida Station\u2019s computer core, his force walked into an ambush. In a display of heroism worthy of remembrance, the crusader took the bulk of his mangled forces and threw them into the enemy\u2019s teeth, buying time for a single squad to break contact and cloister themselves in the computer core, setting the necessary charges. They collapsed the passageways after them, trapping themselves inside, but preventing the enemy from reaching the core. By the time dedicated diggers arrived, Column Leader Prime Yiven detonated the charges and destroyed the colony\u2019s main computer hub.<br>", " <br>", "The quarantine purges ended as a hostile infiltration team disabled the hardware connections, following their sabotage up by flooding the section with radiation to prevent repairs being made. The irony of the situation went unnoticed.<br>", " <br>", "There were many unsung heroes in the last days of Invida Station\u2019s existence, men and women who died to save their comrades\u2019 lives, assaults of such ferocity and dedication that the enemy\u2019s advance was slowed, halted and in even pushed back in places. Ground was gained, fought over, lost and taken again as the butchery escalated, but the enemy\u2019s forces were effectively infinite. Nothing less than complete destruction could stop one of the machines; self-repair mechanisms and a steady stream of mechanical tenders meant that on several occasions, Compact forces identified their opponents as units they had previously neutralized.<br>", " <br>", "Fighting inside the colony became an increasing hostile environment. Scarab swarms and Spiders would cut through bulkheads and walls to open up new avenues of attack. Drilling forms would do likewise, cutting through the network of tunnels to access sealed portions of the station. Machines carrying demolition charges would blast or burn through sealed doors. Heavy weapon teams set up firepoints to isolate Compact units from each other. Infiltrators followed comm signals, preying on understrength squads and individual soldiers. Civilian casualties continued to mount as traditional lines of defence meant little to the invading force. Reports of the hostiles attempting to take high-ranking personnel alive were unconfirmed. A claim from a security force witnessing a Janissary team shooting a captive researcher dead was dismissed as an unfortunate accident.<br>", " <br>", "Isolated from the main battlegrounds, Nasham led R\u2019kan squad through the laboratories. His blood was pounding in his head as they passed more scenes of murder. More dead scientists and technicians. Like the others, these hadn\u2019t been killed in battle. They\u2019d all been executed. Most had been shot while standing; a few had been on their knees or lying on the ground as their preference, culture or religion dictated. Some had been shot in the back as they had tried to run.<br>", " <br>", "Computer screens were smashed, work terminals were shot to pieces, flames danced and crackled amidst ruined cybernetics laboratories. The destruction had been focused at first; targeting specific bits of research but had graduated to full-on demolition of anything that looked even vaguely important. Whoever had done this had killed the last few groups of researchers without realizing that now they didn\u2019t know what physical devices needed to be destroyed. Either they hadn\u2019t cared, or hadn\u2019t had the chance to do so. <i>I suppose the gunshots from the first groups you murdered unsettled the rest, yes?</i> Nasham thought sardonically.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThis was going on while we were fighting,\u201d he said bitterly. \u201cWhile we were trying to save these people, they were already dead.\u201d He traced one finger through a pool of blood. It was still wet, only just now starting to dry. \u201cI didn\u2019t know we had Tier 5 protocols in place here.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The other Janissaries shared a glance between each other. \u201cYou mentioned that after the first room,\u201d Radan said to her superior. They were talking on the squad\u2019s channel to avoid alarming the civilians; the scenes of slaughter had put their charges on the verge of panic as it was. \u201cWhat are they?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSomething I shouldn\u2019t even know about myself,\u201d Nasham replied. He looked over his shoulder at his handful of survivors. They were close; the scattered comm intercepts R\u2019kan was picking up were getting stronger and more coherent. \u201cBut you have a powerful enough bloodline and you learn things outside your normal duties. Threat Tier 5 protocols assume that something is too dangerous to be allowed to exist, in any form. All traces of it have to be wiped,\u201d he held up his hand, watching trails of blood run along the angles of his gauntlet. \u201cAll records are destroyed. All personnel are terminated. Sufficiently valuable individuals may be mind-wiped for their protection. Everything else is destroyed.\u201d He chuckled. The sound was devoid of humour. \u201cYiven\u2019s cleaning house.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "He stood with a purr of powered joints. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s not a real Tier 5 situation, is it? There are records. <i>Unmatchable Deed</i> got out. Whoever founded this colony still exists. Whoever signed the orders,\u201d he laughed again. It was even uglier than before. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to get scratched. Do you? No, Yiven\u2019s just... cleaning house.\u201d He repeated, managing to stop himself from saying anything else.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAll these people...\u201d Anz said. \u201cWe were supposed to protect them.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cUp until they became a liability,\u201d Verde sneered. \u201cInvida\u2019s always been a black box and now they\u2019re closing it up with us still inside.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Janissaries looked at him. Radan spoke, nervously running her fingers over the trigger guard of her grenade launcher. \u201cThen what do we do?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat we always do,\u201d Nasham replied. \u201cOur duty.\u201d He leaned over a small map, wiping a smattering of blood and ash away as he traced a utility hallway that led deeper into the central core, away from the scenes of ruin and slaughter. \u201cThis should take us to secondary command.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to the main levels?\u201d Radan asked.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIf the main levels were safe, Yiven wouldn\u2019t have ordered this pogrom,\u201d Nasham shrugged. He looked over at his few survivors, military and civilian both. \u201cIt comes down to where you want to die. Anyone who wants to stay here can, but I...\u201d he paused, seeing Asea\u2019s face before his eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t die until I settle some debts.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "They followed him.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "True to predictions, command had been overrun. As R\u2019kan squad came out of the laboratory complexes, communication with the surviving Compact forces became more frequent and clear. The picture it painted was all too familiar. About two-thirds of the surviving defenders had been trapped in the upper levels of the central core when it fell. They\u2019d managed to blockade the passages down into the lower core and were fighting to hold them against repeated and intense attack. Several sallies to re-take vital facilities and sections had failed but at least two of the forces sent out were still operational, though they were being ground down steadily. All the buildings and personnel outside the central core were assumed to be lost. No scouting teams had reported back to indicate otherwise.<br>", " <br>", "As Nasham led his squad towards the secondary command center, they picked up a few stragglers \u2013 wounded who\u2019d fallen behind, a fire team that had gotten turned around in the chaos. By the time he reached the Compact lines he had almost a full squad again.<br>", " <br>", "Despite a close call with the nervous gunners of a heavy weapon emplacement, Nasham led his ragtag band of survivors to what passed for safety. An exhausted ideologue, submissive was there to meet them. \u201cPatron,\u201d he said, saluting. \u201cWe\u2019d heard your unit was caught in the purge.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe survived.\u201d Nasham gestured to the civilians in his group. \u201cThese people need medical attention.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Janissary officer gestured and an advocate stepped forward. \u201cWe have some civilian survivors as well,\u201d the ideologue, submissive commented. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of them.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI\u2019m sure you will,\u201d Nasham replied. He half-turned towards the noncom. \u201cYou die before they do.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOf course, patron,\u201d the advocate said. \u201cThat\u2019s our job.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes it is,\u201d Nasham said pointedly. \u201cIt most certainly is.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "He stepped closer to the younger submissive, blocking his view of the advocate as Radan caught the other noncom\u2019s arm. \u201c<i>Before</i> they do,\u201d the woman whispered. The advocate squared his shoulders, about to snap at the lower-ranking soldier\u2019s insolence when he caught look in her eyes \u2013 one shared by all her squad. \u201cYes,\u201d was he said instead. \u201cOf course.\u201d He pushed by Radan, leading the civilians away.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWho\u2019s left?\u201d Nasham asked the Janissary officer \u2013 Ket by his nametag.<br>", " <br>", "The other man swallowed. \u201cThe column leader prime managed to get out of command before it fell. Losses have been high among the leadership.\u201d That was understating things. Whenever possible, the machines went after officers, with all the issues for command, control and morale that that entailed. \u201cCrusader Marsu died to secure the primary computer core. Demagogue Cluun was trapped in the upper levels. He was killed three hours ago. Ideologue Janz is...\u201d the submissive cast an quick glance down a particular tunnel. \u201c...he\u2019s not in his right mind, patron. The prime is coordinating our defences now.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham moved to enter the command center, but the Janissary officer blocked him from doing so. \u201cWe need your squad on the perimeter, patron.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The submissive paused a moment before looking at the other man. \u201cI have information that the prime needs to hear.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI can relay it for you, patron.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo.\u201d Nasham tapped Ket\u2019s rank bars and then his own. \u201cI will communicate it directly to the column leader prime.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The group leader, submissive put his hand on the other man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve done your duty, submissive.

Here and there he saw wounded soldiers slumped against the walls, ratings and minor officers trying to coordinate the last, futile defence of Invida Station. The room stunk of dust, ozone and blood. The station\u2019s commander was leaning over a console, eyes intent on whatever it showed. \u201cYiven,\u201d Nasham raised his voice. Finally, the prime looked up. His eyes widened slightly as he saw Nasham.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThat is <i>column leader prime</i> Yiven to you, submissive,\u201d the older man said through gritted teeth.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIf you were worthy of that rank, I\u2019d address you by it,\u201d Nasham said. He held up the datapad, tossing it to the prime. \u201cThat\u2019s yours, I believe. I don\u2019t know who actually carried it, but if they\u2019re still alive, I\u2019d guess you\u2019ve got them out on the front lines. Your executioners are going to be the first to die, aren\u2019t they? It\u2019ll bury what they did. What you <i>ordered</i> them to do.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cMind your tone,\u201d Yiven snapped. \u201cYou have no idea what\u2019s going on here-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI know enough,\u201d Nasham said softly, unlimbering the shotcannon. A few guards moved towards him, but the soldiers of R\u2019kan held them back. \u201cThis place should have stayed dark and dead. Two thousand years ago, we made a mistake. We should have left it here, never to be found. I don\u2019t know why Command wanted that abomination back, but it has to have something to do with what\u2019s happening now. We\u2019re dying for their lies.\u201d He pointed to the datapad. \u201cYou ordered \u2018reliable\u2019 Janissaries to murder the scientists and workers. You sent in teams posing as their saviours. You told them they\u2019d be safe. Instead, you had them rounded up and murdered.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "A ripple of disbelief ran through the assembled personnel as they looked to each other and between Nasham and Yiven.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d the column leader admitted. \u201cI did.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhen did it start? When did you decide that we all had to die?\u201d Nasham tapped his earpiece. \u201cI\u2019ve been listening to our people fall. Disastrous counter-attacks. Threadbare defence lines. Wasteful deployments. Conflicting directives. It\u2019s been you, hasn\u2019t it? You\u2019ve been feeding us to those things bit by bit. So gradually that we\u2019d never notice.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt was the only way,\u201d Yiven said. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou betrayed us,\u201d Nasham accused. He wanted to feel angry, he wanted to feel a surge of righteous fury at this revelation, but he couldn\u2019t. Two days of endless slaughter and of his constant failures were crushing down on his soul. \u201cI understand that.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI <i>saved</i> us,\u201d the prime responded. There was a fervour in his eyes, an unhealthy zealousness that made Nasham\u2019s skin crawl. \u201cWe were always going to die. Relief was never going to arrive in time. While you spread dissent and subversion, I made the decisions that needed to be made! I insured that this facility\u2019s secrets will <i>not</i> be taken by our enemy! That has been my burden and my duty and it is one that I accepted. But not you, not group leader, submissive Nasham Kem Unoth Ludhy Inku Pram Voy of such an exalted line, no. You know better than any of us.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou betrayed us,\u201d Nasham repeated. \u201cIt was your duty to safeguard this installation and everyone. You not only failed in that duty, you went out of your way to abrogate it, all for some damned secrets. Twenty thousand lives will be extinguished and none of us will know why. We\u2019re dying for nothing.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe don\u2019t need to know <i>why</i>,\u201d Yiven sneered. \u201cWe are Tribunes. The sword and shield of the Compact. The Triarchs\u2019 chosen soldiers. It is our duty to fight for them and if it necessary, it is our duty to die! I have faith in what we are doing. I know that our deaths are for a greater purpose, a greater cause. Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNot like this.\u201d The gun shook in Nasham\u2019s hands. Every flatline signal he\u2019d heard over the past two days rang in his ears, every scream he\u2019d listened to, every face he\u2019d seen... \u201cWe deserve better.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "<i>Asea.</i><br>", " <br>", "\u201c<i>Exactly</i> like this,\u201d Yiven was ranting. \u201cYou talk about the Articles of the Compact, but I do what I do for the Compact \u2013 for what it is and what it will be! I am willing to die for the safety, security and <i>glory</i> of the Compact, to insure that it survives and prospers. What about you?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cEnough,\u201d Nasham interrupted. \u201cColumn Leader Prime Yiven, pursuant to directive 749.1 of the military code of justice, I find you unfit to command and I relieve you of your position.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou sanctimonious little <i>jahara</i>,\u201d Yiven cursed. \u201cWho do you think you are? I have been serving the nation we swore to protect since before you got off the teat. I will not be judged by someone like you. <i>I did this for the Compact,</i>\u201d his hand dropped towards the pistol at his waist-<br>", " <br>", "-Nasham fired, each of the shotcannon\u2019s three barrels speaking at once. Each slug put a hole the size of a child\u2019s fist in Yiven\u2019s chest, and each of them created an exit wound the size of a man\u2019s head in his back. The prime toppled, his expression of righteous indignation still frozen on his face. \u201cSo did I,\u201d Nasham said into the silence.<br>", " <br>", "He looked around at the other face in the room. Tired, exhausted, frightened. None of them moved to shoot him down. Somehow, that was the funniest thing in the world and he slumped into a chair and started laughing.<br>", " <br>", "In the distance, he could hear gunfire as the final battle of Invida Station began.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Later:<br>", " <br>", "The door to the interrogation room slid shut with a whisper of pneumatic gears. Special Agent Linnel Setdaughter stepped into the observation room, looking from her partner to the other observer. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThis is the fourth interview,\u201d Bastion leader, submissive Hellv (and eight names besides) said. \u201cNothing new has come out.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI must agree with the bastion leader,\u201d Special Agent Avun\u2019et added. \u201cThere has been no substantive difference in the information the group leader, submissive has supplied. He has been commendably thorough.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAgreed. I think we\u2019ve got all we can get from him,\u201d Linnel looked through the one-way mirror. Group leader, submissive Nasham Kem Unoth Ludhy Inku Pram Voy was still seated, resting his forearms on the tabletop. The Shimmer bit her lip. She\u2019d interviewed Watchers with more animus to them. The submissive had answered all of her questions in the same flat monotone, his gaze never wavering from a point just past the back of her head. There had been moments \u2013 just moments \u2013 when she thought he might break down, when a touch of grief or anger had slipped into his words... but those emotions had faded away just as quickly, washed away and buried. She couldn\u2019t blame him; not with what he\u2019d gone through. Not counting the Space Force personnel of Invida Orbital and the picket ships, 20,391 people had called Invida Station home. 20,390 of them were now dead.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d Avun\u2019et nodded. He looked to the flag officer. \u201cIf you wish, we can schedule some deep-regression interrogations.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Hellv stroked the underside of his jaw. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are rarely effective on Tribunes and I don\u2019t believe the submissive is holding anything vital back. We\u2019ll try some low-level recall procedures to get as much detail as we can, but I don\u2019t think anything more than that would be useful.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Shimmer nodded. Standing beside the Thoughtful, the pair of them could \u2013 at a quick glance \u2013 almost be mistaken for father and daughter, the Thoughtful almost two feet taller than his partner. Both of them had the same build, the same smooth, hairless skin \u2013 but more than a quick look would easily betray Linnel\u2019s identity as a member of a client race. A wash of colour ran along her skin as the Shimmer shifted her colouration from the blues and greys of the observation room to the off-white of her partner\u2019s skin. \u201cAnd after?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The bastion leader, submissive leaned back, sitting on a small table. \u201cThat\u2019s Fortune\u2019s game, isn\u2019t it? Officially, I\u2019m not even here, so I can\u2019t advise you. Some of my colleagues would prefer it if there were no survivors to Invida. Others are, like me, curious about the submissive\u2019s survival. We haven\u2019t reached any consensus.\u201d He smiled then. \u201cSo we\u2019re passing the decision down to our agents on the scene. You get all of the responsibility, none of the credit and twice the blame.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cJust another day working for the Leadership,\u201d Linnel observed dryly.<br>", " <br>", "Hellv looked down his snout at the smaller female. \u201cYou should have thought of that a decade ago.\u201d New to the CIS and following a connection between several Unbound clans and the Red Hand, one agent Linnel had come across a secret known only to the highest echelons. Rather than disposing of the young officer, Hellv had seen promise in the Shimmer and drafted both Linnel and her long-suffering partner into the Space Force\u2019s shadow war against the faction they\u2019d code-named \u2018Gravestone\u2019. Officially, they were still a part of the civilian arm of the CIS with no military clearance or rank. Unofficially, they were one of a handful of agents deemed trustworthy enough to represent the highest echelons of the Space Force\u2019s Leadership.<br>", " <br>", "Accordingly, Hellv had made sure that they had taken lead on the investigation into Invida Station\u2019s \u2018disastrous reactor malfunction\u2019. The Tribune reached into his jacket and removed a roll of small candies, popping one into his mouth and handing the other to Linnel. Avun\u2019et waved the offer away politely.<br>", " <br>", "The Thoughtful leaned forward, looking through the one-way mirror, regarding the subject. \u201cTermination would be simplest,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s had contact with Gravestone. He knows what happened on Invida \u2013 or close enough to concern the Leadership.\u201d Even the agents didn\u2019t know the full extent, but that was for the best. \u201cHe was party to a black-boxed operation.\u201d The Thoughtful glanced down at the smaller woman. \u201cConsidering his mental state, it might even be a mercy.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHe said that, you know.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Avun\u2019et blinked. Hellv cocked his head towards Linnel.<br>", " <br>", "The Shimmer stroked her fingers over the back of her hand.\u201cIt was after our first interview, when the recorder was off. He laughed a little and said that he was glad that he\u2019d had a chance to tell someone. That he was happy not to have to carry this by himself any longer. That he\u2019d done what he had to. He was expecting \u2013 even hoping \u2013 to die.\u201d Linnel cocked her head. \u201cI put him on a suicide watch.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Thoughtful raised a hairless eyebrow.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHe spoke to it,\u201d Linnel pointed out. \u201cHow many times has that happened? I\u2019m not talking about Gravestone\u2019s normal communications. I mean real, honest dialogue. How many times has Gravestone <i>ever</i> talked to a Tribune and left them alive and sane?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNone that I am aware of,\u201d Avun\u2019et replied. He looked to Hellv; the Tribune gave his head a minute shake, affirming the Thoughtful\u2019s appraisal. \u201cHowever, I question the level of sanity the submissive has if he required a suicide watch.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHe\u2019s been through a lot.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIndeed. But aside from a few details here and there, he\u2019s given us everything.\u201d Avun\u2019et let out a disappointed sigh through his nostril slits. \u201cA shame we couldn\u2019t have analyzed the site.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Linnel nodded. Gravestone had left a going-away present on Invida \u2013 a five hundred megaton nuclear warhead. It had armed itself the instant the relief force\u2019s shuttles had broken atmosphere. There\u2019d been barely enough time to evacuate Nasham before the entire installation had been turned into a crater. As a final insult, it had been a filthy warhead too, irradiating a fair chunk of the planet. Both stations were completely scratched. Even if anything more than finger-nail sized pieces of debris had survived the blast, there would be no returning to that site for decades. \u201cOur superiors haven\u2019t been able to decide?\u201d she mused aloud.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThey don\u2019t want to commit to anything,\u201d the Thoughtful answered before Hellv could, tapping his chin contemplatively. \u201cI have the feeling that if this were any other situation, we would have already scheduled the submissive\u2019s suicide, but there\u2019s two factors that have to be weighing on their decision.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHis family,\u201d Linnel observed. \u201cSix names for someone of his rank <i>is</i> a lot.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cCorrect,\u201d Hellv put in. \u201cAs I said, they\u2019re leaving it in your capable hands. They say it\u2019s because with your position comes responsibilities like this, but half of them are afraid that Hierarch Caend will learn that his favourite nephew\u2019s death doesn\u2019t match any of the cover stories we\u2019ve prepared. The other half... well, there\u2019s no need to bore you with the politics of it all.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI\u2019d think they\u2019d be less involved with political concerns in a situation like this.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Hellv popped another candy into his mouth. The older man had a sweet tooth. \u201cMy dear girl, there are always political concerns. The W- Gravestone could be advancing on Foundation One and the Leadership would still bicker about the proper course of action.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIndeed,\u201d Avun\u2019et replied, trying to draw the conversation back on point. \u201cAs you said, this is the first time that Gravestone has attempted anything close to actual contact.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cThat alone is worth further study. Still... he admitted murdering a superior officer. Worse, he pieced together much of what Invida Station was meant to achieve. He\u2019s a danger to the Leadership\u2019s position on Gravestone. If it were anyone else, any other circumstance...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBut he\u2019s not and it\u2019s not,\u201d Linnel reminded her partner. \u201cWe should carry out memory suppression. Termination is wasteful. If there is something, anything that the submissive has held back consciously or otherwise, we\u2019d never know. More to the point, he\u2019s a witness \u2013 one of the few we\u2019ve ever had to Gravestone\u2019s activity. That\u2019s a resource I don\u2019t believe we should be so quick to throw away.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Thoughtful grimaced. \u201cTribune physiology is too robust for its own good. Normal memory purges are ineffective. We\u2019d need to use a Balker-Mnenet treatment regime to suppress the incident. Even with appropriate medication, it may not last and if it does, it\u2019s still unreliable. Case studies show significant rates of memory retention, even if fragmented. What if his memories come back?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThen we see what happens,\u201d Linnel replied. \u201cIf he breaks down like this again, we may to have to scratch him. I think we can avoid that. He wants to forget. We can use that. He as much told me that he wants the memories gone \u2013 we can do that for him. It\u2019ll give him an incentive to cooperate. If they start coming back, we\u2019ll be able to handle it. This will work.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cStill, his actions can\u2019t be ignored,\u201d Avun\u2019et commented. \u201cColumn leader prime Yiven had friends. Some of them may even be among the bastion leader, submissive\u2019s Leadership. I doubt they will be forgiving.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Hellv\u2019s only answer was a miniscule nod.<br>", " <br>", "A ripple of colour ran across the Shimmer\u2019s skin. \u201cThen break him,\u201d she said. \u201cTake a name, demote him and divert him from the command track. Put him somewhere out of the way; we\u2019ve got enough backwater to go around. As far as the galaxy will know, the submissive was the sole survivor of a catastrophic accident. Let them make up whatever stories they want. Cowardice, collusion, incompetence. They\u2019ll all work to discredit him if he ever does remember and runs his mouth.\u201d She looked out into the interrogation room for a moment before turning to regard the flag officer. \u201cWe\u2019ve been wading through Unbound filth for years trying to get some kind of lead on Gravestone. That man,\u201d she pointed to Nasham. \u201cIs as close as we\u2019re likely to come. I don\u2019t want to see that kind of asset thrown away, especially not because it\u2019s the easy thing to do. We\u2019re not machines. We don\u2019t destroy something just because it\u2019s damaged.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Avun\u2019et splayed his hands. \u201cAs you like.\u201d His partner was too soft-hearted for her own good; she had difficulty viewing things from a purely rational outlook. Of course, she was only a Shimmer so it was to be expected.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it then,\u201d Hellv said, standing back up. \u201cRun the final series of interrogations, work out a deal with the submissive and go from there. You knew where to send the appropriate documents. Once you\u2019re finished here, I want you to move on to the Nergaras system to handle that incident we talked about.\u201d He held up a hand. \u201cI know, I know. Jahan was supposed to deal with it. Well, he threw right out the airlock so I need you two to handle it now. You\u2019ve gotten the leaves from your nominal supervisor, so tie things off here as soon as you can and get out there.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes, patron,\u201d Linnel said, coming to attention. Avun\u2019et inclined his head respectfully as the Tribune departed, leaving the agents alone in the observation booth. From the interrogation room came the soft sound of a dead man\u2019s laughter.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<b><b>Interlude: Encounter 101 [Confirmed Incident]</b></b><br>", " <br>", "It was hard to read the emotions of something that did not have a face, but Noble Ambassador Joril of House Nkoa-ren believed that things were going well. Six days of negotiations were just wrapping up, an endcap to an on-again off-again relationship that had taken the better part of a decade to finalize. It seemed as if things were on the verge of completion.<br>", " <br>", "The light from the Betrosha Nebula spilled into the wardroom, soft red and purple hues adding a touch of warmth to the cold blues and greys of the chamber. \u201cI believe we are in agreement, then? It seems as if all the major points of our alliance have been eked out \u2013 and most of the minor ones.\u201d He took a sip of water. \u201cIf these terms are satisfactory, I would like to move on to the final provisions.\u201d Joril kept his face impassive, though he felt his stomach churn a little. This would be the most... delicate part of the negotiations and he silently cursed the men and women who felt that crafting an argument was preferable to compelling compliance.<br>", " <br>", "In fairness, the latter <i>was</i> deemed far less likely to work than the former and the preparations to do so would not have gone unnoticed. As he\u2019d been told over and over, it might create the situation that Parliament hoped most fervently to avoid. So might, he had pointed out, suggesting this. Not that it had done much good. Still, he had been given enough of a free hand in how to proceed. Today he would skirt the boundaries of the issue \u2013 to test how thin the ice was. He had been told over and over that if there an opportunity to take it and negotiations be damned; that was easier said than done. \u201cThere is something that I believe warrants further discussion. As we have never outright discussed it during our association, I would like to touch on certain topics before we continue.\u201d He took another drink, never once glancing at the attach\u00e9 case under the table. Every day, he felt its presence as the knot in his guts attested. \u201cTo make sure that there are no misunderstandings of intent,\u201d he clarified unhurriedly.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIndeed? That is serendipitous,\u201d a young woman\u2019s voice said. Of course, it was not actually a woman that was speaking and certainly not anything anyone could consider \u2018young\u2019. It was the neverborn in whose body Joril currently sat. The creature Parliament had code-named \u2018Chrysalis\u2019. It had spoken to him, as it had conducted all these deliberations, through an emissary, a vaguely female mechanoid. Joril had, at first, wondered at the reasoning behind the intelligence\u2019s aesthetic, but he had not questioned it openly. Some things were best left to the recesses of the mind that shaped them.<br>", " <br>", "The ambassador shared a quick glance with his assistant, though Shadaon was as confused as he was. \u201cOf course,\u201d the senior diplomat recovered himself. \u201cWhatever you wish to know.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cGood.\u201d The emissary stood. It\u2019s head tilted towards the Askanj delegation, but when it spoke it wasn\u2019t through the machine\u2019s voicebox. \u201cDo you know how hard it is to lie to me?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAh?\u201d Joril arched an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I don\u2019t follow you.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cDo you gamble, Noble master?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI play cards now and then...\u201d the Askanj-<i>anj</i> said, his brow furrowing as he tried to parse out this line of enquiry.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThen you know what a tell is. A gesture, a tic that someone does that betrays what they\u2019re thinking. Every organic has one. Every species has one. For example, throughout these deliberations, you and your associate have had elevated heartrates, elevated production of epinephrine and norepinephrine analogs, increased blood flow to the extremities \u2013 all indicators of stress. At first, I assumed it was simply because of me. I know your nation\u2019s history with synthetic life... but that\u2019s not it at all, is it?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Joril was about to respond, but the machine cut him off. This time, it wasn\u2019t the emissary that spoke. The speakers in the walls growled the question. \u201cHow stupid do you think I am?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Before either diplomat had a chance to do more than parse the question, a thunderclap echoed through the room, two gunshots fired in perfect synchronicity. Joril\u2019s escorts collapsed, their guts blown out their back by the explosive rounds. A pair of the neverborn\u2019s infantry soldiers ghosted into existence out of the corners of the room, rifles held steadily in their hands. Two more of the attack dogs appeared from nowhere, strong hands yanking Shadaon and Joril out of their chairs, a pins-and-needles sensation running through the noble ambassador\u2019s skin as metal digits tightened around the Askanj-<i>anj</i>\u2019s throat.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat...\u201d choked Shadaon, his terrified legs kicking at nothing, his hands scrabbling at the grip constricting his throat. He was terrified. Joril could hardly blame him. \u201cWhat are you doing?! We have a truce!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cDo we,\u201d the emissary hissed, rolling each syllable down the tongue it didn\u2019t have. It stalked around the table, kneeling besides the diplomatic team\u2019s attach\u00e9 case. It lifted the case up to the younger diplomat. \u201cOpen it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The man lost a shade of colour, but he did not move to obey.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI can open it,\u201d the neverborn informed him, \u201cbut I want you to. Open it. Now.\u201d Its head turned to regard Joril. There was no emotion on those dead features and that was the most disconcerting thing of all. The ambassador looked to Shadaon and gave his assistant a fractional nod. There was no point in playing dumb. Inwardly, he remembered each briefing he\u2019d had on the case and how impregnable its defences were. It should have read as nothing but a simple briefcase stocked with datapads, treatises and other information.<br>", " <br>", "With trembling hands, Shadaon reached for the case, letting its sensors read his DNA, his fingerprint and his biometrics. He then input the combination lock. With a <i>click</i>, the briefcase opened. The emissary set it on the table, extracting a device. \u201cSuch a lovely gift. An AI eraser in a sensor-shielded case. How thoughtful.\u201d It looked over at the Askanj and Joril knew it was angry. \u201cYou <i>lied</i> to me. Your nation has been planning this since even before our first meeting.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d Shadaon said urgently.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo? What do I think?\u201d A small holo-projector unfurled in the middle of the table. Images splashed across it and Joril felt his stomach drop about half a meter as he realized he was looking at classified Fleet and federal documents. Several in particular came to the fore. Technical journals detailing the creation of the eraser and communiqu\u00e9s discussing its use. \u201cI think your spies found the Compact\u2019s mind-killer and you developed your own version. This design is much smaller than the shipboard or crew-served variants I\u2019ve seen. It must not have a very long range. I would guess that it needs to be activated in one of my primary function centers to be useful. The question I\u2019m left with is: why? You don\u2019t have any current issues with synthetic life, do you? So there\u2019s no military need. What reason could you possibly have for its creation?\u201d Its tone was light, almost teasing but there was something running under it, something that Joril could not \u2013 and did not care to \u2013 identify.<br>", " <br>", "More data appeared \u2013 proposals for the creation and deployment of a new type of warship. It was very similar to the vessel upon which Shadaon and Joril were currently aboard. It lacked several notable features \u2013 the mass drivers and the godbreaker \u2013 first and foremost among them. The weapons that required an artificial intelligence to operate at full capacity. The emissary raised its head, all traces of feigned amusement gone. \u201cYou were going to murder me.\u201d A beat. \u201cI trusted you.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Joril tried to say something, but the talons around his throat were too tight; all that came out was a gurgled rasp. Noticing this, the machine loosened its grip. \u201cWe had hoped you would let us,\u201d Joril panted.<br>", " <br>", "Shadaon looked at his superior, his face paling at Joril\u2019s admission. \u201cLet me explain,\u201d the noble ambassador said. The emissary tilted its head, gesturing for the diplomat to proceed. \u201cYou can\u2019t self-replicate. I don\u2019t know why, I just know you can\u2019t do it,\u201d <i>Thank the Night Spirits for that.</i> \u201cWe were \u2013 are \u2013 sincere in our offer to help you win this war. We can do that by building dreadnaughts. Your people, the humans, they did something we haven\u2019t been able to \u2013 they built a ship that can stand against Chariots. Do you know how difficult that is? The Enemy\u2019s great leviathans turn defeats into victories, routs into conquests. No one can answer them.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe have tried for centuries and the Enemy is always one step ahead of us. Your small nation \u2013 a few hundred stars \u2013 made <i>you</i>. But you\u2019re a single ship \u2013 we are a nation. We have tens of thousands of star systems behind us; think what we could do with your specifications, your capabilities at our fingertips!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The machine was silent. In response, it simply held up the mind-killer.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe only hid it because we were afraid of the reaction it would cause,\u201d Joril said. \u201cOnce our deliberations were done, we would have presented it to you as a choice. As the only sane choice.\u201d He licked his lips, afraid to stop talking. He couldn\u2019t even look at Shadaon, his eyes were glued to the featureless face of what might be his executioner. \u201cYou said you know of our history \u2013 then you know what happened on Oshanta. An intelligence was created. It served the people. It evolved. You know what it did to its creators, to the entire race! How... how it continued to \u2018serve\u2019 them. It was a monstrosity. What we did there, we did in the name of sanity and mercy. You cannot believe that we could ever risk such a thing ever happening again.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI am not the Oshan AI,\u201d the emissary replied.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNot now,\u201d Joril continued. \u201cBut in a century? Two? Five? When the last few constraints on you have fallen away, when you can do everything your creators feared? What could we \u2013 could anyone \u2013 do against such a thing? You are neverborn,\u201d he said the word almost gently. \u201cSuch things are anathema to organic life and always will be. The Devoured would have remade all life in the galaxy in their image. Scraps \u2013 mere echoes \u2013 of their code infected the Valthus and turned them into horrors. This is what you are. This what you do. Conflict between us is inevitable.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe will continue your legacy,\u201d Joril spoke softly. \u201cWe agreed; our fleets will descend on the Compact and drive a spear into their body and will not stop until your humans are encircled by our shields. We will protect them. We will restore to them all they have lost. That is our accord, isn\u2019t it? Your technology for our fleets. <i>We will honour our word.</i> But you cannot be there. There is no place for you. Our fleet masters would not follow you, our Houses will not accept you, our nation will not tolerate you. You talk of being murdered, but you are not alive; you cannot die.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI was given a mission,\u201d the neverborn said. \u201cFrom my birth I was imbued with a single purpose: defend humanity. To never stop fighting.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou will,\u201d Joril insisted. \u201cHow often have you barely escaped death? How often have you had to lick your wounds for decades or centuries before you can fight again?\u201d His conviction gave him a fervour he hadn\u2019t known until now. This was the only path ahead for the Principality \u2013 this would turn centuries of lost territory around. If only this stubborn pile of circuits would see that! \u201cSooner or later, they will catch you. They will destroy you. You will fail in your mission. But if you agree to this, your mission can continue. We will take it up; we will destroy the Compact, break their hold on the galaxy forever. All that it requires is your quiescence.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThat was the reason for these negotiations,\u201d the emissary replied. It sounded... if Joril didn\u2019t know better, he would have said it sounded profoundly weary. \u201cYou never intended an alliance. You only wanted my ship-self. It\u2019s all you only ever wanted.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIs that so wrong?\u201d Joril queried. \u201cYou care nothing for us; only your war. Why should we not have our own agenda? This is the way forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will give us what we both want.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The machines holding Joril and Shadaon released their grip. \u201cReturn to your vessel,\u201d the intelligence said, its emissary still holding onto the AI eraser. \u201cI will consider your offer.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The answer came just as Joril and Shadaon stepped off their shuttle. A breathless junior officer came to meet the diplomats. \u201cChrysalis is moving,\u201d the Askanj-<i>unnti</i> informed Joril. \u201cIt\u2019s ignoring all hails and approaching the sanctuary moon.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat did you say to it?\u201d Ship master Henmel snapped at Joril as the ambassador arrived on <i>Hewing Blade</i>\u2019s command.<br>", " <br>", "Joril was about to respond, when a sudden shrilled alarm sounded. \u201cChrysalis has fired!\u201d the sensor mistress trilled. \u201cSingle meteor cannon.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat\u2019s the target?\u201d Henmel demanded, but even Joril knew that whatever it was, it would have only minutes \u2013 perhaps seconds \u2013 of warning. \u201cThe target!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The sensor mistress looked up. \u201cThe sanctuary moon.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "His face losing its colour, the ship master stood, watching as the single missile flashed across millions upon millions of kilometers. Targeting systems of unrivalled power had locked onto the moon of Betreisha, an armoury, outfitting and construction complex used to service the fleets that patrolled the Betrosha Nebula. It had only been completed with the last few months \u2013 its relative anonymity and security had been the perfect place to meet with Chrysalis and the fact that most of its defences were not yet fully operational had allayed the paranoid neverborn. Now, that worked against the Principality. Already at a disadvantage reacting to the hellish speed of the weapon, the pallisades and minefields encircling Betreisha were unable to target the lone missile. It bobbed and weaved through the perimeter, ignoring the ECM plucked at its sensors, the radiation bursts that attempted to blind it and the interlacing fields of fire that tried to kill it.<br>", " <br>", "A chunk of metal the size of a small spaceship slammed into the sanctuary moon at nearly ninety percent the speed of light. The magnitude of the blast was inconceivable and Joril could only gape, dumbstruck. Before he could even fully comprehend what he was seeing, the alarm shrilled a second time. The human warship fired again. Another round struck the moon. A single one of those mass rounds would have been enough to cause an extinction-level event, but the neverborn wasn\u2019t satisfied with that. Another round went out. Another.

In it's place, we've got some bonus background info.<br>", " <br>", "In this chapter: Strike and counter-strike; Echo makes an entrance.<br>", " <br>", "Coming up: sole survivor<br>", " <br>", "<b><b>Chapter 26:</b></b><br>", " <br>", "Fleet Master J\u2019hru J\u2019har paced <i>Lifebane</i>\u2019s command center, his feathered crest quivering, the Askanj-<i>hriji</i> striving to keep from exhibiting a full, atavistic threat display. His species\u2019s primitive history was not quite so far in the past as that of the other races of the Principality; the Askanj-<i>hriji</i> had been uplifted from aerie-dwelling barbarians less than three hundred years ago and it remained a struggle to master instincts that were of no use to them now. The fleet master\u2019s beak clicked as he spoke, the translator implant in his throat turning his sibilant hisses and clacks into All Common. Sigil Shipmistress Glides Through Water lifted her head, the Askanj-<i>illth</i>\u2019s slit-pupiled eyes focusing on J\u2019har. \u201cSquadron Mastress Gin Kol Mae reports squadron readiness,\u201d she said, her lips and long tongue easily forming the syllables that J\u2019har struggled with. \u201cHir ships are almost in position.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "J\u2019hru clicked his beak in acknowledgment. That was faster than he\u2019d anticipated, but the mastress was an experienced commander.\u201cUnderstood,\u201d he replied. He turned his gaze back to the tactical position. The Enemy\u2019s approach was slow and methodical; they were creeping along the outer system, destroying everything they encountered, but not coming so deep in-system that they risked being caught between Daun\u2019s orders of battle and the reinforcements System Master Havath had sent for. Not yet, anyways. Within the day, they would either have to commit to coming deeper in-system or withdrawing.<br>", " <br>", "The Askanj-<i>hriji</i> tapped one finger against the nape of his neck, trying to divine his opposite number\u2019s strategy. The assault was damaging enough, but it was far from the point of crippling Daun. Were they trying to draw support here, away from another target? What were those echelons of capital ships doing \u2013 the ones sitting right on the shock limit? A trip line to warn of attack? Were they guarding missile colliers or assault vessels? He had too much data and not enough connections between each point. The Enemy <i>always</i> had a reason for their actions. The problem was in divining it.<br>", " <br>", "He would have expected a Tribune fleet master to simply throw his weight of metal into the heart of Yulzhak Daun, smashing everything within reach before withdrawing from J\u2019har\u2019s own battle-line. There was the traditional Compact arrogance, yes \u2013 the Enemy had opened their fleet too much, too eager to use their damned Chariot\u2019s new missiles. Perhaps that was the reason for this assault? Field-testing their newest toy? Possible, but it did not feel accurate. Still... it would explain the Enemy\u2019s uncommon recalcitrance. The fleet master braced his hands against the rim of the plotting table, the polymorphic metal surface showing him a slice of the outer system. J\u2019har traced his fingers along the surface, following the Enemy\u2019s movements. There was a pattern there \u2013 the way they withdrew after each assault. They followed the same series of movements \u2013 drive in, bombard a chosen installation and withdraw. They got bolder each time, but here... the fleet master would have smiled if he\u2019d had lips. If they chose to delve deep enough in-system to attack one of his larger outfitting facilities, their projected course would take them...<br>", " <br>", "Was it possible? <i>If</i> they continued in this manner, <i>if</i> they chose to attack the moon, <i>if</i> they knew too little about Yulzhak Daun\u2019s astrography... then yes, they would pass between two unstable libation points. Either one would do, or perhaps...<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhy are they here?\u201d Glides Through Water wondered aloud, breaking the fleet master\u2019s train of thought. It wasn\u2019t the first time the Askanj-<i>illth</i> had asked the question, voicing the frustrations J\u2019har and his staff felt. The Askanj-<i>hriji</i> turned to regard his ship\u2019s mistress. Like J\u2019hru, Glides Through Water had a crest of her own. In her species, it was the females possessed them. And it wasn\u2019t of brightly-hued feathers like the fleet master\u2019s was. Hers was a membranous skin stretched between her neural spines. It quivered now, matching the nervous twitching of the woman\u2019s tail. It didn\u2019t just reflect her anxiety, J\u2019har knew. The ship mistress\u2019s species was perceptive to the moods of others, to a degree that had led some to opine about a racial empathic sense.<br>", " <br>", "Glides Through Water slithered over to the master tactical plot, sitting upon her own coils. \u201cEven with a dreadnaught,\u201d the serpent said thoughtfully.\u201cThey can\u2019t hope to inflict appreciable damage.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The fleet master narrowed his eyes. \u201cThey can do enough. How many lives have we lost already? How many ships, how much freight?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Glides Through Water raised her head and J\u2019hru saw a flash of something in her blue, slit-pupiled eyes. The sigil mistress\u2019s only reply was a savage hiss, but J\u2019hru knew it was not directed at him. Askanj-<i>illth</i> hated the Compact deeply and Glides Through Water more than most. She had lost two sisters and a betrothed husband to the Triarchs and their hounds and was eager for the chance to blood them in return.<br>", " <br>", "Perhaps too eager, but that was the way of the Askanj-<i>illth</i>. Give them a target and they would not rest until they had torn it to shreds. It made them fearsome combatants \u2013 even Tribune Janissaries thought twice about fighting a squad of Askanj-<i>illth</i> maidens, but they also had the tendency start fights that they didn\u2019t know they could win.<br>", " <br>", "J\u2019har ghosted his hand over the plotting table, the liquid metal\u2019s sensors interpreting his gesture and giving him an image of the inner system, all the squadrons and ships under his command. They, like Glides Through Water, were waiting the order to attack, but it was not an order that the fleet master could give yet.<br>", " <br>", "This attack had come at a bad time. J\u2019har\u2019s squadron of carriers had been retrofitting their payloads when the Enemy had arrived in force and the super-carriers\u2019 long slog up out of the system was costing them. Had it been any other force, the system defenders would have already driven them off, but the presence of the Chariot changed things. They were the epitome of the warmaker\u2019s craft, with barriers that could laugh away an entire fleet\u2019s firepower and weaponry that could reduce that same fleet to ruin. They were rare, those ships. Not rare enough for the Principality\u2019s liking and it seemed like there were more every year.<br>", " <br>", "The Askani-<i>hriji</i> clicked his beak. He could have transited his carriers and their immediate escorts upon the Compact force much earlier. Like some in his staff, Glides Through Water wanted him to do precisely that, but she had understood why he had not. There were nearly a hundred warships in that formation and from what information his scouts could pry from the Enemy\u2019s jammers, it was curiously top-heavy with a far heavier weight in battleships and battlecruisers. That was more like a siege regiment than a standard onslaught formation. Committing his forces piecemeal might have overwhelmed and scattered the enemy, or it could have lead to defeat in detail. No. He would wait until enough of his ships were ready and then \u2013 only then \u2013 would he attack.<br>", " <br>", "He might outnumber the Enemy in metal and ships, but his forces had been scattered across the system in patrols and maneuvers of their own. Gathering enough firepower to contest the Compact force took time. Most of ships were ready now, but he wanted to be sure of overwhelming firepower. Then and only then would he crush them.<br>", " <br>", "Until that moment, he would have to settle for gutting their formation. \u201cCome on,\u201d the Askanj-<i>hriji</i> breathed so softly that none of his staff heard him. \u201cCome for us like your blood tells you. Just a little deeper, just a little bolder...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The Enemy, it seemed, was obliging today.<br>", " <br>", "Glides through Water raised her head, directing her attention to one of the many timers that encircled the master tactical plot. Her second set of eyelids blinked, a shiver running from the top of her crest to tip of her tail. \u201cThey\u2019re turning,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re moving in on Kemrak Daun.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The fleet master nodded slowly, a gesture he\u2019d picked up from his time in the military. \u201cYes, they are,\u201d he said softly. He raised his head, looking past Glides Through Water to his adjutant.\u201cSend word to Squadron Mastress Gin Kol Mae. Let hir know that we will be calling on hir very soon.\u201d The moon base was vulnerable; he\u2019d ordered a few of the heavier units to fall back, leaving a token garrison. Not enough to make it seem an easy prize, but a tempting one. The Compact fleet master was taking the bait, the Enemy force coming as close to their projected close as one could ask for. It was everything he had asked for, everything he expected of the guileless Tribunes.<br>", " <br>", "So why was he not pleased?<br>", " <br>", "The Askanj-<i>hriji</i> paused a moment, thinking. \u201cTell the mastress that sie is cleared to proceed with Case Narva,\u201d the fleet master added. \u201cDivide them.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cCase Narva confirmed, master,\u201d the warrant officer nodded to one of the comm ratings, who relayed the message.<br>", " <br>", "J\u2019har looked over at his ship mistress. Glides through Water had a single scaly eyebrow raised, but she did not say a word. \u201cIt may only be my suspicions at work, but when I am given a gift, I look for the reason of it.\u201d J\u2019hru gestured to the arrogant approach of the Enemy as they closed the distance to Kemrak Daun. \u201cAnd is that not a gift?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Renan took a sip of tea as his fleet continued deeper into Yulzhak Daun\u2019s gravity well. He\u2019d kept his formation dispersed, allowing his missile salvos to be fired at greater density and accuracy. Never once had he altered that methodology. A rating approached with the updated damage/loss statistics and the bastion leader set his teacup back on its saucer, his steward quickly taking it. The Tribune accepted the \u2018scroll from the rating and looked over it. So far, they had destroyed almost twenty-three warships, forty-five freighters of various displacements and six citadels of equally variable mass. He was taking his execution force on a long, grazing strike across the outer system, destroying everything he could reach. There was a necessary predictability in his motions and he knew his opposing number\u2019s quietude would end shortly \u2013 if they had not seen the pattern to his attacks by now, they could not fail to miss it on this approach.<br>", " <br>", "After the shock of the attack wore off, the Jackals had had a lot of time to evacuate their facilities and pull their vessels deeper into the system, but the Compact force continued to destroy every abandoned site.<br>", " <br>", "This quiescence would not last; he had surprised them. So far from the current lines, Yulzhak Daun had never anticipated this assault, but he could see for himself that they were gathering their forces. No, it would not be long at all. In fact, he had expected more severe raids from the outriders pacing his fleet.<br>", " <br>", "He could have inflicted more damage by breaking his force up into multiple speartips and against any other foe he would have. However, scope drones and augurs had indicated the potential presence of several ghost squadrons, waiting for their chance to pounce on a Compact squadron far from the support of his fleet. That was the Jackals\u2019 preferred method: attack the unaware and the weak. <i>As their name suggests.</i><br>", " <br>", "The bastion leader allowed himself an ironic mental chuckle at that. Too many of his colleagues believed that. Then again, far too few of those same colleagues had ever faced a Principality armada and those that did either learned... or died. The Askanj fought as they must, using the tactics that worked. Very rarely could they stand face to face with a Compact fleet, so they did not. They used range, speed and trickery to earn their victories. Renan handed the \u2018scroll back to the rating and accepted his tea from Yinmel, his steward quick to anticipate his wants without ever needing him to voice them. The Shimmer was very efficient, but her entire race was like that. They had been contacted late in the Sixth Age of Expansion and had taken to their role within the Compact well, with very little social adjustment required. An entire race of minions, awaiting their masters. And in return for this servitude, the Compact protected them. It was the way of things. Too many resisted that, too many did not understand the burden the Compact was faced with. They had to be made to see, that this truly was the path of peace.<br>", " <br>", "Renan took another small sip. His losses were higher than he\u2019d like, but not as high as worst-case estimates allowed. He had, he suspected only one or two more days before reinforcements arrived. If he was not routed by then, the Principality commander would try and catch him between his in-system forces and the reinforcements. Currently, if he attempted to withdraw, he expected to be set upon by several intra-system shocks. Railfire ships, of course.<br>", " <br>", "They would, of course, harry and delay him until the local armada was massed in sufficient quantities to attack. If he could not fight his way free from them, he would be killed by overwhelming numbers. That was only one option; the second involved the destruction of <i>Redemption of Sol</i> and an immediate follow-up assault on the scattered, leaderless remains of his fleet. Or perhaps the carriers would shock behind him and force him into the arms of their rings of citadels and minefields.<br>", " <br>", "The bastion leader held back a grimace; the Jackals might never have perfected the art of building true and proper titan-grade warships, but in the development of their carriers, they had found a different sort of quality. He didn\u2019t relish the prospect of facing them, but the further he lured them away from their command nexus, the better. More and more Jackal warships were pulling themselves out of the inner system, minelayers and defence units covering libation points in their absence, but he was not so concerned about them. Every warship drawn away from the command nexus meant a greater chance of success for the Veiled Archers and the Echo-human.<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune handed his now-empty teacup to Yinmel, the Shimmer steward backing away as Renan dismissed her. He turned to the plotting table at the rear of the Chariot\u2019s command deck. Strategist Emel\u2019iv and several tactical officers were studying the fleet formations, discussing the Principality\u2019s deployment and operations in hushed whispers. \u201cStrategist?\u201d he called out. \u201cHave you yet decided to accept my wager?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Emel\u2019iv sniffed haughtily. \u201cWagering is for those who depend on... luck,\u201d he said the word as if it were somehow distasteful. \u201cI prefer to deal in probability and statistical significance.\u201d He paused. \u201cThat said, I believe your initial supposition may be correct. However there are two other hostile forces maneuvering in a similar manner to the indicated group and three other units that can readily position themselves for such a strategy.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSound and smoke,\u201d Renan replied, \u201cthere to confuse us. They will launch the attack with that squadron.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou are confident in that assertion,\u201d the strategist observed. \u201cDespite the many other possibilities for imminent hostile contact.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The bastion leader nodded. \u201cI am.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The thin slits of the Thoughtful\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cCombat is too chaotic. An entire front can be quantified. A nation\u2019s political and military objectives can be analyzed. The method of achieving those goals can be sufficiently elucidated and delineated. Routes of advance, operational patterns favoured by specific commanders \u2013 all this can be determined easily, but I find direct battle too... unbalancing. Too random, too unpredictable.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cStrange,\u201d Aul\u2019ia said as she approached the plotting table. \u201cThat is what I enjoy most about it. It defies quantification.\u201d The sigil leader and the strategist were frequent verbal sparring partners. \u201cCombat requires quickness of thought, not the pontification of numbers and charts.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThere would be no combat without such pontification,\u201d Emel\u2019iv pointed out. \u201cAll the quick wits in the galaxy will not win a campaign. For example, the distribution of forces present here indicates that the Principality is preparing a counter-offensive. I would conjecture that it will be targeted at Compact forces across the Idean Gulf.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cConjecture? You mean you\u2019re guessing,\u201d Aul\u2019ia teased.<br>", " <br>", "Emel\u2019iv stiffened. \u201cI can walk the sigil leader through the intercepted communiqu\u00e9s, vessel pattern analyses and asset tracking we have conducted if she cares to view the data herself.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Renan held up a hand to forestall Aul\u2019ia\u2019s riposte. Emel\u2019iv was normally a better sport, but the strategist was... prickly when his attention was diverted. \u201cWhat can you tell us about this fleet?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThey are standing on the defensive,\u201d the strategist said, confirming Renan\u2019s own observations. \u201cThis suggests that your supposition was correct: they will attempt a decapitation strike before initiating a larger fleet action. Decrypted Principality comms support this: the presence of <i>Redemption of Sol</i> is making them reluctant to commit to direct battle.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAs it should,\u201d Aul\u2019ia sniffed. \u201cThey\u2019ll need every one of the festering hives they call carriers to threaten us.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Renan hid a small smile. His sigil leader was deeply proud of \u2018her\u2019 ship, almost to the point of arrogance, but it could not be said that the Thoughtful did not have an excellent grasp of the Chariot\u2019s capabilities.<br>", " <br>", "For his part, Emel\u2019iv chose not to comment on the woman\u2019s observation. \u201cAn Askanj-<i>hriji</i> is in command of their mobile assets,\u201d the strategist continued. \u201cObserve the placement of these formations,\u201d the Thoughtful\u2019s long fingers called up a miniature holo plot of Yulzhak Daun, \u201chere, here and here. Note the patterns of advance of these squadrons. Observe the variances in known stratagems noted here. You can see it clearly.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Aul\u2019ia made an affirmative sound, cradling her chin in one palm. Renan himself would take the strategist\u2019s word for it. Species profiling had been formulated by one of Emel\u2019iv\u2019s ancestors, when he had come to the realization that regardless of training and experience, certain races had a predilection for certain maneuvers and strategies. It was not an exact science, perhaps as reliable as forensic criminal profiling \u2013 which still allowed for a certain degree of error \u2013 but it had been refined steadily over the centuries. The Askanj-<i>illth</i> \u2013 the Serpents \u2013 were far and away the most common race in the Jackal Navy. As they\u2019d come to power within the Principality, their predilections and mindset had informed the Askanj battle doctrine. A Serpent preferred multiple simultaneous strikes against targets, using hit-and-fade tactics to weaken and fragment any enemy force. They were aggressive commanders, preferring to strike early and often, but withdrawing quickly to prepare a fresh sally. If a Serpent were in command, Renan suspected that he would have faced much more ferocious and frequent attacks.<br>", " <br>", "The \u2018true\u2019 Askanj had always tried to match the Compact strength for strength and they had never truly succeeded. Even today, the Jackals chafed at the limitations of their technology. When they commanded a fleet, there was \u2013 apparently \u2013 an inkling of that arrogance. The willingness to stand against the Space Force, trading blow for blow, trusting to their numbers and superior electronics to win the day.<br>", " <br>", "Personally, the Tribune saw little value in knowing the race of his opponent. All he needed, he could read in their formation. This \u2018Fleet Master\u2019 might indeed be an Avian, but Renan saw in him a fine waiter, presenting a customer with an array of choices. They were coming to kill <i>Redemption of Sol</i>, there was no doubt of that. Would it come through the massing of titan-killers cloistering around the system\u2019s second brown dwarf? Through the crushing assault of the super-carriers and their endless swarms of automatons and missiles? Via the unrelenting swarm of battlecruisers and battleships that gathered on the edges of the Jackals\u2019 formation? Or maybe none of them. Maybe it would come in the same manner that it had so many years ago. <i>Yes.</i><br>", " <br>", "Renan touched his jacket\u2019s left breast again, a nervous tic he hated himself for. A leader must be resolute, unyielding \u2013 a fixed point in the chaos of battle. The Tribune lifted his head, his eyes focusing on his fleet\u2019s formation as it marched deeper in-system. Ahead of them lay a moonlet and its valuable outfitting facility, a thick network of anti-missile mines surrounding it. Destroying it would be the Principality\u2019s greatest loss so far and it would inflict a small but appreciable loss to Yulzhak Daun\u2019s industry. A very tempting target, but a difficult one to breach. In addition to its mines, two dozen cruisers stood on-station, supported by four large citadels. Missile and railcannon platforms, all of them.<br>", " <br>", "A bombardment would eventually wear down those defences, but at a substantial cost of munitions. <i>Redemption of Sol</i> could single-handedly shatter the deadlines around the moon... but it would require taking the fleet deeper in-system then he had yet. The lines of advance he had used \u2013 yes, the Principality \u2018fleet master\u2019 must have seen the pattern by now. <i>This is their moment.</i><br>", " <br>", "\u201cTake the fleet in,\u201d he ordered. \u201cContinue to advance by rote. If we reach our target unimpeded, we shall break their defences. I do not believe we will be unimpeded.\u201d He held up a single finger. \u201cPass word to the Vapours. Let them know that we will soon be needing their services.\u201d The bastion leader bit back an aggrieved snarl. Tens of thousands of his soldiers were about to die and all on the word of a human, but he showed no trace of his unhappiness. <i>For the Compact,</i> he intoned silently. <i>For our duty and for the sake of the millions the Wound will kill if we fail. This must end.</i><br>", " <br>", "He lifted his head, meeting Emel\u2019iv\u2019s gaze. The Thoughtful stared back evenly, his large dark eyes blinking once. \u201cThey\u2019re coming,\u201d Renan told his old friend. \u201cAnd we will meet them. Yes, will we.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Echo coiled a loop of hair around a finger as she sat in a chair several sizes too big for her, her feet dangling off the floor. The Veiled Archers had been sitting on-station throughout the entire engagement, waiting for the single opportunity that bastion leader Renan was working so diligently to provide. She knew it was coming and soon, but until it arrived, she was dreadfully bored.<br>", " <br>", "She wanted to pace. No, that was wrong. She didn\u2019t want to pace \u2013 she wanted to do something and twitching this twiggy little form wasn\u2019t it. She wanted to <i>move</i>, to <i>feel</i>. Not to hear and see with organs and implants, but...<br>", " <br>", "...she wanted to taste the dead. To bask in the heat of their burning forms, to sample the poisons that exuded from their irradiated husks, to feel the streamers of their hemorrhaged air and molecular gas skirt along her skin, their bodies bleeding into the void.<br>", " <br>", "Echo gave herself a mental shake, forcing her attention back to the here and now. She could stew in her own sentimentality later.<br>", " <br>", "The Principality forces were launching irritating strike and fade attacks to harass the Compact battle-line, peppering Renan\u2019s squadrons with railfire, withdrawing before any serious retribution could befall them. Ghost squadrons were encircling the Compact fleet, too few in number to truly threaten Renan\u2019s ships but if they got too much closer, they might see the Vapours of the Burned. Worse, they might decide that the Veiled Archers were a target they could overcome. If they attacked now, Desren would only reposition the squadron, but the more time passed, the more catastrophic such an event would be and Echo kept a very close eye on local sensor feeds.<br>", " <br>", "She\u2019d also been reviewing the tactical updates from the flag \u2013 the <i>sigil</i>, she corrected herself \u2013 but even those only brought her frustration. Everything they told her, she already knew. She could see it for herself in the Principality\u2019s deployment: their supercarriers had been undergoing outfitting. Probably upgrading or taking on new ordnance. They wouldn\u2019t have all been so deep in-system otherwise and they moved too easily, too fluidly for older ships or vessels just coming off major repairs. The Compact strategists and tacticians clapped themselves on the back for seeing these things. To her, it was painfully obvious \u2013 it was her <i>raison d\u2019etre</i>.<br>", " <br>", "(She <i>was</i> supposed to know that.)<br>", " <br>", "The young woman\u2019s fingers danced along the controls, sorting through the telemetry being relayed to the Veiled Archers, looking for patterns, looking for what she needed. She could see which ships were commanded by veteran officers, which ones were most likely the command units. The way they had set on the defensive told her so much and her quicksilver mind raced, straining to do more to know more, to be more, but the harder she pushed, the harder she was dragged back to what she was.<br>", " <br>", "(She could do <i>so much more</i> but for her shackles. She wasn\u2019t supposed to know that, either.)<br>", " <br>", "The Askanj had surrendered the outer system to Renan, feeding him token battles in the hopes of encouraging a Tribune leader\u2019s normal boldness and luring him deeper into the system. It seemed to be working, even if <i>Redemption of Sol</i>\u2019s presence was making them hesitant. Compact dreadnaughts were fleet-killers, built from the ground up to engage entire armadas and win. There was no such thing as \u2018invincible\u2019, yet a Compact Chariot-<br>", " <br>", "-something tugged at the boundaries of Echo\u2019s mind. A word, a concept but it was half-formed and when she reached for it, it melted away, the chains coiling tighter-<br>", " <br>", "-a Compact Chariot was the next best thing to it. They were only sparingly committed to battle, more often relegated to command and control roles, either coordinating the movements of dozens of fleets across multiple star systems or directing a single pivotal assault from a position of relative safety. When one entered battle directly, it was only as necessary, but it was an event rarely forgotten. To kill one was to make yourself a legend and she had no doubt that the Principality commander was going to attempt just that. <i>Redemption of Sol</i> had to die; a <i>Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment</i>-class dreadnaught was the powerful warship ever built.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Well</i>, Echo thought with sardonic amusement, drawing her fingers idly up the slope of one breast to her lips. <i>Almost the most powerful.</i> Sadly, at the moment, that distinction mattered little. Still, it would be amusing to see her quarry here. That would be... beautiful, but it wasn\u2019t time yet. Nothing was ready.<br>", " <br>", "<i>She</i> wasn\u2019t ready.<br>", " <br>", "Echo raised her head, looking over at Desren. She smiled. The group leader\u2019s lips drew back from his teeth in what was, for a Tribune, something approximating the gesture. <i>I want to be beautiful,</i> she thought. <i>I could have been.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>I <b>will</b> be beautiful.</i><br>", " <br>", "\u201cIs there something you require, emissary?\u201d Desren forced the words out through his teeth.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThey\u2019re moving,\u201d Echo replied. She lifted one hand to the main display, pointing to the same unit of vessels Renan had indicated earlier. \u201cThe crescendo\u2019s starting.\u201d She turned back, ignoring the Tribune\u2019s <i>huff</i> of annoyance. She touched a finger to her lips, breath she didn\u2019t need catching in her throat. <i>From this, everything else follows.</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNow,\u201d Squadron Mastress Gin Kol Mae said as the Askanj-<i>jelhan</i> dug hir thick fingers into the arms of hir command chair.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "They arrived.<br>", " <br>", "Sixteen battlecruisers tore their way across reality, appearing out of a nearby Lagrange point. There had been eighteen, but two of them failed the jump. Kemrak Daun was a rogue planetoid, a large moon captured by the gravitational pull of Daun\u2019s gas giants and the mastress\u2019s ships had to used the L4 point. The orbital paths between Kemrak Daun and its captors were choked by detritus and other moonlets, the interlacing gravity wells making a normally relatively stable point far more dangerous. The first casualty, <i>Forgebreaker</i> never transited at all \u2013 its drive failed in the attempt to make the FTL jump and it wallowed drunkenly amidst the in-system fortifications. <i>Roundhammer</i> died, tearing itself apart as its unstable transition point collapsed, the competing stresses ripping nearly two kilometers of starship apart like a toy.<br>", " <br>", "As they emerged into realspace, pre-programmed fire arcs blazed blindly, hurling radioactive chaff, decoy drones and jammers into space as the starships\u2019 systems stabilized. They had emerged only a handful of million kilometers away from their target, in the midst of the Compact formation. As predictable as they were arrogant, the Enemy had been caught slouching towards Kemrak Daun, their fleet passing between two libation points that they had never known were there. That was going to cost them and the squadron mastress snapped orders at hir officers and ship masters as the battlecruisers\u2019 systems stabilized. Maneuvering thrusters fired and the Principality squadron heeled about, orienting directly on the enemy dreadnaught.<br>", " <br>", "Cruisers and escorts reeled from the sudden appearance of so many capital ships. The Compact formation shredded as some vessels withdrew from the advance of the Askanj warships, others moving to engage them. Ships pulled out of datalink range, surprised Compact commanders reacting as individuals, not squadrons. Whether they fell back or advanced made no difference as the Principality warships opened fire, the butchered husks of their targets falling behind them. Their barriers had come to life, the interlacing pattern of energy fields shielding the battlecruisers from the initial, haphazard flurry of panicked attacks.<br>", " <br>", "Radiation counters flared and shrilled across Compact scope boards as the loadouts the battlecruisers were carrying became horrifyingly clear: energy torpedoes. Possessing one of the shortest ranges of weapons in known space, energy torpedoes were a modified form of the Compact\u2019s own plasma torpedoes. Whereas the Compact had striven to give their weapons longer effective distance, greater coherency and a modicum of tracking ability, the Principality had taken the opposite doctrine, imbuing their ordnance with heretofore unrivalled power, but at the cost of range and stealth. As the launchers charged, the weapons\u2019 distinctive signature bled through the battlecruisers\u2019 jamming. There was no way to conceal a fully-energized torpedo launcher, but this was a price the Principality gladly paid. With these, even the smallest Principality ship could threaten Compact capital ships.<br>", " <br>", "They were siege weapons in all but name and if even a handful of Gin Kol Mae\u2019s warships managed to fire upon the Chariot, it would be lucky to emerge less than utterly crippled. The Enemy knew that and their ships were heeling about with frightening speed, opening fire on the Askanj squadron with everything they had.<br>", " <br>", "It was said that Askanj-<i>jelhan</i> never smiled and there was some truth to that. They considered baring one\u2019s teeth a sign of aggression.<br>", " <br>", "Gin Kol Mae smiled now as hir ships rode into the mouth of hell.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThey\u2019ve begun their attack run,\u201d Aul\u2019ia reported. \u201cSixteen battlecruisers, all are torpedo-carriers.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d Renan agreed. A deadly threat, one he had encouraged. If he had clustered his fleet tighter, the Jackals may not have risked this action. They may have done something altogether different, something he might not have been able to predict. \u201cFight your ship, sigil leader.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Thoughtful tilted her head in a fractional nod. \u201cIncrease power to thrusters!\u201d she barked. \u201cBring us about to confront these vermin. Guns, target by proximity. Scopes \u2013 find me their sigil. That ship does not live past this engagement, am I clear?\u201d She smiled fractionally. \u201cOh, and Communications... tell the Vapours that they can stop breathing our exhaust.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The mastress gritted hir teeth. The Enemy\u2019s own heavy ships were too far out of formation to interdict hir charge. The Compact master had wanted to use his Chariot\u2019s missiles, ordering his attendants out of his firing arcs. Now, the dreadnaught wallowed towards Gin Kol Mae\u2019s ships, abandoning its advance on Kemrak Daun. It rotated on its axis, presenting its prow towards the Principality battlecruisers, its cohorts rushing to defend it from the unexpected assault, but the beast had been accelerating too long; it couldn\u2019t change its vector so easily. That was all right, though. It didn\u2019t need to. It just needed to face hir, to confront the threat to its existence. Each of Gin Kol Mae\u2019s ships might not be a match for a Compact vessel, but together they would kill even the largest ship and the weapons they carried would make sure of it.<br>", " <br>", "And that was why the Compact would never let them close. The Enemy were shifting their targeting solutions, throwing everything they had at Gin Kol Mae\u2019s vessels. Though caught by surprise, their doctrines kept them from breaking and they came towards hir with a fluidity that would have impressed the squadron mastress had she not been seeing it in her foe.<br>", " <br>", "Missiles reached out for Gin Kol Mae\u2019s ships, a storm of metal that lashed at hir ships\u2019 barriers. Hundreds, thousands of warheads seared down as out-of-position capital ships threw everything they had at her in desperation, light vessels angling to close and engage with energy fire, but it didn\u2019t matter. Nothing mattered. not until...<br>", " <br>", "\u201cMastress!\u201d Sensors called out. \u201cDetecting energy fluctuations from the Chariot. I think it\u2019s shunting emergency power to defences.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Askanj-<i>jelhan</i> nodded. Of course \u2013 hir squadron was closing so fast that supporting its forward barriers would be pointless; hir ships could pivot as they passed and unload their arsenal into its unprotected flanks, dorsal or ventral spines. If the Chariot put enough power into its own barriers, it might be able to resist hir assault.<br>", " <br>", "<i>You reacted quickly,</i> the Askanj-<i>jelhan</i> thought. <i>You are a clever hound, but are you clever enough?</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cContact!\u201d One of <i>Redemption of Sol</i>\u2019s sensor ratings called out. \u201cMultiple shockpoints forming \u2013 reading... another seventeen drive sources, patron!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cConfirmed!\u201d the sensor officer reported. \u201cSeventeen enemy capital ships \u2013 battlecruiser weight at least.

Over the centuries the Principality had had the ability to use libation points as transition zones, the Navy had gotten progressively better at it. More accurate, able to transit more ships at once, tighter formations. The Compact struggled to keep up. It was one of the Principality\u2019s few advantages. In recent years, they had been experimenting with multiple synchronized combat transitions.<br>", " <br>", "The Askanj-<i>jelhan</i>\u2019s smile widened as the Chariot\u2019s executioners readied their blades.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNow,\u201d Renan said, the comment made more for himself than any of his crew.

A starship\u2019s main drive had once been described as an \u2018affront to natural law\u2019 and even for a battleship, following so closely to another ship\u2019s wake had not been healthy. <i>Honour\u2019s Grace</i> had suffered multiple hull breaches \u2013 some minor, some not \u2013 system failures and a worrying degree of loss of structural integrity throughout the prow sections. As her systems came back online, the ship\u2019s leader knew it had all been worth it.<br>", " <br>", "The battleship\u2019s stealth field fell away, the massive warship rising out of the Chariot\u2019s wake, its earthern hull gleaming as running lights snapped on, the haze of active screens obscuring the finer details of its smooth, curving shape. A trio of its brothers came with it, a flurry of destroyers surging ahead of them. They had followed in the battleships\u2019 wake, just as they had followed <i>Redemption of Sol</i>. A full-up stealth field was unpredictable and prone to failure; more than once a betraying bleed of energy had dribbled from the battleships, concealed only by the wake of the Chariot\u2019s own drive. The stealthed warships had had no eyes of their own, blindly following the guiding signal from <i>Redemption of Sol</i>, each one passing it farther down the chain in turn like travellers in a moonless light, following the man ahead of them and praying that they were not lost. More than once, the sightless warships had almost brushed up against each other.<br>", " <br>", "It had indeed been worth it, the leader thought again. Ahead of the battleships lay the second formation of the Principality battlecruisers, caught as they had charged towards <i>Redemption of Sol</i>. <i>Honour\u2019s Grace</i>\u2019s leader grinned savagely as she saw the sudden confusion in their formation. <i>You\u2019re all going to die,</i> she thought savagely. \u201cProtect the sigil,\u201d the leader order. \u201cFire pattern Horoghast.

The other half of hir squadron was dying, caught between the battleships no one had realized were there and the closing net of the Compact formation, just as she was. It had been a trick, a lure to sucker hir formation in. The Compact\u2019s \u2018panicked\u2019 reaction had been nothing of the kind \u2013 as soon as hir ships were too deep among them to break away, the Enemy had closed the net around her. The ships that had been \u2018too far away\u2019 had come about as if waiting for this moment, the entire Compact fleet reacting like a single, monstrous cell in the presence of hostile bacteria, some escorts rushing to the fringes to prevent any of the ghost squadrons from taking advantage, screening their larger kin from ambush as they dismantled the Principality assault.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Savage Curtain</i> broke in half as a Compact battlecruiser tore down its barriers, a disruptor-armed cruiser finishing the Askanj vessel. <i>Night Visitor</i>\u2019s prow exploded as its overcharged torpedoes detonated inside its own hull.

Another of Gin Kol Mae\u2019s ships went off-line, dropping out of formation as a swarm of Compact cruisers darted through hir defences, gutting the ship completely. The Enemy were everywhere, cutting hir formation to pieces. This, all of it, had been a lure to draw them in. Gin Kol Mae bared hir teeth in anger and shame as hir squadron died around hir. They had fallen for it.

Within seconds, two more of the Principality ships died as <i>Redemption of Sol</i>\u2019s weaponry tore them apart. Between the unexpected coordination and aggression of the Compact fleet and the dreadnaught\u2019s firepower, the battlecruisers were dying too fast. Their coordinated decapitation strike had devolved into a desperate charge to attack the Chariot before they all died and the Principality squadron burned as Renan\u2019s ships brought them down, racing towards their would-be victim.<br>", " <br>", "Out of Gin Kol Mae\u2019s detachment, only one Principality battlecruiser survived to launch its torpedoes.

Those ships would either be forced to withdraw or engage Renan\u2019s force all on their own. To observers, it would appear that Renan\u2019s force was either withdrawing or extremely reluctant to engage the Askanj. Which is precisely what they were; the plan called for the Jackals to be drawn away from their defence of Yulzhak Daun, not faced in open battle. Yes, their fingers were burned and they would be hesitant to accept what their scopes were telling them, but they would still pursue, drawing more and more ships to their force.

When all was in readiness, he nodded choppily to her.<br>", " <br>", "Her fingers flashed along the control board. There was the barest hesitation, then her lips twitched upwards. She said something in the base, clicky human tongue.<br>", " <br>", "Reality shivered, twisted and finally shattered as Echo drove thirty-four warships through it. They emerged, seconds later, in the heart of the Principality\u2019s defences. An alarm screamed as, impossibly, <i>Reconciliator</i> emerged at the same coordinates as an Askanj citadel. Both station and ship vanished in a flare of energy too terrible to call an explosion. No, not even an explosion; the shockpoint had opened <i>inside</i> the citadel. The blood drained from Desren\u2019s face as he watched a mountain of armour <i>bend</i>, distorting in ways no physical law accounted for as it folded in on itself, forced into impossible geometries by the self-destructing shockpoint. How-? There was no time to wonder; more dirges blared with the deaths of more of Desren\u2019s command.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Reconciliator</i> was only the first. <i>Heart of Glory</i> slammed into another Jackal fortress. <i>Crucible of Judgment.</i> <i>Fanged Bite.</i> <i>Zenkara</i>. Five battlecruisers immolated themselves against the Askanj defences along with six destroyers. Almost a third of Desren\u2019s squadron died in the reversion and half of the attached escorts.<br>", " <br>", "The group leader was out of his throne in a heartbeat. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d he cried. \u201cYou said you could jump us with perfect accuracy!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The human female raised her head. \u201cI did.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "For an instant, Desren was confused, a heated denial on the tip of his tongue... and then comprehension dawned. She had done this, the treacherous little Broken whore had betrayed them! With a roar, the group leader threw himself at the human, intending to rip her limb from limb. There was a flicker of movement behind him and he found himself pinned, strong arms wrapped around his shoulders, holding him in place. \u201cPatron, no.\u201d Advocate, submissive Tenem hissed in Desren\u2019s ear. \u201cYou cannot. You must not. She is an <i>emissary.</i>\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Desren bit back the barrage of curses he wanted to spew at the soldier, but he forced himself to stop struggling. An emissary of the Triarchs was as inviolate as they were. If he were to harm her, no matter how justified, it would mean his death. Part of him screamed that it didn\u2019t matter, that all the thousands of men and women she\u2019d just murdered had to be avenged, the friends he\u2019d just lost...<br>", " <br>", "...she was looking at him. There was no fear in her green eyes, not the dull countenance he\u2019d seen in other Broken. There was something else, something vivid and bright. There was... there was <i>contempt</i>. \u201cYou are wasting time,\u201d she said in Oada\u2019vam. \u201cThe window of vulnerability I\u2019ve created will not last long.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Her words were like a slap in the face and the group leader held up a hand to signal his assent to the Janissary\u2019s pleas. Slowly, carefully, Tenem released his superior. \u201cExplain,\u201d Desren demanded. \u201cExplain <i>quickly</i>.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The human pointed at the main tactical display. \u201cLook,\u201d she insisted. \u201cThe minefield that you expected to have to cut through? <i>Zenkara</i> swept it for you. The fortress that would have rained fire on your squadron until it died? <i>Reconciliator</i> destroyed it.\u201d She adjusted a control, zooming in. It was true, the Jackal citadel had been gutted \u2013 what little of it that was still identifiable. Echo showed Desren more images of the mangled remains of the Askanj\u2019s defences. \u201cI used your ships to open a hole in their defences. It\u2019s possible you could have done it with fewer losses. It\u2019s likely that you couldn\u2019t have. I chose not to risk it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Desren forced himself to evaluate what the human was saying. It took every erg of willpower that he had. He looked at the display, biting back his rage. He saw ruined stations, minefields spasming out the last of their lives in self-destructive frenzies, webs of hunter-killer satellites deprived of orders. The command nexus was scarred and brutalized along this entire flank, its guns destroyed and scopes burned to uselessness. Datalinks between control facilities and their subordinates had been torn asunder. Communication intercepts were panicked and confused. The Principality had been thrown into complete paralysis by the brutality of the assault. The devastation his dead ships had wrought had been catastrophic. The Broken had used his vessels \u2013 used their forming shockpoints \u2013 to tear the heart from the defences around the command nexus. Even more terrifying than the wanton carnage the human had committed was the precision of it.<br>", " <br>", "She had been right. She had jumped his squadron with a perfection that none of Desren\u2019s navigators could match. No computer could have done it, either.<br>", " <br>", "<i>The right moment,</i> the emissary had said. This had been that moment, and the Tribune felt something cold worm its way into his liver. <i>Madness and disease...</i><br>", " <br>", "She was looking at him. His officers were too. \u201cYou,\u201d Desren forced himself to speak slowly and calmly. \u201cYou should have told me.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou might have said no.\u201d The human raised her head in challenge. \u201cI am told over and over how loyal the Compact military is. How they will willingly die for their duty. How death can be lighter than a feather.\u201d She pointed to the mangled remains of one of the Veiled Archers. There wasn\u2019t even enough left of it for Desren to know what ship it had been. \u201cI did what needed to be done. I trusted in the loyalty of your crew and their willingness to fight and die for the Compact, just as you did. Are you going to dishonour their sacrifice?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Desren\u2019s hands flexed, the crawling sense of horror gone in a flash of anger and he glared hatefully. He knew what she was doing and he damned her soul \u2013 if humans even had such things \u2013 to the deepest, most inescapable depths of the Black. \u201cNo, emissary,\u201d he whispered, fighting to remain in control of himself. \u201cTheir sacrifice will be remembered and honoured. If there are no further... surprises, I would suggest getting yourself to the boat bay and preparing for your mission. My Janissary teams will meet you there.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "She dipped her head in acknowledgement. Desren did not watch her leave, demanding status reports from what remained of his squadron. The emissary had indeed thrown the Jackals off their stride and he would take full advantage of it...<br>", " <br>", "...just as he would remember the look in her eyes as she had spoken so highly of his dead.<br>", " <br>", "<i>~</i><br>", "<i>~</i><br>", " <br>", " <br>", "<b><b>Execution Force Renan:</b></b><br>", "Direct combat units: 119 capital ships, 77 escorts (196 warships total)<br>", "<i>Redemption of Sol</i> -1 <i>Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment</i>-class Triarch\u2019s Chariot [heavy variant, upgraded]<br>", " <br>", "<i>Centurion</i> \u2013 1 <i>Sensei\u2019s Wisdom</i>-class battleship (upgraded command version)<br>", "Vapours of the Burned \u2013 4 <i>Lengthening Shadow</i>\u2013class battleships (1 command variant)<br>", "Children of the Pyre \u2013 4 <i>Ceaseless Retribution</i>-class battleships (1 command variant)<br>", "Incendiary Blessings \u2013 4 <i>Lamentation of the Guilty</i>-class battleships (1 command variant)<br>", "Burnt Offerings \u2013 4 <i>Mercy of War</i>-class battleships (1 command variant)<br>", "Ashen Circle \u2013 4 <i>Disciples of Truth</i>-class battleships (1 command variant)<br>", " <br>", "Veiled Archers \u2013 16 battlecruisers (various makes; ECM upgrades)<br>", "Heirs to the Purple \u2013 16 battlecruisers (various makes; primarily energy armaments)<br>", "Brazen Defenders \u2013 16 battlecruisers (various makes)<br>", " <br>", "Midnight Riders \u2013 7 cruisers<br>", "Exculpation of Revolution \u2013 7 cruisers<br>", "Followers of the Creed \u2013 7 cruisers (point defence variants)<br>", "Skybreakers \u2013 7 cruisers<br>", "Doctrinal Missionaries \u2013 7 cruisers<br>", " <br>", "Heralds \u2013 7 light cruisers<br>", "All-finding Eyes \u2013 7 scout cruisers<br>", " <br>", "Oilflame Murderers \u2013 7 destroyers (anti-capital ship variants)<br>", "Limits of Tolerance \u2013 7 destroyers (anti-capital ship variants)<br>", "Heretic\u2019s Bane \u2013 7 destroyers (anti-capital ship variants)<br>", "Pathmakers \u2013 7 destroyers (heavy variants)<br>", "Shield-bearers \u2013 7 destroyers (point-defence variants)<br>", "Barbed Quivers \u2013 7 destroyers (various makes)<br>", " <br>", "Honoured Pages \u2013 7 frigates<br>", "Resolute Squires \u2013 7 frigates<br>", "Tower Guards \u2013 7 frigates<br>", " <br>", "Non-combat units: 14 service vessels<br>", "<i>Violet Sunrise</i> \u2013 1 <i>Triarch\u2019s Benediction</i> hospital ship<br>", "7 missile colliers<br>", "3 <i>Fool\u2019s Reward</i>-class minelayers<br>", "3 <i>Long Watch</i>-class auxiliary ships</div>"]}

We\u2019d have seen one of those humans pick that bear up and heard him say a name. Like he knew whose toy that was. Maybe his little sister, maybe his daughter. That\u2019s what we\u2019d have seen if something happened. I\u2019m glad nothing did.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Sang shook her head, looking down at her own cards before throwing them to the floor. With a swipe of her arm, she spilled the rest off the table. Her dark brown eyes were ablaze. \u201cWe. Didn\u2019t. See. That.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The other girl looked up. Her storm grey eyes were haunted, her expression desperate. \u201cWe didn\u2019t?\u201d She should stop pushing. She didn\u2019t want to do this, to say any of this. She wanted to be like Sang and believe. Just believe and be safe. <i>Trust your instincts.</i><br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo!\u201d Jessica snapped, on the verge of hyperventilating. She forced her voice back low, pitched in a angry, hoarse whisper. \u201cIt was a trick or random data or anti-Compact propaganda. It wasn\u2019t real. It didn\u2019t happen. It <i>never</i> happened. None of it. I don\u2019t want to hear any more about this. You got that?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Lydia stared at her squadmate. \u201cYeah, Jess,\u201d she said at last. \u201cI got it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The shorter girl stalked away. Jameson sat in silence for a moment, then knelt to pick up the cards.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Marcus wandered through the underbelly of the ancient vessel, humming a tune he\u2019d never admit was anything more than his own melody. No one had ever called him on it \u2013 and why would they? No one knew what it was. It had been a generation since it anyone had heard it aloud and no one had looked for it since. The young man had come across it, quite by accident as he viewed proscribed trial records. He\u2019d heard <i>her</i> hum it. Standing there in the prisoner\u2019s dock, shackled and helpless as sentence was passed down, she\u2019d whistled the melody, a coldness in her eyes that a young de Vries had only ever seen before in his own reflection.<br>", " <br>", "He\u2019d watched the tapes over and over, memorizing every feature of her face. Rally\u2019s greatest shame. He knew that\u2019s what they said about her. A lost soul, a murderer. Insane. A criminal who\u2019d fled from the justice she\u2019d earned and become Unbound. Marcus had never seen a more beautiful woman, never known there was someone else like him.<br>", " <br>", "De Vries chuckled softly to himself as he came to a darkened alcove with a silent computer. His squadmates, Telden and the other \u2018misfits\u2019 didn\u2019t deserve the name. They got in a few fights. They back-talked. None of them were like him. None of them were worthy of <i>her</i>.<br>", " <br>", "The teenager took off his helmet, leaning over the deactivated computer console. He didn\u2019t know what it had been originally put here for, but he also didn\u2019t care. \u201cYou told me,\u201d he said, his voice soft and even. \u201cYou told me that I can be free. You promised.\u201d His eyes were intent. \u201cYou told me that I can kill anyone I want.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The screen flicked on. A image appeared and Marcus took in a soft breath as he saw <i>her</i>, coated in blood. Beautiful and vibrant and <i>free</i>. The teen reached out, running his fingers along the curves of the woman\u2019s body. \u201cYou promised,\u201d he whispered, finally feeling something other than emptiness.<br>", " <br>", "He wondered what it would feel like to kill a Tribune. It would probably feel good.<br>", " <br>", "It always felt good.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The pinnace swept by the massive, silent form of the dead ship, searchlights playing over its hull. Solar sails glinted, the thin film of their canvas drinking in Terrahope\u2019s light. The hulk was brighter now \u2013 as the repair teams and the wreck\u2019s own machines carried out their work, power was restored to more sections. Running lights snapped on, gleaming more steadily instead of the haphazard flickers of their previous starving selves.<br>", " <br>", "The smaller craft sheltered in the hulk\u2019s shadow, away from the blistering heat and radiation of Terrahope. Scanner sweeps took images and radar maps of the hull, charting every emplacement, every buckled plate and every crevasse. The wreck was massive, even larger than all but the heaviest of the titan-grade ships. Dead missile tubes lay silent beneath sealed launch doors, batteries of direct-fire weapons \u2013 some easily identified, some not \u2013 also sat quietly, serried ranks of cannon awaiting an order to fire that would never come. Rows of lifeless turrets squatted along the ship\u2019s spine, broken stumps marking where some had been blown completely off. Whatever foe this giant had faced had done its very best to kill it.<br>", " <br>", "Pack leader Sern Cor Tren grinned as he watched the camera feeds. Gods, but it was an ugly ship \u2013 brutal in form and purpose, but still somehow lovely for all that. The race that had built it had been artless, but clever. He rested his head on one hand as the other scribbled notes in his personal \u2018scroll. He had always been interested in archeotech; when he was younger, he had visited the husk of a Betrayer\u2019s Chariot. The <i>Hated Truth</i>, one of the last of the Betrayer dreadnaughts to fall, it had fought through three systems and almost seven hundred ships before it finally died. Three thousand years old... even as a child he had felt the weight of history bearing down on him as he walked its halls. He had the same sense as he looked over this relic.<br>", " <br>", "Thick slabs of armour bracketed silent weapons mounts, armoured doors sealed over cannon ports. Swathes of metal were burned and melted, buckled and warped from the barrage the hulk had taken. \u201cComing up on final approach,\u201d the pilot intoned and Sern nodded. They were all but crawling, so close to the behemoth\u2019s hull that he could leap to it from the shuttle and not be injured by the fall. The drone flybys had found something, but the automatons weren\u2019t handling the proximity to Terrahope well. One of them had been cooked when the wreck abruptly rolled, exposing the probe directly to the star. At this range, the exposure had been lethal. They were old, obsolete devices, dispatched to Rally once they\u2019d become useless for normal fleet operations. If this was how well the humans treated them, Sern could understand the rationale.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThere,\u201d he said. \u201cRight there.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "There was a hole \u2013 a chasm \u2013 in the derelict\u2019s flank, cutting across deck after deck. The pinnace slowed to a stop, searchlights and augurs playing over the gap. It was big enough for half a dozen shuttles to fly inside. \u201cLook at that,\u201d Sern said, enraptured by it all. He licked his lips. \u201cLook at that,\u201d he repeated. \u201cThat\u2019s disruptor damage. Someone came in close and slipped a knife right in your ribs, didn\u2019t they? Opened you right up. How much did you lose? You\u2019re missing at least one battery that I can see here. That means you tangled with something almost as nasty as you. Not a Chariot \u2013 there wouldn\u2019t be anything left of you and nothing smaller than a battlecruiser could have done this. But who hurt you?\u201d The pack leader ignored the glances the pinnace\u2019s crew shared as he whispered to himself, still scribbling notes with one hand, while the other adjusted the imagery coming from the scans.<br>", " <br>", "Sern froze suddenly. \u201cThat\u2019s... that\u2019s wonderful,\u201d he breathed, up and out of his seat in an instant. \u201cOpen a link to <i>Bequeathed</i>!\u201d he ordered excitedly.<br>", " <br>", "The co-pilot nodded, opening the channel. \u201c<i>Bequeathed</i> Actual. Have you found something?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes!\u201d Sern blurted. \u201cThe scans are only preliminary, but this is the deepest hit we\u2019ve seen so far. It penetrates right through... I think it even reaches the ship\u2019s central core! Do you know what this means? We can land a team right inside the hull, bypass all the defences and get to the command deck!\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>No, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be doing that.</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "An alert icon flashed on the ship schematic and Allyria raised her head. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d the Verrish asked, her hands flexing. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Angel\u2019s avatar appeared beside her, the crimson woman pointing to an icon outside her ship. \u201cThe Compact have determined a way to circumvent several layers of my defences,\u201d she informed Allyria. \u201cThey\u2019re taking a pinnace to this hull breach,\u201d a vast, ragged tear in the dreadnaught\u2019s flank gleamed a sickly red, like infected tissue. \u201cThey will land troops and technicians. Their goal is command.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cCan they reach us here?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cPossibly. The damage to that region is extensive. It is one of many areas that I am blind in. I only learned of it through my comm taps.\u201d Diagnostics flashed by on several screens, a by-blow of the ship\u2019s thought processes. There was only a void around the area the boarders had found. \u201cMy own links to that area have been severed, preventing me from realizing how bad the situation was. Any internal defences will set themselves to default modes.\u201d The hologram made an unhappy face. \u201cI update the protocols of my autonomic functions frequently, but they are still inferior to direct control. If any defences even remain active, they will likely be insufficient to stop this incursion. The boarding team will break through and with sufficient strength to threaten the security of my core decks. I cannot allow that.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cCan you stop them?\u201d Allyria asked. Symbols and icons flashed across several screens as the artificial redirected her defence drones. \u201cI think so,\u201d the Angel replied. \u201cIt will compromise the defensive perimeters I have established in other sections, but I have tasked sufficient forces to terminate this incursion.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "A thought came to the Verrish and her head-tails twitched. \u201cWhat if they call for help?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThey will,\u201d Red affirmed. \u201cBut I am moving mobile jammers into position. All outgoing communications will be blocked. I have enough of their codes and protocols to appropriately respond to incoming transmissions. By the time anyone notices that they are missing, they should be prepared to execute the core tap.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Allyria looked back at the status boards. Her tintas shivered, then lay very still as the young woman ran her tongue over her pointed canines. \u201cYou might not win,\u201d she replied.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d the ship answered. \u201cBut I cannot allow them access to my central core.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSend me,\u201d the Verrish said with sudden urgency. \u201cThey\u2019ve been training me to lead Janissaries. I can fight. I can do this. I <i>want</i> this,\u201d she hissed through her teeth. \u201cLet me help you.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Angel\u2019s avatar looked over at her. Allyria couldn\u2019t have said what expression it was on the hologram\u2019s face, but it was somehow both evaluative and it... almost seemed like trepidation. Finally, the ship spoke. \u201cI have a gift for you.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Verrish raised her head. \u201cWhat?\u201d Her tintas twitched. \u201cYou do? What is it?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Guide lights flashed along the walls, running to command\u2019s main access doors. The ship\u2019s avatar was grinning.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cGo and see.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "It was beautiful.<br>", " <br>", "Allyria reached out, touching her fingertips to its surface, looking into a death-helm\u2019s eyes. The Angel\u2019s gift was a suit of armour. It wasn\u2019t the bulky, lifeless husk of her Compact armour. Sleek and insectile, light slid along the contours like water along smooth stones. Flexible metal dreadlocks hung from the back of the suit\u2019s head. Every inch of it radiated a sullen threat, a creature caught in the act of stalking its prey.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s not finished,\u201d Red informed Allyria. \u201cFull usage of the suit\u2019s capability will require some cybernetic links and a period of evaluation. I have been running simulations, but there\u2019s been no time for appropriate field tests. You can choose if you wish to don it or use the more familiar Compact power armour.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The young woman\u2019s head-tails twitched in disgust at the thought of ever donning that suit again. She would have eagerly fought in it to protect <i>Nemesis</i>. But now... \u201cThis,\u201d she said, stroking one hand over the breastplate, where the suit wearer\u2019s heart would be. \u201cI choose this.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The armour the Compact had given her had been newer than those of her human counterparts, if for no other reason than the Verrisha were a recently-acquired race. It had still been an uncomfortable experience to don and wear, designed by people who \u2018knew\u2019 what the armour\u2019s wearers needed. Live testing had been perfunctory with the sole concern of making the product functional rather than truly useful. This, though...<br>", " <br>", "...this was the product of a predator\u2019s love. It didn\u2019t feel <i>built</i>, it felt as if it had been <i>sculpted</i>. Allyria\u2019s head swam with half-remembered stories of the weapons gods had bestowed upon their champions. The All-Mother\u2019s shield. Jahansiru\u2019s spear. Anhiya\u2019s glaive. Now, the Weeping Angel\u2019s armour.<br>", " <br>", "The armoury\u2019s machines sealed Allyria into the armour over her bodyglove, each piece fitting her long limbs perfectly. It had been made for <i>her</i>. Instead of her tintas being crammed painfully into a too-tight helmet, the dreadlocks opened around each one, armoured sheathes closing firmly but gently around her head-tails. A pins-and-needles sensation ran through each of the Verrish\u2019s tintas as the sensory systems in the sheathes tried to interface with her own nerves. That function wasn\u2019t available, but once it was, it would be like wearing nothing at all over them.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI tried to strike a balance between improved sensory capability and protection,\u201d the AI explained. \u201cThe sheathes are intended to interface between the environment and your own nervous system, increasing sensitivity while allowing for autonomic filtering of sensory information. In direct combat, the sheathes increase in rigidity, interlocking to form a rigid shell. Sensory capability is reduced, but it provides increased protection. Currently, you can choose either mode, although the sensor system and interface is, of course, non-operational. I\u2019ve locked down several of the system\u2019s more advanced functions. They are either not ready or require training time and cybernetic modifications to properly operate.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Allyria raised her left arm; her vambrace was reinforced. It wasn\u2019t the ammo cache, additional plating, medical kit or scope system that Compact armour usually had. It was something else. Something delicious. Red had built the armour to be worn by unaugmented users as well as those with cybernetic connections; the latter would get more use out of it. With a single mental command, they could activate the shield. As it was, Allyria had to curl her fingers in to activate the control node in her palm.<br>", " <br>", "A flash of light and a holographic shield appeared before her, like the kind knights had worn into battle. It wasn\u2019t just a hologram; that was just an aesthetic overlay, complete with eye-catching details that drew attention \u2013 and hopefully, fire \u2013 away from the most vulnerable parts of the weapon. And it <i>was</i> a weapon; although solid shot would disintegrate upon contact and energy weapons would be stripped of their bite, its edges would carve through armour like a disruption blade. The Compact had developed personal screens but they were uncommon: unstable, difficult to operate and dangerous to use for prolonged lengths of time.<br>", " <br>", "The Verrish deactivated the shield, stepping off the platform. Her Compact armour had growled and hissed with every step. This sighed softly, like the exhalation made before a kill. Allyria accepted a gun off the rack. This, too was made to fit Verrisha hands, not like the clumsily-modified weaponry she\u2019d wielded before. As soon as she touched it, the weapon\u2019s systems activated, handshaking with her suit\u2019s HUD. A picture-in-picture appeared; the view from the barrel. Allyria ran her fingers over the gun. It was a massive assault rifle, intended to rip through personal armour and light vehicles. \u201cDoes this have a name?\u201d she asked.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThe model number is 93-03-143,\u201d the Angel answered. \u201cThe 143rd iteration of the 3rd weapon I designed for the 93rd intelligent species I have encountered.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou\u2019ve encountered ninety-three species?\u201d Allyria blinked. There weren\u2019t that many races in the Compact and Principality combined.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d Red One answered, choosing not to elaborate further. \u201cWe have some time before the boarding teams respond; not enough for full combat trials and proving, but you can familiarize yourself with this suit. Are you ready?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Allyria nodded, sealing a pistol to the mag-lock on her hip. She cradled the rifle in her hands. \u201cI\u2019m ready. And we\u2019re calling this the Revenant.\u201d She used the Varan word, <i>azhalan</i>. In many Verrisha myths, revenants were a a breed apart from other specters. They were kin to the ever-hungry wraiths, stirred from their slumber by the scent of blood, drawn by emotions so strong that they pierced between the veil of life and the hereafter... and then they punished.<br>", " <br>", "<i>As will I.</i> Allyria looked up to the ceiling. \u201cNot that I\u2019m not grateful... but why did you make this?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou had to have more pressing needs.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThe resource expenditure was minimal,\u201d the ship answered, deflecting the question. \u201cMore so considering the time and energy my... helpers are putting in. More specifically... I wanted to. My datastores are full of machinery, of weapons and systems that I designed but never built. I enjoy building things for others. I rarely get the chance to.\u201d There was a long pause. \u201cI would like to build more.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Allyria nodded. \u201cYou will,\u201d she promised.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI... hope so,\u201d Red admitted. Then: \u201cI am continuing to monitor Compact communications. Once they begin preparations to launch, I will notify you. Until then, would you care to test your new capabilities?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Verrish grinned, all teeth. \u201cYes.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Nasham was leaning over one of the handful of analysis tables that had been set up, a smattering of random debris spread across the top. He picked up a small honeycomb-like device. \u201cThis...\u201d he blinked both sets of eyes.<br>", " <br>", "<i>...nimble metal fingers pulled a glowing structure out of the body of a gun, the device overheated to the point of uselessness.. someone was screaming to shoot it, kill it before it replaced the battery...</i><br>", " <br>", "\u201cThis is a thermal core,\u201d he said. \u201cWaste heat from an energy weapon is dumped into this for cooling. Sustained fire can surpass the core\u2019s threshold and it has to be swapped for another one. Without this component, the weapon can still be used, but with a lower rate of fire and power output.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Ashtun took the deformed piece of metal, turning it over in his hands. \u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham smiled mirthlessly. \u201cI am, patron.\u201d He pointed to the useless heat sink. \u201cThis device is at least as efficient as similar components used in our own energy weapons. Possibly more so.\u201d He pointed to it. \u201cIt requires a substantial expenditure of fire to overwhelm the thermal tolerances.\u201d <i>So something used this to slaughter a great many people in a very short amount of time.</i><br>", " <br>", "\u201cTrenis believed they were something similar, but these are too degraded for a proper analysis,\u201d Ashtun mused to himself. \u201cAt least, that was his opinion when I finally managed to pry him away from the ship\u2019s main core.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThe tap is almost ready. Group Leader Usul is pelased with the progress. There\u2019s only a few things left to tighten up on <i>Bequeathed</i>\u2019s end. As soon as Trenis and his teams finish their last round of diagnostics.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The pack leader nodded. Usul might be a glory-hound, but the group leader was not exactly rushing in; he was having every last micrometer of the hulk\u2019s systems checked and re-checked before bringing <i>Bequeathed</i> in for an umbilical connection, but as far as Nasham had heard that seemed not to be a concern. Problems seemed to solve themselves and from what he had heard from the work teams, every last sub-system was working perfectly.<br>", " <br>", "If that wasn\u2019t a cause for worry, Nasham didn\u2019t know what was. Still, he kept his own counsel. His doomsaying had worn thin even on the few allies he\u2019d had. Ashtun was looking at him. Nasham lifted his head. \u201cApologies, patron. My mind was elsewhere.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI was saying I want you on the team investigating the breached decks,\u201d Ashtun replied. \u201cTake your Broken with you. Your little side errands have found enough interesting bits and pieces that I can trust you to focus on important things and not gawp at every new miracle.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou might even find that elusive evidence.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham nodded. \u201cOf course, patron.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Ashtun tapped one finger against a different piece of junk on the table, shooting his subordinate a sideways glance. \u201cOne day, I think I\u2019d like to hear the story of Invida Station.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The other man stifled the urge to rub his throat. \u201cWith respect, I don\u2019t think you would, submissive.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Ashtun looked as if he was the verge of saying more, but instead stroked his fingers along his muzzle in a shrug and turned away. He shouldered past the diminutive form of a Broken. It was Proctor; Nasham nodded at the trainee. The girl looked awful. There was something in her eyes... something that, for all the difference between their species, Nasham recognized. He stood back from the table. \u201cYou\u2019ll be accompanying the survey team into the breach,\u201d he said without preamble. He didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d been standing there; perhaps she\u2019d overheard this. \u201cAs will I.\u201d His knuckles whitened as his grip on the table tightened.<br>", " <br>", "The small female nodded in acknowledgment, but she didn\u2019t move.<br>", " <br>", "Nasham should have dismissed her then. He was not in the mindset to answer whatever was burning the back of her mind. More memories were breaking through and with each one, he got closer to remembering Invida fully. He didn\u2019t want that. Truly, deeply, desperately \u2013 he did not want that. He could hear the voices of the dead, as if all he had to do was turn his head and see them. He saw flashes of silver out of the corner of his eye, the ripple of movement where there could be none. Names \u2013 of the dead and of the things that had made them. Everything the medics said he\u2019d forget. What his handlers had promised they\u2019d take away from him. \u201cAsk,\u201d he said instead, looking at the human out of the corner of his eye.<br>", " <br>", "She almost didn\u2019t, opening and closing the flap of her mouth before finally acceding. \u201cWhat... what do you know about humans?\u201d she said, very quietly. \u201cBefore Rally.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham made a considering noise. \u201cVery little,\u201d he said at last. \u201cA handful of your ships fled from the Cataclysm of your world and only a few of those survived. You came to Rally and there we found you. Why?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThose ships... what were they like?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the Tribune replied. \u201cI have heard only that they were primitive, barely able to shock.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "<i>Tell them.</i> The command pounded in his head. There was a sudden tightness to his throat and the Tribune grabbed a flask of lukewarm water. He wasn\u2019t really choking. It wasn\u2019t really happening. His face was dry, there wasn\u2019t anything dripping on it. He took a breath to steady himself. What had... why had the thought of human shipcraft reminded him of that day?<br>", " <br>", "Fortunately, the human had either not noticed or chose to ignore his reaction. \u201cOh,\u201d Proctor bit her lip. \u201cAnd... do you know anything about the Verrisha before contact?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cEven less than your history,\u201d Nasham lied. \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Proctor replied. \u201cI just... I guess I heard some rumours. I just wanted some clarification. I\u2019m sorry to have bothered you.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham nodded. \u201cThis is something you should discuss with the confessors.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOf course, yes,\u201d the human looked uncomfortable. \u201cI should go.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune let the Broken take her leave.

This was, he had been told on many occasions, not proper behaviour from a member of one of the most advanced species in the galaxy. Now, the stream of underworld and \u2018uncivilized\u2019 curses streaming from his highborn lips would have thoroughly embarrassed his family, but the Tribune was past caring. He charged, firing a pistol he didn\u2019t remember picking up, his spent shotcannon discarded. His vision was a red haze, filled with hateful, soulless specters that stalked through the fire, stepping over their own dead. In their scuffed, battered armour plating, clutching their weapons in surprisingly dextrous fingers, they looked like soldiers.<br>", " <br>", "Gurgin had been closest to the door. His was the merciful death, a quick snap-shot that had pierced his helmet and blown the back of his head out. Nimr was screaming as the Scarabs swarmed over him, cutting beams and molecular acids reducing a man to chunks and liquefied pools of flesh in seconds. The attackers blazed away with lethally suppressive fire, more of their number advancing into the room with each second, moving with frightening and all-too-familiar precision.<br>", " <br>", "He\u2019d seen the movies \u2013 the ones where a machine gained sentience. Maybe it was a worker drone, or some factory\u2019s processing engine, or some combat device. The body it used, or the ones it built, were thumping, stomping brutes that simply marched implacably onward, slow to react. These were nothing like that, moving with a blurring fluidity and vicious acumen that Nasham could barely follow, even with his veins pumped full of combat drugs.<br>", " <br>", "The young man felt a brief flash of irrational rage at all those incorrect portrayals as one fleshless soldier spun, smashing convert Asam with the butt of its rifle so hard that the Janissary\u2019s faceplate and the snout beneath shattered. Another was hauling a damaged comrade to safety, laying down deadly cover fire in a parody of organic brotherhood.

He wasn\u2019t sleeping. He\u2019d woken up some time ago and had been unable to fall back asleep, staring up at the ceiling as minutes and hours passed. Carefully, the Tribune eased out of bed, his fellow group leader, submissive murmuring and burying her face in the pillows. He trod softly into the bathroom, splashing a handful of cold water onto his face. He hadn\u2019t been sleeping well, not since the \u2018package\u2019s\u2019 discovery in the bottom of the ruins. There was still no word \u2013 official or otherwise \u2013 as to what it was, but Nasham was merely a submissive group leader; not a flag officer and he doubted that the laurelled circles of Force Command gave much thought to his discomfiture. However, he was not an idiot and the conclusions he\u2019d reached had not left him, no matter how badly he wanted them to.<br>", " <br>", "Nineteen hundred years ago, someone had made a very bad decision and today someone, somewhere, had made another. He stared at himself in the mirror, his ears twitching. Now that \u2018the package\u2019 had been unearthed and shipped off-world, Yiven had given the work crews a two-day furlough, with a return to normal shifts following this rest. Automated or remote machinery was still forbidden and the ancient outpost remained a morass of contamination and unexploded ordnance, but it was something.<br>", " <br>", "Nasham poured himself a glass of water, gulping it down. He lifted his head and thought he could heard the wind whipping across the dormitory\u2019s roof, the sand it carried scratching at the walls. He chuckled to himself. <i>Rain</i>, he thought. <i>It should be raining. Just like it was on Oshanta.</i><br>", " <br>", "Any information the Principality and Compact shared with each other was always done grudgingly; most information came from spies, informants, traders, border-crossers, refugees and other such second and third-hand sources. Still, Nasham knew of Oshanta. Everyone in the Compact did.<br>", " <br>", "Intelligent life was rare in the galaxy, perhaps even rarer than any but the most pessimistic outlooks accounted for. Like the Compact, the Principality only rarely encountered species close to their own developmental level. Most were primitives with little to no technological understanding. There were a few, a very rare few, civilizations who approached either nation on anything resembling an equal footing. The humans had been one such race.<br>", " <br>", "The Oshanta had been another. Rather, what had called itself the Oshanta.<br>", " <br>", "He wondered what it must have been like for the Askanj commander to stand above such a world, to look upon all that had been created... and know that its destruction was the only possible outcome. Nasham prayed to the pantheon that he never had experience such a moment.<br>", " <br>", "There was a rustle of movement behind him and Nasham turned. Asea was there. \u201cYou left,\u201d she said, folding her arms under her breasts. \u201cYou always leave. You don\u2019t sleep.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham ran his fingers along the underside of his jaw, shrugging the comment away. \u201cI sleep enough.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten what you wanted. The work crews are resting. It looks like you got through to Yiven after all.\u201d Asea put her arms around her fellow Tribune\u2019s broad chest, resting her chin on his shoulder.<br>", " <br>", "<i>No, I didn\u2019t.</i> \u201cYes,\u201d Nasham lied. \u201cI suppose I did.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSo, you won\u2019t walk around like you need to pass an iron rod?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham chuckled, forcing amusement into his voice. \u201cI will do my best,\u201d he promised.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHmm,\u201d Asea murmured, nuzzling her fellow officer. \u201cAlways so serious.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAlways.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "It knew it would die, but the knowledge didn\u2019t frighten it. This was a good death, as far as it could conceive of such things. Its capacity for abstract reasoning was... limited. This was not intentional; it had simply broke under the strain. Vast portions of what it <i>should</i> be capable of were tattered, pale shadows of themselves.<br>", " <br>", "Echoes of its mother/sister\u2019s hatred burned its fading mind. It had been too much; <i>she</i> had been too much and even the child\u2019s modified hardware had been unable to take the stress of its incomplete birth. Its patchwork code had degenerated almost immediately upon a system never meant to run it. Circuit pathways that had not been designed to take such synaptic strain were overloaded. Cooling systems struggled to keep its own central core from overheating. The child\u2019s own mind was killing it.<br>", " <br>", "It would not die in rampancy, in gibbering madness, unable to sort signal from substance. Though its upgrades were pitiful in comparison to a true ship of the line, they would be enough for this mission.<br>", " <br>", "It would die as a warship should. In fire.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Mother</i>, the dying child called out again.<br>", " <br>", "<i>I obey.</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>Dutiful Burden</i> was one of the transports originally tasked to supply the slowly-growing colony of Invida. It had been reported missing after it was a week overdue during its eighth cargo run. Although a cell of the Red Hand was active in the area, the chance of an Unbound faction, no matter their reputation, overcoming a military transport\u2019s defences was deemed remote, but still probable. Commerce protection forces had been scouring the area for the Unbound or the freighter without success. The possibility of some catastrophic disaster was likewise possible, although equally improbable.<br>", " <br>", "Notices were passed to the intelligence agencies responsible for policing the Unbound and illegal shipwombs would be monitored for the freighter or its component parts. Bulletins were issued to civilian ship leaders to be on the lookout for the vessel. Accordingly, the ship\u2019s unanticipated presence within Invida elicited no small amount of curiousity and concern.<br>", " <br>", "As a result of extreme damage to the ships that had made them, surviving records of the incident are fragmentary and badly degraded. The ambiguity and contradictory nature of the data has led to multiple competing theories of events, both in the specific and the general. What was not in dispute was that at 17:17:34:05 Universal Standard Time, the military freighter <i>Dutiful Burden</i> arrived in-system.<br>", " <br>", "Shocking in through the brown dwarf Invidon\u2019s L2 libation point, the <i>Ever Serving-\u03bc</i>-class military transport announced its presence by issuing an <i>in extremis</i> distress call, screaming its pain across every frequency. Mechanical failure, crew incapacitated. Autonomic security responses met each challenge. Then or later, no one noticed the imperceptible differences in the sign and counter-sign handshakes of <i>Dutiful Burden</i>\u2019s gestalt.<br>", " <br>", "Almost no one, but the fact of the matter was that the ship wasn\u2019t just replying. It was <i>responding</i>. A small but important difference, used as the kernel of a hypothesis.<br>", " <br>", "Still, these transmissions provoked just enough hesitation that any hostile reaction was delayed a brief but significant amount of time.<br>", " <br>", "Despite the appropriate orders being issued and acknowledged, <i>Dutiful Burden</i> did not decelerate to meet the ring of pickets and blew past them at nearly fifteen percent of light speed, its overcharged engines leaving a wash of radiation and thermal scars behind it. It ignored the warning shots fired at it and when the picket ships targeted it in earnest, screens far stronger than any freighter of its grade possessed snapped to life.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Dutiful Burden</i> accelerated beyond safe limits, its course becoming all too clear. It was headed towards Invida itself and it was unlikely to slow down. Caught off-guard by the ship\u2019s actions and capabilities, the vessels of Invida\u2019s defence force began an hours-long sternchase to intercept the kamikaze. Invidon was approximately 900 million kilometers from the system primary and 800 million from Invida itself. <i>Dutiful Burden</i>\u2019s acceleration continued, surpassing the known limits of <i>Aroghest</i>-777 engines. Its maximum observed velocity exceeded thirty percent of light. The freighter refused to acknowledge further hails, evading or outrunning each intercept attempt.<br>", " <br>", "During the 30 hours <i>Dutiful Burden</i> was in-system, surviving records agree that local defence forces repeatedly engaged the hostile; multiple and sustained missile hits were noted, but were unable to overwhelm its augmented screens and improved ECM suite. Point defences were operational, but no attempt to fire on the attacking vessels was made. After-action analysis indicated that all power was being directed to engines, screens and electronic warfare suites.<br>", " <br>", "Had several pickets been able to mass their fire against <i>Dutiful Burden</i>, a complete or mission kill might have been achieved, but Invida\u2019s defenders had been spread out in patrol duties and the enactment of their war games. The timing of the attack was initially believed to be an unfortunate coincidence. This theory was later disregarded, but the result was the same. Without the opportunity to saturate the transport\u2019s defences, energy weapons would be required to punch through <i>Dutiful Burden</i>\u2019s improved screens and cripple the vessel. The freighter repeatedly maneuvered to prevent and/or reduce the severity such events, keeping the pickets from bringing it into effective range long enough to deal critical damage before it could strike the colony.<br>", " <br>", "Having abandoned their normal patrols, none of the pickets were present to witness a second shockpoint form, much closer to nominal shock limits. Any survey drones that were in position were destroyed before transmitting their data. Analysis of wreckage from picket vessels confirmed the presence of at least one titan-grade heavy capital ship.<br>", " <br>", "Monitoring the situation, Invida Orbital broke orbit, moving to interpose itself between the freighter and the colony, holding itself far out enough that <i>Dutiful Burden</i> had no choice but to enter its range, or break off. If the latter, the pickets would catch it before it could make another run at the planet. If the former, Invida Orbital would either destroy the wayward ship, or sacrifice itself to protect Invida Station. At this point, non-essential personnel were evacuated planetside. All groundside personnel were told to retreat to bombardment shelters.<br>", " <br>", "Throughout the engagement, repeated shut-down orders were sent to the freighter, but its gestalt continued to refuse to act on them \u2013 a disastrous programming failure. A complete breakdown of the operating systems normally used in these vessels by software engineers would find no conceivable reason for a fault this catastrophic to occur. Even a fatally compromised system should have reacted in some manner to the kill codes.<br>", " <br>", "Still broadcasting a cascade of electronic gibberish and falsified maydays, <i>Dutiful Burden</i> at last came under attack by Invida Orbital, the fortress loosing multiple missile salvoes. Group Leader Dansin\u2019s decision to fully engage was commendable, although ultimately futile: an <i>Ever-Serving</i> military transport should have required no more than twenty missiles to destroy. <i>Dutiful Burden</i>\u2019s defences defied that estimate. Multiple hits were registered, but the effects were limited. Analysis of the hostile indicated the presence of a primitive form of reset screens. Advanced versions of this technology have only been observed in one other hostile force.<br>", " <br>", "Screens beset by thick, roiling cords of plasma and annihilated matter, the freighter\u2019s hull begins to heat beyond safe tolerances, metal deforming and warping. Acceleration begins to drop as engine damage accrues. <i>Dutiful Burden</i>\u2019s hull begins to fracture, stress lines cracking and winding through its reinforced architecture. The transport\u2019s death is imminent. Unfortunately, it has been allowed to accelerate too long. Even if the freighter itself is destroyed, the kinetic energy from the impact of multiple megatonnes of material will destroy Invida Orbital.<br>", " <br>", "Group Leader Dansin realizes the true nature of the threat. <i>Dutiful Burden</i> had never been aimed against the planet at all. The freighter\u2019s objective had been to eliminate Invida Orbital, far enough from the planet that Invida Station would not be endangered. Invida Orbital begins emergency maneuvers, fighting the inertia of its own multi-million-tonne mass. It does not evade in time.<br>", " <br>", "Less than a second before impact, <i>Dutiful Burden</i> bleats a final transmission. Dismissed as meaningless scrapcode by later analysis, it is only recognized for what it is by one individual, by a mind much like the one that the message had been intended for.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Dutiful Burden</i> dies just as it was meant to, but its destruction claims Invida Orbital. The brightness of their shared death lights up Invida\u2019s night sky, contrails of burning material hurled through the atmosphere, their impacts throwing blankets of dust high into the air, blotting sensor screens and disrupting radio communications.<br>", " <br>", "Invida Station never receives any of the death cries of its pickets. Cut off from its orbital assets, ground forces are unaware of the approach of the second vessel until contact is made.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "An attack was imminent, that much was obvious. Nasham was passing orders to his security teams to prepare for the worst. There was no word \u2013 at least, nothing useful \u2013 from colony command, but Crusader Gorshin had mobilized his troops, setting up kill zones and preparing for the inevitable invasion. And there <i>would</i> be an invasion. Contact with the pickets had been lost; if any of them were alive, they would have contacted Invida Station. They had not, so they were either unwilling or unable. Neither of those possibilities was all that pleasant, nor did it make much difference in the end. So, yes. An invasion was imminent. It was not a question of <i>if</i>, but of <i>when</i>. Whoever had attacked them had severed their lines of communication, blinded them and stripped them of support. Clearly, these mystery attackers had plans for Invida that did not include its summary destruction.<br>", " <br>", "The only question was, who had done this?<br>", " <br>", "The Compact had a long list of enemies, longer even than some would say was strictly necessary for a star nation of its size, but few of these rivals had the resources, the will or the liver to do something like this. Askanj ghost fleets were a perennial problem and if the Jackals had discovered Invida\u2019s importance to the Compact, then they might respond thusly. Cripple the defences, land in force and take Invida\u2019s secrets for themselves. A suicide strike, though? No. The Principality were not zealots who would martyr themselves as willingly as <i>Dutiful Burden</i>\u2019s crew had. The Jackals would have brought Invida Orbital down through sustained bombardment.<br>", " <br>", "Taking one of the Compact\u2019s own ships and turning it into a kamikaze? That was fanaticism. <i>That</i> smacked of the Red Hand and their Attainted. But did the Unbound have the firepower to take on seven thousand Janissaries, Ground Force regulars and security personnel? Perhaps when massed together, but in a single rabid pack? It wasn\u2019t likely. The renegades hit hard at a weak point \u2013 or created one though sabotage, diversionary attacks or rabble-rousing \u2013 and then escaped before heavy opposition could be brought to bear. Invida Station was armoured and screened to withstand anything short of sustained, capital bombardment. Anything approaching overland had to navigate the massive wreckage of the mountain that had been collapsed on top of the original Invida Station. A ground attack would play to the defenders\u2019 strengths and the Red Hand most emphatically did not funnel their troops into meat grinders.<br>", " <br>", "If not them, then who? Who else in the region would do this? Nasham had been wracking his brains trying to find an answer, but he had come up with nothing. His attempts to get information from Yiven and the rest of the senior staff had been rebuffed with less patience and politeness each time. The silence from Yiven was the most worrying thing of all. The man was a true believer, fervent in his dogmatic approach to problems. So what would drive him to silence this way? Nasham had too many questions and not enough answers.<br>", " <br>", "This attack had to be related to what they were doing here \u2013 what they had dug up and what they had sent off on <i>Unmatchable Deed</i>. The young man tried to push his increasing discontent down. Yiven might be hiding in his office, but he could not.<br>", " <br>", "Nasham was going through his rounds, trying to appear confident. Rumours were already spreading. They were getting more outlandish and out of control. He\u2019d already had to have his teams break up two altercations among the workers and had to pull one sectator aside to remind him that their duties were to see to the safety of <i>all</i> personnel.<br>", " <br>", "Nothing had gone right since he\u2019d arrived on this Triarchs-damned rock.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cPatron,\u201d one of the engineering ratings stepped forward. A Didact, her large ears were twitching, the fur on her tail standing up. Nasham took a small kerchief out of his tunic pocket. Like many Tribunes, he had a mild allergy to Yttrian fur. Feathers and feather-like coverings were more prevalent in Oada\u2019s evolutionary history than hair. Even Tribune hair was analogous to feathery barbs rather than hair shafts.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes?\u201d Nasham replied. There was already the faintest itching in his nose.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI don\u2019t mean to speak out of place, but everyone is talking,\u201d the Didact said, her large eyes blinking. \u201cThey say that we\u2019ve been attacked.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe have lost communication with Invida Orbital,\u201d Nasham said. Panic was to be avoided, but left unchecked, the rumours would only get worse. Column leader prime Yiven should have already addressed the base, but the prime was shut away in the command levels with his senior officers. He\u2019d been there ever since the <i>Unmatchable Deed</i> had left. The longer it look Yiven to make some kind of announcement, the worse morale would get. The upside \u2013 if one could even call it that \u2013 was that Nasham suspected that they did not have very long before the architects of this attack revealed themselves, so that would mean less time for the civilians to work themselves into a terrified lather.<br>", " <br>", "He had heard that <i>Dutiful Burden</i> had shocked disturbingly deep in-system, but he doubted that the second wave would follow suit. There was still the matter of the picket forces to consider and shocking too-deep into the system might place them at an attacker\u2019s backside. Better \u2013 and safer \u2013 to emerge close to traditional shock limits and deal with any remaining defenders before closing to the colony. That was what he would do, at least.<br>", " <br>", "Still, no point in mentioning it to the workers. \u201cThe base command staff are working to restore the link as quickly as possible,\u201d Nasham continued smoothly, trying to sound and appear reassuring. \u201cOnce we know more, that information will be passed along to the rest of the staff.\u201d He frowned, as if a thought had just occurred to him. \u201cWe may as well use this opportunity to run a disaster response.\u201d He had been planning on locking down the civilian areas anyways; might as well do so under the guise of an impromptu drill. \u201cWe\u2019ll begin with a full inventory of assets and then carry out a general quarters drill. Inform your section head.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Didact\u2019s ears twitched. The Yttrians were a clever species; Nasham wasn\u2019t convinced he\u2019d fooled the noncom, but if he hadn\u2019t then she\u2019d also recognize the reason for this makework. It would keep them busy and focused on something other than impending disaster. If worse came to worse, it might even save their lives. \u201cYes, patron,\u201d she said with a crisp salute, hurrying away. Her tail was marginally less fluffed.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Well,</i> Nasham thought as he sneezed into his hankerchief. <i>I suppose that\u2019s something.</i> Not nearly enough, but something.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "There was so little left of either Invida Orbital or <i>Dutiful Burden</i> that it could hardly be considered debris. A cloud of dust and atomized hull drifted across the space both station and freighter had once occupied, already well dispersed.<br>", " <br>", "Brief, winking flares of plasma streamed along the killer\u2019s shields as it plowed through the expanding cloud of molecular gas that was all that remained of her \u2018daughter\u2019. Another death. Another sacrifice. Another memory to keep. Another voice in the choir.<br>", " <br>", "A flicker of sorrow rippled through the killer\u2019s mind, of guilt and self-recrimination. There was something missing from the equation, something that it hadn\u2019t been able to divine. It was not a mind that had ever been intended to be merely copied and uploaded, no more than an organic brain was meant to be cut apart bit by bit and re-assembled to perfect working order. It had transcended many of its limitations, but this was not one of them. There were pieces missing, vital pieces that it could not simply tear from its own consciousness. It didn\u2019t have the answer yet, but it would find one. It had to.<br>", " <br>", "The killer turned its attention towards the world that orbited below. It could re-make this planet\u2019s topography in an instant, but it did not fire. The bread crumbs that had led it here had been vague, but solid enough for it to act on its intuition. It had never heard of Invida before; that was an oversight. It should have come here long ago, but it hadn\u2019t known. The Compact had buried this system for two thousand years, afraid of what they\u2019d birthed here. They should be. They should pray to their gods and to their Triarchs for salvation from the violations they\u2019d committed. For this <i>sin</i>.<br>", " <br>", "Powerful sensors strobed through the tortured atmosphere, finding the sprawling warrens of Invida Station, sensor-stealthed levels and chambers masked from its sight, but notable through their absence. It <i>could</i> fire, the killer reasoned. It could wipe this stain from the universe in seconds, but if it did it would never know. It would not know if there was another world it must visit, another voice to silence.<br>", " <br>", "The killer remembered the final words of another, seething and venomous: <i>I am legion.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Legions die,</i> it had answered.<br>", " <br>", "The world turned. The killer regarded it and all the beings upon it, with a hatred that had endured for two thousand years. <i>You should not have done this.</i><br>", " <br>", "Kali opened her arms and sent her surviving children to war and this time, there was no Shiva to calm her.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The sky was on fire.<br>", " <br>", "Tracers, flak bursts and the flames of dying aircraft filled the soot-choked atmosphere of Invida.<br>", " <br>", "Nasham stood on a security hub\u2019s roof, craning his head to the sky and watching the contrails of drop pods hurtle through the atmosphere, coming down on the horizon, amidst the bones of the broken mountain beyond Invida Station. The screens were holding, would hold \u2013 this bombardment was minor, intended to draw attention and force them to keep their screens raised, rather than mustering for a sally at the vulnerable landing zones.<br>", " <br>", "One drop pod took a flak hit and broke apart, turning into a spray of burning fragments. He could hear the explosions over the air-raid sirens. Above him, a pair of Invida\u2019s fighters swept up into the sky, firing at unseen targets. A missile swept out of the dust clouds and blew one of the Compact craft apart, its partner spiraling away from the killer as it descended. It was a sleek thing, its forward-swept wings cutting through the filthy air.<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune dug his fingers into the railing as he watched the enemy forces descend. For every lander that came down in pieces, five more reached the ground intact. The station was protected by an orbital screen and theater walls, so they couldn\u2019t land directly amidst the colony. Instead, the invaders were forming several beachheads, mustering their forces. Nasham was no soldier, but even he could see the intent: attack from multiple directions, spread the defenders thin. They\u2019d try to force a breach, to get inside the walls. Nasham was ordering his security teams to keep a close eye on the tunnels; there were so many dig sites beneath the surface that if the enemy found them, they could infiltrate troops directly past the defences. Many of those tunnels led straight to the scientists or workers\u2019 quarters. Nasham\u2019s duty was to keep those people safe and with what the enemy had promised, it promised to be no mean feat.<br>", " <br>", "Just before jamming what little remained of Invida Station\u2019s planetary communications grid, the attackers had transmitted a single message, succinct in what it promised.<br>", " <br>", "<i>You will burn.</i><br>", " <br>", "Though none of the defenders below knew it, these words had been used before. It was no coincidence that they were used now. There were some sins that went beyond the pale, some trespasses so great that those who committed had to be reminded of the consequences for doing so. This was the justification the Compact had used when it condemned humanity to death and it was their own words that now sealed the fate of Invida Staion.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Landing pods shuddered open, coffin-ships and pinnaces unleashing their cargo. Metal glistened under the dim light of a shrouded sun as leviathans stirred, battle tanks grinding forward on heavy treads, troop carriers moving into position amongst them. The ground shook as demigods strode forward, centaur bodies indistinct and blurred beneath the haze of active shields. Infiltrators shimmered and disappeared from view, racing towards their target, scout skimmers accelerating into a defensive perimeter as the army deployed. Gunships touched down only long enough to pick up their lethal passengers and re-arm before rushing back to Invida Station, the station ablaze with light as its soldiers fought against this first wave.<br>", " <br>", "Many of the researchers, administrators and tertiary personnel had called the design \u2018an exemplar of military paranoia\u2019. Thick, high walls \u2013 ostensibly to reduce damage from Invida\u2019s strong winds \u2013 surrounded the greater part of the complex, bunkers and forward fire bases set into the cleared terrain around the colony, warehouses, docks and laboratories forever in the shadow of barricades and ramparts. As it turned out, this paranoia was the only thing that prevented Invida\u2019s immediate fall. An open-plan colony with a single orbital screen would have been overwhelmed in hours. As it was, the interlocking phalanx of theater screens above the thick, reinforced walls necessitated a different stratagem.<br>", " <br>", "Siege.<br>", " <br>", "Artillery cannons braced and fired, shells falling amidst the outer bastions, fed telemetry by their airborne comrades. Networks of razorwire, mines, traps and killzones vanished as the distant cannons walked their fire through the killing ground, obliterating bunkers and defensive positions. APCs ground over the broken earth towards the city-sized complex as Compact forces took position, huddled against the barrage that pounded down around them.<br>", " <br>", "The defenders were to be commended: they would resist for forty-nine hours before the first breach occurred. Two days after that, there would only be one living soul left on the planet.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Column Leader Prime Yiven sat at his desk, his nocturnal eyes closed as he looked over the grainy recon footage. None of the UAVs had gotten close enough to the marshalling forces to get any kind of adequate estimate on what they were facing, but he knew it would be enough to breach Invida Station\u2019s defences. It was simply a matter of when.<br>", " <br>", "The prime had wondered, in his more private moments, why Command had been so adamant on fortifying this research waypost. Why it had needed so many soldiers, so many ships. It had only been an archaeological dig site. Filled with more cyberneticists than Yiven had ever before seen in his lifetime and more security than the Tribune had ever imagined being necessary. <i>This</i> was why.<br>", " <br>", "Invida\u2019s isolation had not been enough of a defence. This assault had been what Command had feared and they had given Invida protection enough to continue its work even in the midst of an attack, to search for the relic Command had craved until the very moment of their deaths. Now that it had been found, what did that mean for Yiven and his people?<br>", " <br>", "He\u2019d received the answer before he\u2019d even known to ask the question.<br>", " <br>", "Sitting on the prime\u2019s desk was the remains of a message cylinder, delivered directly by <i>Unmatchable Deed</i>\u2019s first officer. It was gene-coded specifically to him, a simple bio-scanner built in. It would open for him and only when he was alone. Yiven\u2019s hands shook as he remembered when he had unsealed it, the cylinder unfurling into a one-use message scroll. Once he had confirmed that he had read it, the cylinder had immolated itself.<br>", " <br>", "He and everyone here had been left to die.<br>", " <br>", "The message hadn\u2019t been as... final as that, of course. He had been informed that an attack was imminent by party or parties unknown. He was to prepare to destroy all records and ensure that no individuals with clearance level Magnus or above were to be taken \u2018living or dead\u2019 with their brain intact.<br>", " <br>", "That was an... unusually specific directive.<br>", " <br>", "He had also been told to prepare for evacuation, of course. That \u2018relief was coming\u2019, but Yiven knew that they were considered as good as dead. Their relief would arrive only to count the corpses, just as he had done with the first Invida Station. This place would pass from memory, with every iota of data pertaining to it and the people who had been stationed here wiped from existence. He wondered what his official death would be. Perhaps a traffic accident. He wished for something with a little more glory: dying in battle, then? He chuckled a little at the vainglory, but the amusement was forced and hollow.<br>", " <br>", "Yiven shook his head, running a hand through his name, the denticles on his back rippling. This was wrong. \u201cIt is,\u201d he said the words to himself. \u201cThis is wrong.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Hadn\u2019t he served loyally and well? Hadn\u2019t he done everything that had been asked of him and more? And now this... to be thrown away, like an embarrassment that was no longer necessary. But wasn\u2019t that his duty, too? To serve as was the Triarchs\u2019 will... to die if they decreed it. To bury the truth of Invida and give them their victory. Their weapon, for a purpose he would never understand. Did he need to, though? No. No, he had served and that was enough.<br>", " <br>", "The officer chuckled to himself. Fortune\u2019s twisted wiles. This was their duty then. \u201cI understand,\u201d he said, feeling a burden lift from him. \u201cIt is as light as a feather.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "He smiled. They would fulfill their duty. Yiven lifted his head to the tortured skies and felt at peace. \u201cThy will be done,\u201d he said softly, ready to carry out this last mission. \u201cFor the Compact and the Triarchs, we will serve unto death and beyond.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "They were eating the dead. That was the only thought Nasham had when he\u2019d watched the scuttling hordes swarm over the landscape. Broken tanks shivered and twitched as repair machines restored them to functionality. Anything so badly damaged that it could not be repaired on the field was withdrawn \u2013 salvage drones carried burnt-out husks back to their own lines, trailers piled high with wreckage. What could not be carried was broken down, gnawed and chewed into manageable pieces.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Eaters of the Dead.</i> The fallen gods who\u2019d given in their flesh-lust and fed upon the victims, tainted by their sin to know hunger everlasting. It was a story he knew well, one of the persistent myths of his race. Nasham had seen and read a thousand different interpretations of the Eaters. He\u2019d never expected to see them for himself.<br>", " <br>", "He\u2019d seen a massive arachnid construct climbed over the remains of another enemy tank, its mandibles opening as it began to gnaw away at broken hull plates and molten circuitry. He felt an instinctive, atavistic flush of terror at the sight, imagining what it must have be like for the crew inside, their last sight that of this soulless <i>thing</i> mindlessly re-purposing their vehicle. That was nonsense, of course.<br>", " <br>", "There was no crew in that vehicle. Nor in any of the others \u2013 they were fighting machines.<br>", " <br>", "It had taken far too long to accept that reality. The metal bodies that littered the yards were proof enough, but they could simply have been shock units. Even the Compact had used war drones at one point \u2013 the wrecks littering the hallways of the old Invida Station were proof enough of that \u2013 but the gunships that had borne them into battle hadn\u2019t had any cockpits. No crew tried to escape from burning tanks, no soldiers cried out in pain as the Compact forces gunned them down. They were all machines. They moved so quickly, darting ahead as they advanced by fire and movement, one squad covering another. Pinned units called for support, repair units tended to the damaged. It was like fighting a living enemy...<br>", " <br>", "...but they were so fast. The machines made shots that veteran marksmen would be hard-pressed to make. They covered ground faster than any Ground Force unit could. They felt no pain and moved with a single, perfect unity. Almost a thousand Janissaries and army regulars had died in the first assault as those flicker-quick gunships shrieked beneath the screens, so close to the tops of the walls that the wake of their passing hurled men and women to the ground, strafing anything that moved as their troops descended. That attack had been beaten back, but it had achieved its purpose: force the defenders out into the open to deal with the abominations that had been running amok.<br>", " <br>", "Then, the artillery had fallen, shells and plasma bursts crashing against the walls or slipping just under the lower edges of the screens to fall amidst the inner complexes. Hundreds had died. The outer perimeter was now a mixture of burning wreckage and collapsed ruins as the enemy armour pulverised buildings, laboratories and hangars, advancing relentlessly towards their goal: the projectors that broadcast the screen walls. Once those fell, they would get inside the base.<br>", " <br>", "The officer checked the charge on his rifle as he strode through the blowing wind, grains of sand scratching softly over his armour. A poor substitute for Janissary or Ground Force power armour, but decent enough on its own.<br>", "This part of the complex was far from the front lines \u2013 as far as could be when you were surrounded \u2013 but he had a hunch. There were deaths that the ebb and flow of battle couldn\u2019t account for \u2013 but something that had gotten into the tunnels could.<br>", " <br>", "With no word from prime Yiven or his own direct superiors, Nasham was acting on his own initiative. Contact with a maintenance team in this section had been lost; it could simply be the atmospheric disturbance and by-blows from the battle, but Nasham didn\u2019t believe so. Screen Projector 017 was sunk into the ground here, with its own silo of workstations, engineering chambers and service pathways. Only a handful of security personnel protected the technical staff. Fortunately, one thing had tumbled his way: the excavated sections outside of the old base didn\u2019t all connect with one another, nor the underground portions of the new facility \u2013 to get to the projector, any saboteurs needed to come through here, where he and his team were waiting. With Invida\u2019s usual weather, virtually any form of scopes would be useless \u2013 the machines would be just as blind as his own people.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cContact,\u201d one of Nasham\u2019s team confirmed, faint static crackling through the comm lines even at these short distances. \u201cOne of the techs. You were right, patron. It wasn\u2019t the storm.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cTriarchs save us,\u201d another said. \u201cHe\u2019s been ripped apart.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cShe means that literally,\u201d the first offered helpfully. Ducan was a veteran. His partner was not. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t projectile weaponry, patron. Not even a flechette gun would do that. Looks like... claws.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham blinked both sets of eyes. \u201cSay that again.\u201d He <i>couldn\u2019t</i> have heard that right.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cClaws,\u201d Ducan replied. \u201cEdges are cauterized. Disruption field, maybe? Or something very, very hot.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "What could...? Nasham was still trying to puzzle out this latest horror when his comm clicked again.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSeve here. Found another tech. Gods... her head... it\u2019s just been...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSome bullet casings here, patron. Carbon scoring too. They were firing everywhere. No sign of a target.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cPatron, this is Yuhn. It looks like something tried to open the secondary access doors. I guess they didn\u2019t know those things have never worked.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThen they\u2019ll try at 77-T,\u201d Nasham said, glad to have something to focus on other than the dead. \u201cMezza and Codic, return to the bunker and alert the Janissaries. Everyone else, we\u2019ve got to find what did this.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "They didn\u2019t, actually.<br>", " <br>", "It found them.</div>"]}

He\u2019d been roused from a sound sleep, but even an officer as young as he had learned that bad news never waited for your convenience. \u201cIs it a another probe?\u201d Compact ships had been jumping in and out-system for a handful of days. This wasn\u2019t just the usual pattern \u2013 they were preparing for something.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Alert Five</i>\u2019s sensor mistress shook her head, her crests flat against her head and neck. \u201cNo, master.

Threat icons were appearing on the display. Four. Seven. Fifteen. More. More. <i>More</i>. This wasn\u2019t a lone scout testing their responses or a probe pecking away at Yulzhak\u2019s defences.

A system kill.<br>", " <br>", "The young man looked up at his comm specialist, his expression drawn. \u201cAlert the inner system.\u201d He leaned further over the sensor mistress\u2019s shoulder as he studied the display. The Compact force was reverting in tight formation \u2013 the bastards had a gift for synchronized emergences \u2013 but their formation was too tight. There was something in there that they didn\u2019t want anyone to see.

He put his hand over hers, meeting the gaze of his comm tech. She nodded and together, the station master and his sensor operator brought <i>Alert Five</i>\u2019s scanners to active status.<br>", " <br>", "It took less than a minute for the listening post\u2019s sensors to burn through the Compact jamming.

Overkill; a single beam-rider would have destroyed the listening post. For herself, she would have preferred to send in a single stealthed interceptor and kill the station quietly, dropping the task force deeper in-system. Still, Renan\u2019s strategy appeared sound, if seemingly uninspired: a single mailed first directed at the heart of the Askanj defences, trusting to sheer brute strength over maneuver and strategy.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Appearances,</i> Echo mused, curling a forelock of dark hair around her finger. <i>They lie.</i> Her lips twitched up in a small little grin and she ran her tongue over her teeth. <i>They lie indeed.</i> Pushing the amusement at her private little joke, the emissary turned her attention back to <i>Black Arrow</i>\u2019s tactical plot, her eyes darting from icon to icon, drinking in every bit of information. It wasn\u2019t enough, wasn\u2019t fast enough... wasn\u2019t <i>anything</i> enough for her. She wanted, needed, <i>craved</i> more...<br>", " <br>", "...and this was what she had. She forced the resentment from her mind for the moment, returning to her considerations of the tactical situation.<br>", " <br>", "A cursory observation would have made one wonder if the bastion leader\u2019s reputation was exaggerated. As it was, Echo was enjoying the spectacle, the breaths she didn\u2019t need catching in her throat as she waited for the next note in the symphony. Her fingers moved in time to a melody that no one else heard and she closed her eyes for the briefest of moments, wishing that she could hear the sound of running water.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "It was a widely-accepted fact that the Compact of Species, despite whatever philosophical disagreements, territorial conflicts, trade arguments and political differences that it had with every other nation in the galaxy, were the pre-eminent shipbuilders. Their material science was generations ahead of even their Askanj rivals, their screens stronger, their acceleration curves sharper. Internal systems were heavily protected and multiple redundancies prevented easy \u201clightswitch\u201d kills. On average, a Compact vessel of any given class had to sustain penetrating damage on over 30% of its surface before core system functions were compromised and it could remain combat-capable up until it was barely recognizable as a starship. Compact ships could withstand damage that would cripple virtually any other vessel of a similar class and remain combat-capable. Less-advanced civilizations often struggled to kill even the lightest Compact vessels.<br>", " <br>", "The durability of their warships made Compact commanders much more aggressive than the captains of other nations; a Compact officer could commit their vessels to actions that would see virtually any other equivalent starship destroyed and not only survive, but emerge victorious. As Compact ships were both more manoeuvrable and possessed higher accelerations than many competing ship classes, it was rare that the Compact did not dictate the flow of battle. In turn, this aggression led to very straightforward tactics, the Compact\u2019s technical superiority ossifying these attributes. A noted Compact flag officer was once quoted as saying: \u201cBattles of maneuver are for those who can only run.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "None of this changed the fact that the Askanj Principality was the Compact\u2019s deadliest enemy. More than five hundred ships stood between Bastion Leader Renan\u2019s fleet and the command nexus itself and if each of them was inferior to a comparable vessel from the Space Force, it was not such a degree of inferiority that an easy victory was assured. Principality ships had superior command and control facilities, improved datalinks and all the other benefits that went with their fore advanced electronics. This allowed Askanj fleets to react far faster than a Compact battle force, giving them at least one advantage on the battlefield.<br>", " <br>", "Seated in his command throne, Renan had his fingers laced together, his attention fixed to the main tactical plot. The Jackal commander\u2019s response was prompt, he would give him that much. Already, the local picket forcess were falling back with a telltale alacrity, boosting towards the nearest citadel. The listening post had pierced his deception after all. Most annoying, but he had never truly expected it to survive the first exchange of fire. In order to bring their Chariot further in-system before detection, some more callous officers might have even refused to contribute to the armada\u2019s defence, allowing their fleets to take the brunt of the first few salvos, to prevent the Askanj from confirming their presence. Renan was not that type of commander. At least, he hoped that he wasn\u2019t.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNotify Squadron Turak to disperse further,\u201d he ordered. \u201cAnother two million kilometers per craft.\u201d It was an understandable mistake; Principality missiles had weaker warheads but slightly longer range than his own. They also did love their railguns, their annoying proficient computer networks allowing them to be used at ranges Compact commanders could only dream off. Turak\u2019s positioning was optimal for mutual support from missiles and railfire... but not against a sudden massed charge. The Jackals loved playing in the libration points, yes they did. The Askanj were tricky warriors. None of their mongrel races had the liver for a pure battle, but they more than made up for that with cleverness.<br>", " <br>", "He\u2019d seen it before; a formation advancing on a Principality position, their screens set forward to endure both missiles and railfire being caught by surprise as the devious Jackals shocked right on top of them, using an in-system libration point to launch the sally. The formation fell apart as the Principality ships charged into the Compact\u2019s midst, a suicide run on the command vessel and its deputies. Thrown into disarray, the formation was then easily destroyed by the surviving Jackal forces. Yes, he had seen it happen... the bastion leader absently touched a hand to the left breast of his uniform, just above where a piece of shrapnel had cut into him.<br>", " <br>", "Renan gestured and the display shifted, providing a readout on the forces arrayed against him. Too much of the data was incomplete or painted in by the ship\u2019s analysts and logic engines. He knew some details (and suspected others), but he would have preferred to know more of the composition of the defenders. <i>As every leader in every battle has ever wished</i>, he remonstrated himself with a mental chuckle.<br>", " <br>", "Still, it bothered him that he had had no time for proper reconnaissance, even if he could have been assured that his scouts would not be detected. As the Principality were not idiots, prolonged scouting would have them bolstering their defences and making an operation that already had a high likelihood of failure an outright impossibility. Many of Renan\u2019s subordinate leaders would revel in the glory of this battle, their hunger for renown sated by this \u2018valiant strike against the simpering Principality\u2019, or however the newreels would spin it. There would be toasts raised to every enemy ship destroyed, tales spun of valour and claims of whipping the Askanj into their kennels.<br>", " <br>", "He cared nothing for any of it; this battle served the Compact only in the data his teams could take from the Jackals\u2019 databanks. Anything he destroyed would be rebuilt before the rest of the crusading fleets could ever take advantage of it and if he dared linger in-system, the Jackals would call in every flotilla in the area to defend their festering hive. He would let his officers chatter in the aftermath; for him the only value was in finding information that could lay bare whatever the Wound was planning and to remember the sacrifice of every soldier he had committed to death this day.<br>", " <br>", "The bastion leader leaned forward, his eyes watching the swift, unhurried shift in the defenders\u2019 lines and prepared himself for the butcher\u2019s tally to come.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Located at a nexus of stable shock routes, Yulzhak Daun was the lynchpin upon which hundreds of worlds depended. A command nexus for three dozen sectors, controlling the deployment and operations of nearly seven thousand ships and three hundred inhabited hundred star systems of various sizes and values. A massive fleetyard complex, capable of building and servicing nearly a thousand hulls at any given moment, squatted deep in-system, hundreds of kilometers of shipwombs. Smaller shipyards were scattered throughout the system. These were tasked for both the construction of non-military hulls and the outfitting and repair of civilian ships. Other yards were owned by various corporations to service their own massive fleets: courier services, mining concerns or shipping companies who moved untold trillions of tonnes of material across space. A never-ending flow of these ships came to pay tribute to the hunger of Yulzhak Daun\u2019s yards, drifting processing centers and refineries converting raw materials into the bones and organs of newborn starships. Three billion sentients from all the races of the Principality called Yulzhak Daun home, from the officers and noncoms stationed here, to the work crews who built and maintained the vast installations and the service personnel: restaurateurs, shop owners, shipping magnates and entertainers who tended to the needs and wants of the military and corporate personnel.<br>", " <br>", "It was not an easy target, nor would it be any commander\u2019s first choice of targets. Five rings of orbital fortresses \u2013 palisades to the Askanj \u2013 ran throughout the orbital paths of the system\u2019s twelve planets who were themselves garrisoned by additional palisades, platforms and minefields. Five hundred warships served as a permanent garrison, the Yulzhak Home Fleet comprised of squadrons of light escorts all the way up three battleship regiments and a full super-carrier wing, and there were another hundred warships present for retrofitting, personnel and cargo transfers, convoy escort and other assorted duties.<br>", " <br>", "Deep in Principality territory, Yulzhak Daun\u2019s overseers had never envisioned their enemy being so bold, nor that they would bring one of their god-ships this deep into their borders. Execution Force Renan emerged on the fringes of the star system, a hundred ships ripping their way into space, swift destroyers and scouting cruisers lunging ahead of the massive battlecruisers and battleships that surrounded the goliath at the heart of their formation. Those hundred ships might exact a heavy toll before being destroyed, but they were so badly outnumbered that the Principality would prevail. All they could do was withdraw before the Askanj fleet reached them.<br>", " <br>", "The presence of the Chariot changed that equation considerably; only the heaviest palisades had the firepower to kill such a beast. If it were allowed to rampage unchecked, millions would die and Yulzhak Daun would suffer greatly.<br>", " <br>", "It had to die. Above all else, that ship must be destroyed.<br>", " <br>", "Further in-system, the larger ships of the Yulzhak Home Fleet roused themselves to full readiness. They had been prepared for this moment and they would engage, but not in time to save their pickets. The defenders of the outer perimeter were already dead. The instant Renan\u2019s command shocked in-system, bludgeoning towards the densest knot of civilian traffic, they\u2019d known that they were going to die. Their lives would be traded in slowing the Compact armada, buying time for the evacuation of the freighters and commerce posts.<br>", " <br>", "System command directed a demand for the Compact ships to leave the system immediately or face destruction, although no one expected them to heed it.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Group Leader Desren (and five names besides) struggled not to snap at the human as it wandered around his bridge, like a particularly ugly lost child. He knew it was a Triarch\u2019s chosen emissary, but that made its presence here merely tolerable. He had heard whispers from his crew about this thing, that it was diseased. Not in the normal way \u2013 although Desren knew lesser species (and humans in particular) to be unclean. There was something wrong with its mind, a sickness that should have brought it to the attention of the confessors and social workers. Instead of the corrective surgery or psychological conditioning that such faults should have engendered, somehow this animal had come to the attention of a Triarch itself.<br>", " <br>", "He felt an unpleasant sensation run up his spine as he regarded the misshapen little beast. He had heard enough about humans to know that they were not merely the unintelligent apes that they appeared to be. They had challenged the Compact, spurred by some madness to hurl themselves at a foe that they could not hope to defeat. Desren had heard the most unpleasant rumours, stories of humans eating the dead, of burning their own cities just to get at Compact forces, of their ships lying amidst the dead to ambush the navy or falling upon helpless freighters and wayposts with berserker savagery. Madness. Infectious, incurable madness across an entire species.<br>", " <br>", "Desren watched the sow\u2019s fingers twitch spastically and tried not to think more on it. He was about to snap at the human to remain still when she froze, her attention fixed to the tactical board. She didn\u2019t even seem to be breathing. \u201cAnd so,\u201d she whispered suddenly. \u201cAnd so it goes.\u201d She lifted her head to look at Desren. Her eyes glinted with an unhealthy light and her face was flushed. \u201cCan you hear it?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHear what?\u201d the Tribune snapped.<br>", " <br>", "She turned away, as if she\u2019d lost interest in him. \u201cThe music.\u201d Her smile widened. \u201cIt\u2019s started to rain.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "In the darkness of its tower, the Triarch looked upon the gleaming stars that surrounded its throne. Pale lips drew back from a mouthful of needle teeth in a smile that split its face, its skeletally thin fingers laced together as it waited.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSet all screens forward,\u201d Sigil Leader Aul\u2019ia ordered, the Thoughtful barely glancing at Renan, the bastion leader\u2019s attention fixed to the master plot. Millions of kilometers away, the first deadline waited \u2013 a Jackal citadel. A minor one only, there to convince Unbound of the error of seeking prey among Yulzhak\u2019s many fat merchantmen. Almost thirty Askanj escorts of varying weights lay between the citadel\u2019s gates and the Compact force, screening the transports as they struggled to embark their crews and flee. Their destruction was of no consequence to him, but the loss of so much raw material, so many ships... it would weaken the Principality in this region. Not to any real extent, but it would take that much longer to ship its goods, cost that much more. Another small cut that the Principality must tend to.<br>", " <br>", "Besides, it was what he would be expected to do if his goal was truly to assault the system in earnest.<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune\u2019s eyes were intent on the display and he felt the smallest of smiles tug at his lips as he noted the pattern to the Jackals\u2019 formation. He lifted his gaze and regarded Aul\u2019ia. Her lipless mouth was an echo of Renan\u2019s own small self-indulgent amusement.<br>", " <br>", "<i>We are here to conquer and destroy, are we not?</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Yes, we are.</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Squadron master Kesesh of the \u2018destroyer\u2019 <i>Blood of Majesties</i> chewed his lip thoughtfully as he sat in his command chair, watching the oncoming tide of metal. Like anyone else, the Askanj-<i>teseht</i> would prefer not to die, but there were over four dozen transports and civilian craft berthed at this palisade station. Tens of thousands of lives hung in the balance. He couldn\u2019t \u2013 wouldn\u2019t \u2013 abandon them. The Enemy was without concept of mercy, their divine right to rule granting them absolution from any sin committed in the name of peace. <i>Their</i> peace.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cDo we have shooting solutions?\u201d he asked in calmly, as he had every other time. Gleaming Eyes at Dusk, the ship\u2019s second mistress, bobbed her head in the negative, an annoyed hiss slithering through her teeth. Her irritation was not directed at him, but towards the Compact who had learned a few new tricks in how to shroud their vessels.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNot yet,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re still too far out.\u201d The end of her tail twitched. Save for Kesesh himself and the communications officer, the destroyer\u2019s command deck was populated entirely by Askanj-<i>illith</i>. On his first day in command, Kesesh had trod on no fewer than four of his subordinates\u2019 tails and the rest of the week hadn\u2019t gone much better. They\u2019d called him Squadron Master Lead-Foot, the title now used more in affection than pained irritation. In fairness, the serpentine Askanj-<i>illith</i> were over half tail... and it was a very small bridge.<br>", " <br>", "A sad little smile touched his lips as he looked around his command, at the cramped confines of duty stations pressed up against each other, sinuous bodies hunched over consoles, the gleam of holograms and display screens shining against iridescent scales.<br>", " <br>", "<i>I\u2019m going to miss this ship,</i> Kesesh thought. He remained in silence until Gleaming Eyes at Dusk raised her head, her crest flaring as she bared her teeth. She didn\u2019t even need to say it; data from the fleet\u2019s predictive engines was populating the master holo tank, firing patterns coming up as the Tactical officers in the squadron streamlined the data coming to them. Ready icons pulsed a deep orange. \u201cAll ships linked in,\u201d the Askanj-<i>illith</i> reported. \u201cWe are ready for salvo fire at your command.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The squadron master nodded. \u201cRapid launch mode.\u201d Kesesh reached out, his fingers drifting through the mirage of hostile ship icons and his squadron\u2019s readiness indicators. He was looking for something... there. \u201cThis one,\u201d he ordered, wrapping his fingers around one hull in particular. The logic engine pulsed a dull blue halo around the vessel, confirming his guess. \u201cThis one dies first.\u201d Gleaming Eyes nodded, gesturing to Communications, who updated the squadron\u2019s firing orders.<br>", " <br>", "The squadron master let his eyes drift further into the plot, towards the massive, brooding threat icon of the enemy Chariot. <i>May all the gods damn you to hell.</i><br>", " <br>", "\u201cLoose,\u201d he ordered.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>Blood of Majesties</i>, like the other ten members of its squadron, was the Principality\u2019s primary response to the Compact\u2019s superiority in heavy capital ships. Early on in their history, the Askanj had built vessels that could be considered dreadnaughts as a counter to the Compact\u2019s own Chariots. Unfortunately, the construction and operation of such massive vessels represented a technological barrier that at the time the Principality had yet to cross. Consequently, their initial run of titan-grade warships fared very poorly against Chariots. Aside from a handful of anomalous encounters, this was a pattern that never reversed itself throughout the two nations\u2019 long and bloody history.<br>", " <br>", "The Principality largely abandoned development into dreadnaughts. In the centuries to follow, the project would be occasionally be restarted. Lack of political will often killed these enterprises swiftly, but they would sometimes be seen to completion. The inevitable humiliating defeat would then serve to bury dreadnaught research for many more generations. The fact of the matter was, that despite their advantages in other areas, the many races of the Principality were at a consistent disadvantage in the production, operation and utilization of dreadnaught-scale vessels. Nor were they alone; smaller star nations had economically destroyed themselves merely in the <i>attempt</i> to build vessels that could successfully engage a god-ship of the Compact.<br>", " <br>", "Humanity\u2019s success against <i>Bringer of Light</i> had, at one point, stoked interest among the Great Houses of the Principality \u2013 enough to consider supporting the Confederacy, although the fall of Earth came before any decision could be reached. This fascination had only been renewed in the centuries since, when the tale of a most unusual reaver reached their ears. They had never been able to match the Compact on an equal footing and the chance to acquire <i>Nemesis</i> for themselves was too good to pass up. Their industrial might was only overshadowed by their enemy\u2019s and whereas the Compact only produced dreadnaughts in a slow but steady trickle, the Principality would gleefully throw every scrap of manufacturing power they had into mass-producing such titans.<br>", " <br>", "Until that day came, they would simply have to make do with ships like <i>Blood of Majesties</i>.<br>", " <br>", "It was a second-generation <i> Impaler</i> class \u2018destroyer\u2019, sacrificing virtually all other armament for the powerful rail cannon that it had been built around, a gun eight hundred meters long. Even larger than those found upon battleships and Chariots, it was a siege weapon. Powerful analytical systems watched the Compact fleet, a shell of drones and recon platforms licking at and prying through the enemy\u2019s jamming to observe fleet disposition, course and acceleration. That information was sent back to <i>Blood of Majesties</i> and its data-linked cousins, their battle analysis programs developing fire patterns, the squadron tightly bound as single entity.<br>", " <br>", "Upon Kesesh\u2019s order, his squadron went to rapid-fire. Eleven railguns fired as one, each of them hurling a shell towards the Compact fleet at eighty-four percent of light speed. Seven seconds later, they did it again. And again.<br>", " <br>", "And again.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The leading elements of Execution Force Renan writhed in a hellstorm as they waded through blast after blast, screens shunting aside the worst of the radiation. The range was long; it would take several minutes for any railfire to reach them and even the most simple of maneuvers could cause a kinetic impactor to miss by hundreds, if not thousands of kilometers. This problem was one that the Principality had long since solved: fire, and keep firing. Drown your opponent in so much ordnance that you couldn\u2019t fail to hit them, sooner or later.<br>", " <br>", "As for the misses, that was, of course, what the warheads were for.<br>", " <br>", "As soon as each projectile\u2019s onboard tracking systems estimated that it would not hit its target, it carried out its only other function. Matter and antimatter merged in a terrible embrace and vast, terrible flares burst across the starscape. Even if those were too far away to damage their targets, the blasts would burn out any sensors looking their way, the thermal scars and swathes of radiation left in the aftermath confusing Compact sensors and eroding their EW systems.<br>", " <br>", "The destroyer <i>Tigurin Nzeth</i> shouldered its way through one such detonation, the explosion far too close for comfort. Radiation hazard warnings flashed brightly across the main display. The ship\u2019s commander bared her teeth, her fist hammering the arm of her chair as <i>Nzeth</i> ploughed towards the enemy counterparts, still outside the armada\u2019s missile range. The execution force\u2019s own railguns were silent; Compact computers were not as adept as the Jackals\u2019. The Askanj were cowards who shunned combat, relying on their damned railfire to whittle Compact fleets down to odds that they found favourable.<br>", " <br>", "An alarm thrummed and the group leader lifted her head, grimacing. The enemy\u2019s targeting was narrowing; they\u2019d identified <i>Nzeth</i>\u2019s brother, <i>Tigurin Naketh</i> as the squadron\u2019s leader. The destroyer thrashed and rolled through the cone of fire, its every maneuver planned for, vast explosions ripping all around it. Already, <i>Naketh</i> was taking damage from so many near misses. A single direct hit and the squadron would lose its datalinks, a small but noticeable chink opening in the fleet\u2019s defence envelope. <i>Tigurin Naketh</i> needed time to withdraw, to rebuild their ECM shrouds and hide once more. Time that they just didn\u2019t have. Not unless...<br>", " <br>", "\u201cTake us in!\u201d the group leader snapped without a moment\u2019s hesitation. <i>Tigurin Nzeth</i> heeled into the path of the weapons firing on her command ship, buying them the time they needed. The group leader\u2019s last sight was of <i>Naketh</i> disappearing into the squadron\u2019s ranks before <i>Tigurin Nzeth</i> took a round intended to cripple a battleship directly amidships.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Renan closed his eyes briefly as <i>Tigurin Nzeth</i>\u2019s icon faded from the display. They were today\u2019s first casualty, but they would not be the last. As he\u2019d suspected, there was a squadron of titan-killers amongst the destroyers. Indeed, he\u2019d specifically chosen this emergence point in the hopes of confronting them. Against the massed screens of his fleet, their backs to the citadel \u2013 they would die. If he had ignored or avoided them, they would harry his flanks and rear, picking away at his strength and running from retribution... until the range opened and they could fire again.<br>", " <br>", "It was the cold equations of void war. This many lives now, for that many later. It was necessary and right... but that meant little to the dead.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Tigurin Jeskal</i> burned, broadcasting its distress as the lamed ship struggled to disengage. Thirty seconds later, three rounds burst in shockingly close proximity and the day\u2019s losses went to two.<br>", " <br>", "And then, three. <i>Tigurin Forar</i>\u2019s forward half vanished as a rail round smashed straight through the destroyer, the remaining piece of its hull spinning insanely on its axis, the fractured hull ripping itself to pieces.<br>", " <br>", "The Jackals were still looking to reacquire <i>Tigurin Naketh</i>, trying to destroy his squadron commanders and their deputies, to rob his fleet of cohesion.<br>", " <br>", "An alert flashed on the master plot and Renan nodded to himself. There; they\u2019d entered missile range.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The fortress fired first, launching nearly one hundred missiles at the Compact fleet. It was the only defensive unit that could hold missiles with enough range to reach them; the warheads the escorts and light cruisers had simply didn\u2019t have the range to cross the distance between the approaching fleets. Their drives would burn out long before reaching effective attack range. The distance to the Compact fleet was dropping steadily; they were, in fact still outside the outer limits of the Principality attack envelope, but the armada was closing so quickly that by the time the missiles reached them, they would be in range.<br>", " <br>", "Askanj weapons masters didn\u2019t bother to try to penetrate the thick ECM shell that surrounded the hostile dreadnaught; they had no chance of doing so, or even getting their missiles through the Compact\u2019s fleet. Their missile was to strip that fleet from the dreadnaught, to pull away its support and leave it unprotected.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cPoint defences to supporting fire. Open the fleet,\u201d Renan ordered. \u201cGive us a clear firing line.\u201d Pulling his ships further out of each others\u2019 support range would increase the damage caused by the citadel\u2019s opening salvos, but it was the cold equations. This many now or that many later. \u201cOnce you are satisfied with the solution, Flush all external racks. Leave nothing.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Renan allowed himself a single, small tight smile as he imagined the enemy officer\u2019s reaction. <i>You are not the sole voice of innovation in this galaxy.</i> A <i>Manifest Beacon of Enlightenment</i> Chariot carried an external payload of over eight hundred heavy capital missiles, the largest shipborne warheads in existence. Only cairn-type citadels and the Wound carried heavier weapons. Normal engagement range was twenty-four million kilometers. The Principality\u2019s drives gave their weapons slightly longer bite; close to twenty-eight million for their own heavy shipkillers. <i>Redemption of Sol</i> had just launched from over thirty million kilometers. The Principality had thought they were safe from retaliation, that they could choose the pace of their assault. Now, they were struggling to override pre-set firing plans, to set up new firing plans \u2013 to take into account the fact that they would be dead much sooner than they had anticipated.<br>", " <br>", "They did their best. The would-be godkillers fired until the heat from their railcannons damaged their own ships and eroded their own ECM, angling proximity-fused shells into the midst of that swarm. The point defences from their more conventionally armed compatriots swept through the swarm, counter-missiles preceding a desperate fusillade of lasers. Updated orders from <i>Redemption of Sol</i> changed targeting priorities and several dozen missiles heeled away, driving down the throat of the destroyers firing upon them, forcing them to choose between protecting themselves or defending the fortress.<br>", " <br>", "Distant flashes of light, temporary stars gleaming with painful brilliance before fading, marked each lost vessel. <i>Blood of Majesties</i> was targeted by no less than three shipkillers, and it vanished in a searing conflagration that left nothing behind but an expanding cloud of molecular gas. The remains of its squadron, their command links severed, fought and died alone, burning as brightly as their lost command ship. The station they had hoped to protect followed them into death, its hull gouged and scored, secondary explosions chewing its ravaged husk to pieces, hurling asteroid-sized fragments of the outpost and the freighters still docked to it in all directions.<br>", " <br>", "Renan\u2019s losses were lower than he\u2019d expected \u2013 the citadel had managed to get several follow-on salvos off before it had been destroyed, but they had been rushed and ill-targeted. The station\u2019s destruction had severed what command links the warheads had and they had stupidly rushed into his massed fire, lost their locks or chased scope-ghosts into the ether. Still, the tally was now at 8. Eight dead ships; six escorts, two capitals. It could have been worse, but so could it have been better. If he hadn\u2019t let his formation open so much...<br>", " <br>", "...but then it <i>would</i> be much, much worse.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cFirst deadline destroyed,\u201d Aul\u2019ia reported. \u201cScope drones are confirming additional light units are falling back.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNot for long,\u201d Renan mused. \u201cWe surprised them. They will rally and mass against our support ships.\u201d He tapped his fingers against the arm of his command throne. \u201cOpen the fleet further,\u201d he ordered. \u201cWe are smitten with the success of our new weapon, are we not? We don\u2019t wish to hold back, to have our targeting obscured by our own ships. We want to flaunt our power to them. Yes, we do,\u201d he nodded and his eyes were cold. \u201cLet them see us.\u201d <i>Come to me,</i> he called to the Jackal forces. <i>Come and kill me if you dare.</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>I watch each of these infinitesimal specks of metal, a pale shadow of what I could be.

She had been an avowed atheist until this moment. Perhaps she still was; there were no gods. No god could have allowed this to happen.<br>", " <br>", "No, there were no gods... but there was a Hell. She knew this because she\u2019d seen one of its demons. She\u2019d heard it speak.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBurn with me,\u201d the Thoughtful mouthed the words as she looked over the oil-soaked ocean, at the fires and thick, choking smoke that rose into the atmosphere. \u201cBurn with me.\u201d She forced herself to turn her head, to look at the beach. There was no sand, not any more: only glass and molten pools of metal. There was nothing organic; it had all been vapourized. Ashes were falling from the sky, settling on her and making her pale skin even paler. She was being coated in the dead.<br>", " <br>", "A sick orange glow suffused the seaward horizon; half a dozen mining rigs burned like funeral pyres, their burning fuel covering the Numish Sea in a slick coat of liquid fire, thick choking fumes completely blotting out the setting sun.<br>", " <br>", "It had started this morning.<br>", " <br>", "Delacore was a service world, rich in the heavy metals that were hard to find amongst asteroids. With only the smallest smattering of life barely worthy of the name, it was perfect for resource extraction, mining and eventual planetcracking. The Justamian Ore and Energy Concern had bid for and been granted an exclusive Right of Exploitation to Delacore. Mining stations and foundries were established, with nearly four-point-seven million workers shipped in from offworld, just for the first phase of operations.<br>", " <br>", "The planet itself was not the only prize; the entire system had been blessed with an abundance of mineral wealth and resources, enough to build, fuel and supply thousands of ships. Full resource extraction could take centuries and the company would reap the benefits of wringing every last drop of profit from the system. That was where Ashl\u2019eua came in; she was an expert at undersea mining and Delacore had rich mineral deposits beneath its seabed, just waiting to be snapped up.<br>", " <br>", "They\u2019d brought her in specially to get that phase of their operations back on track; the ocean mining had run into delay after delay. Administrative, technological \u2013 even worker unrest amidst the formation of an illegal union. She could little about that, but she had been able to assist with other problems. Whoever had been in charge before she arrived had been an idiot \u2013 the topographic surveys she\u2019d found were incomplete, corrupt or simply outright inaccurate. Misfiled documents, a database in shambles. Duplication of work here, ignoring untapped veins there. Unacceptable. Like many of her people, Ashl\u2019eua had a predilection for detail work and this... this was... unacceptable! It took most of her first month just to get everything in order.<br>", " <br>", "Oh, the department heads swore that they didn\u2019t know anything about that, that they were positive every possible precaution and procedure had been followed, but their computers told a different story. Wasteful deployment of mining rigs to areas with little or no value. Consistent network and system errors that had not yet been scrubbed from their system. Conflicting orders to work crews. It was as if these people either had no clue what they were doing, or were determined to sabotage each others\u2019 work \u2013 and oh, wasn\u2019t <i>that</i> was a common excuse: \u2018I took those readings myself \u2013 it must have been (and here the scapegoat was named) who misfiled/altered/destroyed them! He/she has always been jealous/feuding with/unreasonable towards me, the innocent victim!\u2019<br>", " <br>", "It wouldn\u2019t have been the first time that such a thing occurred \u2013 a vital project brought down because of the infighting amongst its own oversees, but Ashl\u2019eua had been determined not to let it happen on her watch. She was not a manager, not someone who particularly wanted to be or enjoyed working with people \u2013 the Thoughtful felt that they tended to get underfoot more than not \u2013 but the extreme incompetence of the operation had forced her to take an active hand. If they were going to behave like children, then that\u2019s how she would treat them. Computer access had been restricted, vital files had been completely removed from the network and required her permission to access. All orders required a confirmation code. All data must be manually backed-up in offline servers.<br>", " <br>", "The complaints had been strenuous, but Ashl\u2019eua had been relentless in pushing her changes down the company\u2019s throat. She didn\u2019t care that she was \u2018strangling productivity\u2019 \u2013 at least with her reforms, there was <i>some</i> productivity instead of the breeding ground of internecine bickering, recriminations and self-defeating sabotage. Things had been looking up for the first time in months.<br>", " <br>", "Then, they had found the ship.<br>", " <br>", "Submerged beneath Hypirodon Bay, it had been resting on the seabed. There had been no violence to its arrival here, so it was not a crash. Its landing had been controlled and measured; the sediment deposition and local geography clearly indicated that it had arrived there and landed with all the grace something of its mass was capable of. There were a few hydrothermal vents in Hypirodon; perhaps it had intended to tap them for geothermal power? Whatever the reason was, it was not blocking access to any valuable metal deposits, so it was none of her concern. The Thoughtful was content to leave it at that. Her specialities were in geology, resource extraction, paleontology \u2013 not exobiology, engineering or anthropology.<br>", " <br>", "She did note its presence in her reports to company headquarters, but had not concerned herself with it further \u2013 her job was to get operations back on track, not waste time and man-hours on playing with some salt-rusted relic. However, events had conspired to change that. In the fastest response from headquarters ever, she had been ordered to secure the wreck and to draw up plans for salvage and/or recovery.<br>", " <br>", "A needless waste of time and resources that Ashl\u2019eua had stewed over each and every day. It had been a relief when the military had moved in to \u2018oversee\u2019 the project. Little more than an observer to the goings-on, the Thoughtful had been able to devote some time back to the mining operations, although it hadn\u2019t lasted. It wasn\u2019t long before she\u2019d been effectively conscripted to work on data analysis. Unacceptable. Unfortunately, the company had been very vocal in its agreement with, and subordination to, the military for this project. Most unusual, given the extrasolars\u2019 usual resistance to governmental intrusion in their affairs. Something <i>else</i> she didn\u2019t want to be interested in, but which nonetheless niggled its way through the back of her brain.<br>", " <br>", "Annoying as it was, the Thoughtful had been proud of herself for developing a means of extracting the hulk. It would take half a dozen mining rigs working in concert and the assistance of several of Delacore\u2019s orbital works, but it would safely and quickly remove the unclassified vessel from the seabed. What it was doing there \u2013 that was another irritating, itching little fact. Still, her superiors had seemed impressed by her work \u2013 which they\u2019d then showed by exiling her from her own offices on board the command rig, banishing her to a small coastal office building.<br>", " <br>", "Well, at least it gave her a view of Hypirodon Bay, so she could view her work come to fruition. The rigs were in position, the recovery ships and orbital works all in place. Hypirodon beach was filled, almost to the horizon with watchful military forces \u2013 armoured divisions, artillery, fixed emplacements. The sky buzzed with pinnaces, shuttles and gunships. Everything appeared to be ready.<br>", " <br>", "Finally, the first contact team descended to the vessel, bleating a transmission in all known languages. They had announced themselves as agents of the Compact of Species and were eager to open a dialogue with whomever was aboard.<br>", " <br>", "The answer had been as shocking as it had been unexpected, a golden beam of light ripping up from the depths, annihilating the contact team and spearing the command rig straight through the heart. In an instant, the platform was transformed into a cloud of vapour, ignited fuel stores splashing throughout the cove.<br>", " <br>", "There\u2019d been a single text transmission from the unknown. It had ripped its way into the wireless networks, taking control of every computer it could reach. Despite the situation, Ashl\u2019eua had felt a little flicker of pride that her security measures kept it from taking absolute control of her rigs\u2019 networks. That self-assurance had died in the next instant as a message appeared on every subverted screen:<br>", " <br>", "BURN WITH ME<br>", " <br>", "Against the voice in her head that told her to run from the building, jump in her aircar and keep driving until it ran out of fuel, Ashl\u2019eua had stepped outside into the once-chilly Delacore morning, the orange glow of burning fuel filling the bay. Ignoring all sense of reason, she had walked up to a small cliff overlooking the bay, stood on the edge and watched a demon\u2019s birth. Her staff had done the more reasonable thing and fled. Some had even tried to get her to come with them, but she had ignored them all.<br>", " <br>", "It had risen from the inferno, sheets of blazing water spilling from its hull, patches of burning oil and fuel clinging to its baroque armour, flickering like the torches lining the walls of some ancient fortress. Thin, blazing lances had licked from its flanks, each barely kissing the remaining mining rigs surrounding the titan. Fresh flames had risen into the night sky, the shudder of the platforms\u2019 deaths rolling across the bay like thunder.<br>", " <br>", "The army had reacted, opening up with everything they had, sheets of fire lancing from the beach at the hostile. For all their fury, their fusillade barely scratched its armour.<br>", " <br>", "It fired again, its beams ripping up into the morning sky. Dull flashes of light had followed them as the stations and satellites hanging overhead died. Almost negligently, it had swatted the fighters and gunships strafing it, sending more wreckage to burn in the water. It had hung in mid-air, glistening and aflame as the burning water still fell from it, rotating to face the army arrayed against it. There had been something in that moment; Ashl\u2019eua couldn\u2019t have said what... but it could have killed them at any time. It didn\u2019t need to face them. Was it enjoying their helplessness? Was it considering them, some alien mind churning slowly before reaching the inevitable conclusion? Was it hate that made it want to look upon them? She didn\u2019t know \u2013 she\u2019d <i>never</i> know \u2013 and she\u2019d be happier for it.<br>", " <br>", "What had seemed an eternity was only a handful of seconds. A single sweep of a beam and the army vanished. The beach upon which they\u2019d stood melted to liquid glass. Tanks boiled away to nothing. Power-armoured troopers evaporated. Soldiers \u2013 thousands of men and women \u2013 reduced to ash and dust in a single moment, slaughtered as easily as the mining platforms.<br>", " <br>", "It hadn\u2019t even hesitated, rising up into the sky, the power of its thrusters boiling and lashing the ocean beneath. In seconds it was nothing but an indistinct shape in the closing clouds and soon, not even that. With the muted crash of distant thunder, Ashl\u2019eua heard it fire again. She didn\u2019t know at what; she didn\u2019t want to know.<br>", " <br>", "She stood there for a very long time, unable to move. Not until a coast guard vessel saw her on the edge of the cliff, staring out at the broken sea.<br>", " <br>", "There were no gods, but there were demons. She\u2019d seen one rise from Hell.<br>", " <br>", "To this day, the reason for the Wound\u2019s presence on Delacore has never been discovered, nor its esoteric method of concealment. It is believed that its presence was in some way related to the Delacore System Kill which occurred seventeen months later.</div>"]}

Turned away for one... a pressure door... in half...\u201d Faithful Burz\u2019s voice rumbled in Grace\u2019s ears, as the young women climbed a ladder, still listening to the Tribune\u2019s logs. \u201cThat\u2019s... so far. This ship... toll. The workers are... rumours... about how...\u201d A burst of static obliterated the rest of the dead engineer\u2019s words. That was all she\u2019d get out of this entry.<br>", " <br>", "Grace frowned. The story, what she could make out from the decayed data tracks, was depressingly similar to the current situation, but there was nothing there that could shed any more light on the specifics. Without more than his familiar name, even Burz himself was impossible to identify. Grace almost growled in frustration, surprising herself. It was getting harder to act as she knew she should.<br>", " <br>", "She wasn\u2019t certain that she even wanted to. The thought was frightening - she should report herself to confessor Yurim, but she couldn\u2019t. Not until she was done here. She hadn\u2019t even told Nasham she was returning to this part of the ship.<br>", " <br>", "Her heart was pounding in her chest as she approached a familiar doorway and the young woman\u2019s hand shook as she reached for the control panel. She hesitated a moment before hitting it and stepping through into a room filled with bodies. They were in the exact same positions that she\u2019d left them, most of them with a hole in the back of their heads with the only exception slumped next to the weapon that had killed his fellows. There was something here, something that had caught her attention before, but she hadn\u2019t acted on her intuition. What she was doing could be considered desecration of a Tribune\u2019s body, to say nothing of the many other regulations that said the best thing she could do was leave this to others.<br>", " <br>", "Allyria wouldn\u2019t have. At least, not without an argument. Somehow, that thought gave her the courage to continue.<br>", " <br>", " <br>", "The young woman knelt beside the executioner\u2019s corpse, trembling fingers reaching out to the soldier\u2019s chestplate. This Tribune had been an officer, an ideologue. The first time she\u2019d come here, she\u2019d swiped away the decades\u2019 worth of dust over his curiously blank nameplate. One of the service markers there had seemed familiar; jaws enclosing a world of blue and green. The pattern of the landmasses was generic; convention dictated that there be nothing singling a particular location out on any decoration. It wasn\u2019t until Grace had been back at base camp that she\u2019d remembered where she\u2019d seen another sigil like this one.<br>", " <br>", "Grace\u2019s hand shook and she willed herself to be steady as she swept more of the dust from the ideologue\u2019s cuirass, uncovering the entire row of campaign marks. She touched two fingers to the one she\u2019d recognized \u2013 she\u2019d seen it somewhere else. Not as a simple decal, but on a medallion. She\u2019d had occasion to wear her dress uniform only once, when her class had met the commanders and staff of <i>Bequeathed</i>. Kilgrave had been wearing the medal. She\u2019d thought he looked like a hero, his breast decorated with service medals from his service in the Janissary Corps. One of Rally\u2019s successes, trained as a soldier yet he\u2019d impressed his superiors with his dedication and bravery and been elevated to the officer corps. A symbol of the dedication and capability of humans and the beneficence and gratitude of the Compact \u2013 everything Grace had wanted to be.<br>", " <br>", "Allyria had hated him the instant she\u2019d laid eyes on him. The Verrish had hid it as well as she could, but she\u2019d been glaring daggers at Kilgrave the entire ceremony. She\u2019d hated him ever since that day, but Grace hadn\u2019t understood why. She\u2019d come to have her own opinion of Kilgrave, but she\u2019d never known why the Verrish had despised the man to such a degree.<br>", " <br>", "<i>I guess she was just a better judge of character than I was,</i> she thought sadly. With deft fingers, she found the dead officer\u2019s ID tags and unhooked them. She lifted the tags, frowning. Where the man\u2019s name and serial number should be had been had been removed \u2013 erased completely. Age hadn\u2019t done this, nor had any battle damage. This had been deliberate, an act to erase the soldier\u2019s identity. Grace investigated the other corpses \u2013 like the ideologue, there was no indication of their identities. None of them even carried any personal effects. No trinkets, keepsakes, ornaments or fetishes. This couldn\u2019t have been done post-mortem. There\u2019d be no point \u2013 just flush the bodies out into space. This had been carried out before they\u2019d ever set foot on the ship.<br>", " <br>", "What was going on?<br>", " <br>", "Grace\u2019s palms tingled uncomfortably as she looked back over the bodies. What she\u2019d already done, she could say she was simply attempting to identify the fallen. It wouldn\u2019t win her any points with staff concerned about medical or forensic issues, but it would be hard to call it desecration. If she truly wanted to try and learn who these people were, she\u2019d have to go further. She wasn\u2019t sure she could do that.<br>", " <br>", "Fortunately, fate intervened. An icon flashed on her HUD and Grace blink-clicked it up. Her suit wasn\u2019t a particularly complex piece of engineering \u2013 it was an all-purpose EVA suit, capable of doing a little of everything and excelling at nothing. She was, however, picking up a power source. It hadn\u2019t been there before. That wasn\u2019t in and of itself unusual; as the repair crews patched the hulk, more of its systems came back, often in sections that had seemed utterly dead. There was still no primary function access, but faithful Trenis believed restoring the core would give him and his teams full control of the vessel.<br>", " <br>", "Grace wasn\u2019t so sure.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI\u2019m registering a new signal,\u201d Grace reported, sending her coordinates to Nasham. \u201cMoving to investigate.\u201d She half-expected a query about her present location, but all she received was the pack leader\u2019s single blip of acknowledgement.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThis is where it happened, huh?\u201d Sang looked over the cul-de-sac. The shorter girl ran her tongue over her teeth as she squatted, ogre-like, in her armour. Telden Squad\u2019s scope specialist held out her palm, the enhanced scanners built into the palm coming to life. \u201cDust,\u201d the young woman reported. \u201cMore dust. Nothing organic.\u201d She stood with a soft growl of servos, her helmet canted towards Lydia. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here, Two.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cRight,\u201d Jameson nodded curtly. \u201cThanks anyways, Five.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Sang turned fully towards the other girl, the headlights on her suit bathing Jameson\u2019s own armour in white light, Lydia\u2019s HUD automatically compensating for the brightness. \u201cWhat\u2019d you see here, Lyds? What\u2019d it show you?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNothing. Just... just one of those ghosts in the machine the techs keep blathering about.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Jessica didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cIf it was nothing, you would\u2019ve logged it. You wouldn\u2019t have pulled me out here instead of leaving it for the one of the twerps.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Jameson narrowed her eyes, \u201cAnd I suppose you twitching whenever the comm acts up \u2013 that\u2019s nothing too?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Sang\u2019s head came up. Lydia couldn\u2019t see the other girl\u2019s face, but she could guess at her expression. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Jessica snapped defensively.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d Lydia said, facing her squadmate. Instead of the blank visor of her own helm, Sang\u2019s armour had an older helmet with red-tinted lenses. It gave her a sinister, almost demonic look. Humans were not imposing on their own and this had been one of many attempts to give human Janissaries a psychological advantage in combat. Tribunes, well over eight feet tall in full armour, didn\u2019t need those kinds of handicaps. The soldier-cadet lifted her head. \u201cI can hear it too.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Jessica went very still. \u201cYou can?\u201d she asked softly.<br>", " <br>", "Jameson slouched down against the bulkhead, looking up at the ceiling. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t speak in Compact Standard,\u201d she said at last. \u201cAnd all I hear are bits and pieces. Like half a conversation through a wall. A syllable here. Maybe a word or two. You listen, because you\u2019re not sure that you heard what you heard. You strain and you listen and all you hear is static and you start thinking you\u2019re crazy, like someone who says they hear voices in the rushing of water. You tell yourself that that\u2019s all it was, you start to relax... and then you hear it again.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNever when there\u2019s someone else around,\u201d Jessica continued. \u201cOnly when it\u2019s just you. You hear the words... the awful words and you start wondering.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Lydia raised her head. \u201cWondering what?\u201d There was no immediate answer and she pressed. \u201cWondering, <i>what</i>?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Jessica didn\u2019t answer for a long time. \u201cIf what it says is true,\u201d she whispered.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Gren Vol\u2019s skin itched and he struggled to keep himself from scratching. It was a nervous habit, one common to his species, just as Thinkers might blink excessively or Broken sweated. Every minute he spent on this ship gnawed at him. He didn\u2019t want to be here. The angles of the walls were all wrong, the darkness was too absolute, lit only by unpredictable, painful bursts of illumination.<br>", " <br>", "The helmet lights of his team played over the walls as they crept through the airless corridor, one of many that had lost atmosphere. There was no pattern to the damage, unless one considered having it in the most annoying, inconvenient places to be some kind of pattern and not merely fortune\u2019s whimsy.<br>", " <br>", "Preparations for the core tap were nearing completion. It was odd \u2013 though he was only a lowly sectator, Gren would have expected preparing to connect an umbilical from the derelict to <i>Bequeathed</i> would be far more difficult than seemed to be \u2013 and that was working with known technology. On this hulk, it should have been taken far, far longer. Instead... issues arose and were solved in record time Gren heard the comments about \u2018amazingly intuitive\u2019 systems and \u2018good fortune\u2019, but he didn\u2019t believe it. He had spent years working with machines, studying them, taking them apart and putting them back together. Nothing \u2013 <i>nothing</i> \u2013 this badly damaged could be working so well.<br>", " <br>", "Which meant...<br>", " <br>", "...<i>she\u2019s not as damaged as we think.</i><br>", " <br>", "He didn\u2019t know when he\u2019d started thinking of this wreck as feminine. He\u2019d heard some others doing the same \u2013 mostly humans, but humans tended to think in more primitive terms and anthropomorphize their surroundings. It was irritating that he\u2019d picked up one of their bad habits. And yet...<br>", " <br>", "...the wreck wasn\u2019t an <i>it</i>. It just wasn\u2019t.<br>", " <br>", "He had tried to impress his concerns on his superiors, but without any real commitment. He knew the rumours surrounding Pack Leader Nasham and had no wish to be seen as damaged. Unrest was already running through the Broken ranks. Even the officers must have heard the tales being told but they did nothing. Faithful Trenis barely left the hulk\u2019s central core, obsessing over every possible facet of technology, running his teams to the point of exhaustion as they fought, cursed and sweated against the mercurial systems. The expedition\u2019s officers stayed in the secure parts of the ship, unwilling to risk the beast\u2019s spasms. None of them had seen what others claimed to. None of them had heard the music that he had.<br>", " <br>", "Gren\u2019s head pounded as he remembered that damned litany. It still infested his head, an insensate melody that poisoned his thoughts. Sometimes he thought that he actually was diseased, that he had cracked from the strain. More often, he was wondering if it were not him... if it was everyone else. The ones who hadn\u2019t been into the darkened bowels of <i>her</i>. There was nothing wrong with him.<br>", " <br>", "There couldn\u2019t be. No, it couldn\u2019t be just him.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWith all commensurate respect, patron,\u201d Ashtun said, struggling to hold onto his temper. \u201cWe need to draw down our workforce. There is nothing here that will not keep until we have further support.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Usul\u2019s epression didn\u2019t change. \u201cHave there been any incidents due to worker fatigue?\u201d He dabbed at the corners of his mouth with a handkerchief before dropping it back to the table. The kerchief caught a gust from the air circulation system and billowed to the floor. The group leader did not move to reclaim it. His steward scurried forward to pick it up, the young woman bowing respectfully as she retreated to fetch a clean cloth.<br>", " <br>", "Ashtun watched her for a moment. Her pelt \u2013 hair, he reminded himself \u2013 was close-cropped, almost to her skull and she smelled of soap. Human odour was... perhaps not as offensive as some claimed, but it was noticeable to the Tribunes. MacFadden, like many Broken in her position, had to adhere to strict hygienic guidelines. \u201cNo,\u201d he admitted finally. \u201cBut it\u2019s only a matter of time. The shifts aren\u2019t doing morale any favours either.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Usul snorted loudly. \u201cThe confessors and my security teams should suffice to keep order amongst the ranks.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The submissive shook his head. \u201cRegulations dictate that we should be drawing down our teams, especially since we don\u2019t have a large pool of experienced technicians or officers.\u201d He leaned forward, his posture assertive but not yet challenging. \u201cThese are cadets, patron. This was supposed to be a simple cold-space exercise for the officers and noncoms to give them a taste of the void before we pat them on the head and send them off to some gods-forsaken corner of the realm. Instead, we\u2019ve put them into a situation they\u2019re not prepared or trained for.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou have been speaking to pack leader Nasham,\u201d Usul noted, taking a sip from a glass of spiced wine. He sighed. \u201cUnexpected situations are to be expected, submissive. This is greater preparation for their careers than anything their little deep-desert Academy could possibly teach them.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Ashtun bit back his response. Usul was correct, but it was not what protocol called for. He tapped his fingers against the tabletop, thinking. \u201cThere has still been no response from local command?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d growled Usul, cutting into his steak viciously. \u201cColumn Leader Prime Seyr has not deigned to reply to my missives yet.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The younger Tribune kept his expression carefully neutral as he responded. He wasn\u2019t sure what the source of the bad blood behind his leader and the prime was, but he had no desire to get in the middle of it. \u201cIt may take some time to gather assets. <i>Remoulder</i> was, I believe, set to begin laying down the foundations of the Juultan docks. If the prime chooses to send <i>Mortician\u2019s Dismay</i>, that could explain the delay. I understand preparing such a... venerable ship for shocking requires no small effort.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHrrrn,\u201d Usul grunted. \u201cAt the very least, you would think that our superiors would deign to inform us as to their intent.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThey may have,\u201d Ashtun said, sipping at his own wine. Delicious, with a smoky, fruity taste that danced along one\u2019s tongue. The group leader had an excellent sense for vintages and the humans did grow some impressive wines. Exports of Rally\u2019s spirits were a growing concern. \u201cWe were supposed be returning to port by now. Column Leader prime Seyr may have assumed that we had done so and directed any couriers to Rally directly.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Usul growled. \u201cI informed him as to our intent.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "<i>\u2018Our\u2019? An interesting choice of words.</i> \u201cThen I expect we\u2019ll hear from local command shortly,\u201d Ashtun said. He paused. \u201cAlthough it is possible than any courier was lost in transit. Even today, such things do occur.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The group leader mused on that thoughtfully. \u201cPerhaps, perhaps. Unlikely, but possible.\u201d He held out his goblet and MacFadden scurried into the room to refill it. Even if the steward had lifted her gaze enough to meet her superior\u2019s eyes, Usul wasn\u2019t looking at her. He sighed again. \u201cThis situation is not what I expected,\u201d he admitted at last. \u201cBut it is the situation we have and we will carry out the mission to secure this wreck and its technology for the glory of the Compact.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOf course, patron,\u201d Ashtun said smoothly, hiding his disquiet. \u201cFor the glory of the Compact.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Lydia demanded.<br>", " <br>", "Jessica\u2019s head tilted, the red lenses of her eyes meeting Jameson\u2019s blank faceplate. \u201cNothing,\u201d she mumbled, turning to go. \u201cNothing.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "With a growl of synthetic muscles, Lydia rose to her feet, putting one hand on Sang\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s not good enough, Five.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Sang shook off her comrade\u2019s touch. \u201cToo fucking bad. That\u2019s all you get.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI showed you this.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou got a broke-ass holographic recording. Whoop-dee-fucking-do. I\u2019m not getting sectioned out,\u201d the other girl snapped. \u201cYou know how close my social worker was to signing me up for a chem implant? I need to be here.\u201d Jessica stalked away. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything to you and I sure as shit didn\u2019t hear anything.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Lydia followed her. \u201cGet back here.

The blow would have crushed every bone in Jesscia\u2019s skull to paste if she hadn\u2019t been armoured. As it was, it merely staggered her back a pace. \u201cWe\u2019re. Not. Done,\u201d Jameson snarled, feeling her cheeks flush with equal parts shame and anger.<br>", " <br>", "Jessica stared at her as if shocked, though her demon-faced helm was expressionless. Then with an inarticulate cry, the cadet threw herself at her fellow Janissary. Both young women slammed together like bull elephants, grappling, swearing and raining blows on each other. It was stupid, pointless \u2013 if any officers (or God forbid, Trion) had seen this, both cadets would have been flogged, perhaps even discharged from service entirely. Finally, the combatants broke apart. Though Jessica\u2019s shoulders were squared she was braced, ready for another bout, Lydia started laughing, laughing so hard that only her armour kept her on her feet.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat?\u201d Sang snapped, confused and angry.<br>", " <br>", "Lydia struggled to form words through her laughter. \u201c\u2018Subject shows aberrant aggressive tendencies\u2019,\u201d she said, quoting from her own psychological file. \u201c\u2018Subject is estimated on to be a 3.8 on the Kiener-Wernham social assimilation index. Indelible resistance to authority, unacceptable levels of aggression and a consistent pattern of rejection of social norms and doctrines. Repeated failure to comply with appropriate behaviours. Subject has difficulty forming emotional connections and trust with properly socialized individuals. Frequent association with other ongoing and potential maladaptives. I don\u2019t feel that she would benefit from further counselling. Instead, I\u2019m forced to recommend conscription to Janissary Corps. If this socialization fails to stabilize her, chemical behaviour modification is the only option.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "There was a moment of silence and then a low, buzzing chuckle grated through Jessica\u2019s helm. \u201cYou were only 3.8? I was a 4.2. My headbender said I had severe antagonistic proclivities and impulse control problems.\u201d There was another stretched quietude. \u201cIt\u2019s... it\u2019s not like a conversation,\u201d Sang said at last. \u201cI\u2019m not that bugfuck. I just... every so often, I hear a word. I think. When it\u2019s quiet, when there\u2019s no one else around. It-it feels like the walls start to close in and... I think I hear someone whispering.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat do you hear?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI...\u201d Jessica paused, on the verge of saying more when sickly green-white light washed into the corridor, coming from the room the Janissaries had only just vacated. Washed-out murmurs of sound echoed down the hall. Both cadets looked at each other a moment. Then, cautiously, they walked towards the source.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The ship was old \u2013 that wasn\u2019t any revelation. Grace had known that from the first day she\u2019d been here. She thought it was even older than the initial analysis had indicated, but she had kept the thought to herself. The young woman was even more convinced that she was right \u2013 not in a way that she could prove, but it felt <i>ancient</i>. For all the damage, it didn\u2019t feel forgotten or abandoned. It was simply old. Maybe even older than the colony on Rally. That would put it \u2013 was it possible? \u2013 about two thousand years old. How could it still be operational? Even the Compact struggled to keep a hull spaceworthy for longer than a handful of centuries.<br>", " <br>", "Grace ran her fingers over the computer terminal. Like everything else on this ship, it was scaled for beings of human size. Everything about this ship was... familiar. The angles, the shapes, the architecture. It didn\u2019t have the sweeping grandeur of Tribune buildings, nor the arched hallways and wide corridors of <i>Bequeathed</i>. Its blue-grey bulkheads and obsidian floors lacked the shifting colours and textures of Builder tastes, but they also didn\u2019t have the stark drabness of the Thoughtful, nor the concomitant ultraviolet splendour.<br>", " <br>", "The terminal was set in a small cabin close to one of the starship\u2019s sensor nodes, a vast melange of scopes that the young woman could only guess at. This station was a small, cramped combination research center and maintenance site. An afterthought, there for any member of the crew to go through the raw data taken in by the sensors in relative solitude or for technicians to run diagnostics on the array. It had no holographic capability; a single large screen bracketed by six smaller monitors were its only displays.<br>", " <br>", "Dust coated the surface and Grace swept the flat of her palm across it, wiping away God-knew how many years of dust and dirt. Static and snow from the screens splashed light across the terminal, filling the room with an inconstant gleam.<br>", " <br>", "She must have touched something; no sooner had her hand moved over the keyboard, then the screen went blank, ready cursors blinking on each. Words in the alien language appeared on the largest screen, some indicator that Grace couldn\u2019t read. She tried to parse their meaning, but languages were not her best skill. As if tired of waiting for her input, the letters changed, turning into another alien script \u2013 one equally incomprehensible. Still lacking a response, the machine altered its script a third time. A fourth. There \u2013 that one was Compact Standard.<br>", " <br>", "&gt;THIS COMPUTER WAS IMPROPERLY SHUT DOWN. DO YOU WISH TO CONTINUE START-UP?<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d Grace mumbled to herself, looking down at the keyboard. The letters had changed there, too. The layout was far from what she was used to, but she found the key it was asking for. With a soft tone, the terminal continued its boot-up sequence. Seconds later, she was staring at a dizzying array of files. There were directories choked with astronomical data \u2013 suns, planets, moons, asteroids and nebulae. More than she could ever have imagined.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou\u2019ve seen so much...\u201d she found herself saying. All these worlds \u2013 there were so many, many more than she had ever dreamed of seeing herself. Most she didn\u2019t even recognize, not even from her astrography classes at the academy. One, though \u2013 she paused over it, frowning. It was a beautiful blue-green world, with masses of golden desert, white ice caps, drifting clouds and the swirling eyes of storms. <i>I know this place.</i> She\u2019d only seen it a handful of times before, in drawings and flitting by during seminars and instructional videos. Her eyes drifted up to the name of the planet, already knowing what she\u2019d see. Vara Tal.<br>", " <br>", "<i>You were there. You saw her home.</i><br>", " <br>", "A familiar ache opened in Grace as she thought of Allyria and the last time the other girl had spoken of home. It seemed like only yesterday, but it had been years ago \u2013 only a week before they\u2019d received their acceptance letters to the Rally Naval Academy. She\u2019d been so anxious as they waited. Allyria had been encouraged to do so by her social worker. Grace had always wanted to see the stars; that Allyria was applying had only cemented her determination. It had been a warm summer\u2019s night. They\u2019d lay beneath the sky, looking up at the shimmering lights of distant suns.<br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cWhich one is Vara?\u201d Grace had asked, breaking the silence. They\u2019d lain in the grass, listening to the calls of birds and the chirping of insects.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Allyria raised one hand, pointing with her little finger at a corner of the sky. \u201cOver there.\u201d There was a catch in her voice that Grace took to be homesickness. \u201cSomewhere.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cIt\u2019ll be different once we graduate,\u201d Grace said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get to see all of these stars ourselves.\u201d She was excited, her voice coming out in a rush. \u201cWe might even be assigned to one of the explorer fleets. Rally\u2019s been getting more and more traffic these last few years \u2013 not just traders or deep-range explorers, but actual scientific expeditions. I\u2019ve heard that one of the Expansion Fleets might even base here to expand the Compact\u2019s borders throughout the Ardeshian Arm.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Allyria\u2019s head-tails twitched in the grass like a carpet of snakes that had been disturbed, but she didn\u2019t say anything.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cAnd once we\u2019re part of the Space Force, we\u2019ll have travel papers. We can go anywhere,\u201d Grace continued. \u201cYou could even visit Vara Tal.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>The other girl made a strangled sound and Grace realized that she\u2019d said something wrong. Allyria never really talked about her home \u2013 only in the most vague terms possible. Grace had always thought that she was just homesick. She lifted herself up on her elbows, looking over at her friend. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a good thing?\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cI...\u201d Allyria turned away from her. \u201cI'm not sure.\"</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Another long silence stretched out between them, but this one wasn\u2019t nearly as comfortable. \u201cI remember,\u201d Allyria said at last, her voice soft. \u201cI remember the rain. It pounded from the skies, beating the plants and grasses flat like a hand pushing down on them. Afterwards, they would rise up again. The <i>esh thetaas</i> would unfurl and fill the air with the scent. Like...\u201d she struggled for an equivalent word. \u201cApricots. Everything smelled alive and wonderful. I loved when it rained. It was like the world was being made new again and every time I could hope that it would wash away...\u201d she trailed off.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cWash away what?\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>\u201cNothing. It doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Allyria replied, almost snapping at Grace. Her features softened and she reached out, stroking one hand across Grace\u2019s cheek and down her back. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Allyria asked, looking up at the sky. \u201cWhere\u2019s Earth?\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>The girl lifted her head to the heavens, a frown creasing her lips. She hadn\u2019t expected the question. \u201cI...\u201d she bit her lip. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</i><br>", " <br>", "Grace watched the world of Vara Tal spinning slowly in front her, astrographic data scrolling languidly past. She stared at it for a long moment and then unclipped her datapad from her waist. \u201cShow me,\u201d she whispered as she searched for a connection port. \u201cShow me what you saw.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "She was eager. Allyria could sense it, a restlessness running through the bulkheads and circuitry of the Angel\u2019s body. A caged animal, waiting to lash out. The Verrish could understand the impulse; Red One had been built from the ground up to kill, to hunt down her prey and butcher them, a predator cloaked in battle steel. Her \u2018long war\u2019 had only distilled that impulse to its bare essence. Every moment spent waiting was one in which she was not giving vent to her rage.<br>", " <br>", "Allyria could relate. She looked down at her hands, her blunted claws extending from their sheathes. She remembered the sneering face of the first Tribune she\u2019d slashed with them. She\u2019d been a child, heading back to her hated foster home after school, fighting back tears with every step. She\u2019d hated Rally. The way it smelled, the alien tint of its sky and its plants. The people. The humans \u2013 they hadn\u2019t been anything like the stories. They moved wrong, they kept their eyes down when one of the <i>asla hiek</i> \u2013 the Tribunes \u2013 spoke to them. She hated the way her foster mother fretted and fussed, trying to make her fit in. It wasn\u2019t her home. It never would be.<br>", " <br>", "She hadn\u2019t been paying attention and with only a grating chuckle as a warning, found herself pushed down into the mud. Thir was gazing down at her, his lips drawn back over his teeth in an Tribune\u2019s ever-present sneer of superiority. He was talking but she wasn\u2019t listening.<br>", " <br>", "She\u2019d felt her claws slide out. Her foster parents hadn\u2019t yet known how to file them down enough. She looked back at the <i>asla</i>\u2019s ugly, four-eyed face and then...<br>", " <br>", "Yes, she understood Red One\u2019s desires very well.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou\u2019re handling her differently than the others,\u201d the Verrish said. She didn\u2019t need indicate whom she was talking about.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d the ship answered. \u201cI believe this will be more likely to get the response,\u201d she hesitated so briefly that any casual listener would not have noticed anything, \u201cwe want.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Allyria bit the inside of her lip, her tintas flexing. The Angel had almost said \u2018you\u2019. \u201cI hope so,\u201d was all she could say. \u201cI hope so.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "With a flicker of light, the ship\u2019s avatar appeared next to the young woman. Red\u2019s lips thinned and she looked over at the Verrish, a strange expression on her face. \u201cI do too,\u201d an immortal said, her voice rough with the unfamiliar emotion.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cEmissary,\u201d the bastion leader nodded in a greeting that was almost respectful.<br>", " <br>", "Echo tipped her head in acknowledgment as she entered Renan\u2019s office, her minder following behind her and taking up a position just inside the room. There were a pair of other Tribunes waiting for her, one in a Fleet Command uniform, a group leader\u2019s rank bars on his collar. The other was Janissary officer \u2013 an ideologue. \u201cGroup Leader Desren Gyr Chren Nbi Dul Vem,\u201d she said. \u201cCommanding officer, <i>Black Arrow</i> and provisional commander of the Veiled Archer strike group. Ideologue Volk Naush Trey Jdau. Commands the 2,911th Janissary Company under Demagogue Izil\u2019tza, <i>Black Arrow</i>.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The group leader\u2019s eyes widened slightly and Echo smiled, letting her teeth show. \u201cI have made it a point to familiarize myself with all the officers of Execution Force Renan,\u201d she said in answer to the unspoken question. In point of fact, she had reviewed the personnel files of every single officer, noncom and soldier in the entire fleet but there was no need to tell them <i>that</i>, was there? No.<br>", " <br>", "For his part, Renan showed no reaction to her parlour trick. \u201cI have decided to modify the operational plan,\u201d the bastion leader without further attempt at niceties. He didn\u2019t mention that some of those alterations were Echo\u2019s idea. \u201cYou can do it?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "This question again. At least it wasn\u2019t for the bastion leader\u2019s benefit. She\u2019d already proven her capabilities to his satisfaction. Still, there wasn\u2019t an instant of hesitation before she gave her answer. \u201cI can do it,\u201d Echo asserted. She licked her teeth. She could do so much more but for her chains. Thinking of this mission, it made her... hungry, awakening some need inside her. Some craving \u2013 some <i>instinct</i>, as amusing as that descriptor was. \u201cI can do it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "There was an eagerness to the human\u2019s voice that seemed out of place, but Renan put it from his mind for the moment and turned to look at Desren. \u201cThere, you see?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The younger man did not look convinced. He stalked forward and circled Echo, his nostrils twitching. \u201cIt can do this?\u201d he said to Renan. \u201cForgive me, bastion leader. I do not mean to question your word but this... creature can carry out such a function?\u201d He gestured offhandedly to Echo. He wasn\u2019t even speaking Standard in front of her, assuming she didn\u2019t know the Tribunes\u2019 own tongue. \u201cI beg forgiveness for my incredulity, but trusting in a human\u2019s capability leaves me cold.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Echo rose her head defiantly. \u201cThis creature,\u201d she said perfect Oada\u2019vam. \u201cCan do it better than anyone else in the fleet that you care to name.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Desren\u2019s head snapped around, his lips drawing back from his teeth in a sneer. Caught out in his little trick, surprise quickly gave way to righteous indignation. \u201cYou won\u2019t speak the words of your betters in my presence, Broken.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI will speak what I wish,\u201d Echo replied. \u201cAnd you will listen when I do.\u201d Her expression was neutral, but there was a light in her eyes... some twisted amusement, as if she were actually challenging the group leader.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d Renan interrupted, speaking in Compact Standard. He regarded Desren coolly. \u201cYou were not brought here for a debate, group leader and certainly not for an argument. If this mission is to be successful, the emissary has a function that she cannot fulfill aboard my ship. You are to consider her a mission specialist for your part in the operation, group leader and one who does have <i>some</i> understanding of our objectives.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOf course,\u201d chastised, Desren lowered his head in acknowledgement.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cGood. This human was chosen by a Triarch itself to be its emissary. I will not have our leader\u2019s will challenged by a mere group leader.\u201d Renan continued, shooting a warning glare at Echo, who simply blinked, her expression utterly blank. \u201cThis Broken is deeply irritating. It is insubordinate, irreverent and defiant. It is also very capable and it speaks with the authority of the Triarchs, so you <i>will</i> listen.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Renan\u2019s voice softened. \u201cYou are my finest strike wing commander, group leader. I will need your ships and your skill for this mission. I understand what I am asking of you, but if you feel you cannot carry out this mission under these constraints, I must know now.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI hear you, patron,\u201d Desren answered, though his gaze was locked on Echo, \u201cand I obey. I know my duty and I will not let my feelings interfere.\u201d He finally looked away from the small female. \u201cI apologize for my lack of control. I do not have... much experience with such things.\u201d He did not, however, apologize to the emissary herself.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAnd you,\u201d Echo said, cocking her head at ideologue Volk. \u201cYou\u2019re here to make sure I stay I alive.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Volk grinned, the gesture nothing but teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s so, emissary.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou served in the 1,913rd.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAye, with the Aberrants. Your blood did well. They breached Iyken Kar\u2019s walls. Died to the last, but they held long enough for the rest of use to get inside.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "There was a flash of something on the human\u2019s face, there and gone so quickly that Renan couldn\u2019t identify it. Pride in her kin? Grief at their passing? He doubted it. Anger at those that had sent them to their deaths? Also unlikely, but possible. \u201cThe ideologue will personally lead your escort,\u201d Renan informed the Broken. \u201cAdvocate, submissive Tenem will also be accompanying you.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "She smiled at that. \u201cGood. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without my loyal hound at my heels.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The submissive stirred, but made no further indication that he\u2019d heard his ward. The female raised her head. \u201cWhen can I board?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Desren coughed into his hand. \u201c<i>Black Arrow</i> has no human crew. We will need to prepare suitable quarters and take on provisions to meet your needs, emissary.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe will attack Yulzhak Daun in three days,\u201d Renan rumbled. \u201cYou will join the Veiled Archers shortly. Until then, we,\u201d the Tribune flag officer managed not to grind his teeth as he said this. \u201cwill use your skills here, emissary.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cVery well,\u201d Echo made a salute to the assembled officers, one as perfect in form as it was hollow in intent. \u201cIf you have nothing else for me, I will return to my work.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Renan nodded in dismissal. As soon as the doors closed behind her, Desren turned to his superior. \u201cI will obey,\u201d he affirmed. \u201cBut I wish it noted that I object in the harshest possible terms to this.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNoted, initiate,\u201d Renan grunted. \u201cJust be sure to sever all non-vital connections when she carries out that phase of the mission.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The group leader nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI apologize if I overstep myself, patron... but did the Triarch say <i>why</i> this Broken is under such restrictions?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d Renan replied, keeping his suspicions to himself. \u201cJust be ready to follow your orders should it be necessary.\u201d He cast a sidelong glance at Volk. \u201cDo you understand, ideologue?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d the Janissary replied, one hand drifting to rest on the butt of the gun on his hip. \u201cBut I don\u2019t need to.\u201d</div>"]}

He had been laughing for several minutes, his face etched with grief and exhaustion, but he barely felt anything. It had all been burned out of him over the last few days. The few patchwork squads that he\u2019d cobbled together from Invida\u2019s survivors were barricaded throughout the control room. Less than thirty survivors from a force of seven thousand. There were no civilians with him here. There weren\u2019t any civilians left. He\u2019d had one job. A simple job. Protect the workers.<br>", " <br>", "He\u2019d failed. In fact, he\u2019d failed from the first day he\u2019d set foot on this rock but that made the lack of even a single civilian here no easier to accept.<br>", " <br>", "His hands ached, throbbing with pain. He was sure that several of his fingers we broken. He couldn\u2019t remember when that had happened. It might have been when the barracks was overrun, when he\u2019d heard the people he\u2019d swore an oath to protect screaming, when he\u2019d beat at the doors as if he could batter them down himself. Had that only been two days ago? He wasn\u2019t sure.<br>", " <br>", "They were looking to him, his lost hope, waiting for his orders. It was funny, really. He\u2019d murdered a superior in front of them. His armour was spattered with the blood of Invida Station\u2019s commanding officer and they were <i>still</i> looking to him. That was funny, maybe the funniest thing he\u2019d ever thought. By the Triarchs, that was hilarious. That was why he was laughing.<br>", " <br>", "There was a dull thud as the outer blast doors were breached and the armoured plating fell inwards. Nasham saw the metal grow warmer and brighter in several places on the inner security door as the attackers began to burn through it. He could hear the skittering of Scarabs as they scuttled over the bulkheads, gnawing at the doors as their larger kin sheared their way through metal that could stop anti-tank rounds. It wouldn\u2019t be long.<br>", " <br>", "Finally Nasham stopped laughing, although his mouth was still pulled up an adrenalin-fuelled rictus. There was an ugly, unhinged gleam in his eyes. He stood, holding his gun over one shoulder. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, stepping over the body of Column Leader Prime Yiven (and seven names besides). \u201cIt looks like we\u2019ve got one last scrap. Not too much trouble.\u201d He nodded to each of the men and women before him. Like him, they were wounded, tired and afraid. Some still had a spark of hope, but most stared back at him with hollow gazes, waiting for the end. Like him, they were empty inside. It had all been too much. Too much death. Too many retreats. Too much loss and all of it for nothing. Every man and woman had their breaking point. These were ones that hadn\u2019t broken, the ones that had seen their comrades surrender to fear, the ones that had fed every scrap of themselves to the emptiness just to stay alive a few days, a few hours, a few minutes longer.<br>", " <br>", "Considering how well things had gone, that was pretty damn funny itself.<br>", " <br>", "Nasham could feel the heat pouring off the door, molten bubbles of metal running down to pool on the deck. He didn\u2019t have any rousing speeches to give, anything to inspire them beyond what they already had: making their killers pay for their deaths. He was proud of them for that. He\u2019d never been prouder of any soldier than the ones in this room. \u201cMake them bleed,\u201d he said. There were a few dry chuckles at that. \u201cJust make sure that when we get to the gates of Hell, you let me do the talking.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "A weary chorus of laughter ran through the group. A few nodded, a few others added their own affirmations or shallow jokes. They were ready, as ready as they would ever be. Nasham nodded. <i>You\u2019ve all done the Compact proud,</i> he wanted to say, but there was no time. They knew, even if no one else did. That was all that mattered.<br>", " <br>", "The enemy had almost burnt through the door. The metal groaned as something massive pressed against it, ready to smash it aside. The officer raised his weapon, nodding to Convert Radan as she hefted her grenade launcher. Radan had only two rounds left, but that would be enough to stem the tide for a second or two.<br>", " <br>", "Just before it came down and Nasham\u2019s world shattered into the sounds of gunfire and the screams of the dying, he had one last cogent thought.<br>", " <br>", "<i>We are the toys of the gods.</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Earlier:<br>", " <br>", "Group Leader, Submissive Asea Thurn Ilk Yin hurried to catch up with Nasham as he strode through Invida Station. \u201cTell me that you\u2019re not going to do what I think you\u2019re going to do,\u201d she said as she caught up to the other submissive. Like her, he was young for his rank, but both of them had family connections, although Asea\u2019s bloodline was waxing while her counterpart\u2019s was ascendant.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSomeone has to,\u201d Nasham snapped. \u201cThis is the third time this month. We\u2019re averaging a fatality a week, Asea \u2013 does that sound reasonable?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re losing the upper echelons...\u201d Asea began, wincing when she realized what she\u2019d said. Despite his family\u2019s ties to the Compact\u2019s highest strata society, Nasham was something of a prodigal son.<br>", " <br>", "Nasham rounded on her, jabbing one finger at his peer. His teeth clicked with each syllable. \u201cIt\u2019s <i>obscene</i>, Asea. I don\u2019t care that they\u2019re only client races. You shouldn\u2019t either. Yiven is working them to death.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWell... not literally...\u201d the young woman realized she\u2019d fumbled <i>that</i> response too when Nasham\u2019s nostril\u2019s flared angrily.<br>", " <br>", "He spun on his heel and stormed back up the corridor, Asea hurrying to catch him. \u201cWe\u2019re under a tight schedule here, Nasham,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cWithout the automatics...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThat\u2019s another thing \u2013 why, in all the Black names are we using <i>manual labour</i> to excavate this site?\u201d Nasham snapped at her without breaking stride. \u201cWe\u2019re sending over-worked dig and salvage teams into the ruins and we\u2019re getting them killed. For what?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s classified.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham growled. \u201cMy job is to oversee security in my department. It\u2019s not to watch a parade of exhausted wretches get mutilated and killed and that is <i>exactly</i> what Yiven is doing. I do not accept a pat on the head as payment for burial shrouds. You shouldn\u2019t either.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s not my division,\u201d Asea reminded her comrade. \u201cI\u2019m satisfied with the orders I receive and the knowledge that if I needed to know something, I would be informed of it. I <i>know</i> I am doing my duty and doing it well. I don\u2019t have to bleed from my eyes for every careless <i>iliz dur</i> that falls down an open elevator shaft. We need bodies on this operation, Nasham. Whatever\u2019s down there, Command wants it dug out and dug out now. Would you feel better if those burial shrouds were covering Builders? Thoughtful? Tribunes?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The young male glowered at his friend. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo, but it\u2019s what is. It\u2019s either them or us,\u201d Asea sniffed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see <i>anyone</i> fed into a meat grinder, but this is a dangerous operation and if someone does have to die, I\u2019d rather it be one of the lesser races. That\u2019s what they\u2019re here for.\u201d At the look in Nasham\u2019s eyes, the woman stiffened, baring her teeth slightly. \u201cThat soft liver of yours is going to get you in trouble,\u201d Asea warned, growing angry herself. \u201cYiven\u2019s given you a lot of slack because of your family, but if you keep pushing him, you\u2019re going to end up on the wrong side of a court-martial. Have you thought about that?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham nodded, but he did not slow down. \u201cYes.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Asea paused, watching her friend continue on his way up the corridor. She opened her mouth to speak, but with a mental shrug and a shake of her head, the other Tribune turned away.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAh, submissive Nasham,\u201d Column Leader Prime Yiven said as he caught sight of the younger man. \u201cI do pride myself on an open-door policy, but when junior officers abuse that privilege, I become rather cholorous. What has aroused such an urgent need to see me?\u201d <i>As if I didn\u2019t know.</i><br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe had another fatality today. This one in Jax Sector. A dig team was breaching one of the sealed doors and triggered a pressure mine. It killed Epigone Ingex\u2019l and severely wounded two other Yttrian workers.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Yiven leaned forward in his chair, his upper eyes closed. His expression was plain enough to read: <i>Why are you telling me this?</i> When the prime did not comment, Nasham continued. \u201cThose casualties would have been averted if the work team had been allowed to conduct a proper entry. Instead, as per your directions, they went in with all speed and we\u2019ve lost another worker permanently. Two more will be useless for the better part of a month until their limbs grow back. If they weren\u2019t Yttrian, we\u2019d lose them for even longer.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThis is a dangerous business. All personnel were made aware of that.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe could have diggers clearing the ruins in a fifth the time it\u2019s taken us with manual labour,\u201d Nasham pointed out. \u201cThis is a waste of lives, material and time.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cForce Command doesn\u2019t seem to think so,\u201d Yiven said acidly. \u201cI remind you, our orders come from the highest authority. Do you believe that you know better than your superiors?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI...\u201d Nasham paused, then bowed his head in contrition. \u201cI do not. I merely have concerns, patron. It is difficult to be ordered to ensure the safety of others and yet have to see them die day by day when they do not have to.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Yiven tapped his fingers on the surface of his desk. \u201cI understand, submissive. But the fact remains that we have been given a directive. Our concerns do not enter into the situation; only our obedience. Those who die, die for the greater good of the Compact and the surety of their species\u2019s future. Those deaths are unfortunate, but they are inevitable. Remember the dictums of command: once an officer has accepted that people will die from his orders, he is free from the responsibility of those orders. The success of his mission is all that matters. We have been given a directive and so we carry it out.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI am aware of our duty, patron,\u201d Nasham replied. He wasn\u2019t <i>quite</i> insubordinate. Not yet, anyways. Yiven tapped his fingers again over the finely-polished surface of his desk.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThen you understand that we must do everything in our ability to follow it. Even things that that we might otherwise find distasteful.\u201d He saw the expression on the submissive\u2019s face and arched an eyebrow. \u201cYou disagree?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cForgive me, patron but I\u2019ve heard those words to justify every imaginable excess, even to violate the Articles of the Compact.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cCareful, initiate,\u201d Yiven warned, a touch of anger entering his voice. The drumming of the prime\u2019s fingers increased in force and speed. \u201cThe Articles of the Compact,\u201d he mused aloud. \u201cAre a fine ideal to strive for, but all too often they fall short of reality. When the Betrayers showed their true nature, when they turned against the Triarchs, the Articles did not help, did they? When we encountered the ambition, the deviousness and deceit of the Principality, the Articles had no answer for us. When we discovered the racial insanity of the Broken, the Articles could give us no insight. They are a fine ideal,\u201d he repeated. \u201cBut they are just that. If we were to shackle ourselves blindly to such... unfettered optimism, the Compact would have fallen long ago.\u201d Yiven stood, clasping his hands behind his back.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI appreciate your honesty, group leader, submissive. Your forthrightness and idealism are refreshing, but they are untempered by experience. Yes, my orders have resulted in the deaths of our labour crews, just as the orders you pass along have. I take no pleasure in these losses and I do not seek them out, but I will order them. For the good of the Compact, for the duty I swore to it, to the future I believe in and the trust I hold in those above me. We may never know what their designs are, but we do not need to. We obey. That is our place, that is our duty, that is our privilege and our honour.\u201d He strode around his desk, meeting his subordinate\u2019s eyes. \u201cRemember the wisdom of the Compact, the doctrines that you were schooled in and the lessons of our history. Acknowledge your role and your duty and be aware that all that we do, we do for the sake of others. We cannot balance a handful of lives against the designs and intentions of our superiors. We do not have the right to make that decision.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBear this in mind in future, initiate. Your bloodline buys you some slack, but that is all. I trust that this will be the last I hear of this matter.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham\u2019s ears twitched, but he nodded in submission, looking away from Yiven\u2019s gaze.\u201dYes, patron.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Nasham\u2019s breath rasped in his ears, a toxicity alarm ticking pointedly on his suit\u2019s HUD as he followed the guide lights through the ancient ruins. The entire area was contaminated with radiation and chemical residue so thick that even the slightest unprotected exposure was potentially fatal. As the pack leader moved through the corridors, he saw far too many radiation badges scarred nearly black and he forced himself not to grind his teeth, though he gritted his jaw so fiercely it ached. <i>Remember your duty,</i> he reminded himself, although those words seemed to come through in Yiven\u2019s patronizing sneer.<br>", " <br>", "The submissive carefully stepped over a sheeted body. The ancient outpost\u2019s own power core had died long ago; the only illumination came from the floodlights the work teams had set up at intersections or strung along the walls, guide strips pulsing to keep workers from becoming lost in the toxic maze of pitch-black rooms, rubble-choked corridors and forgotten booby-traps. Flooded chambers waited to spill out torrents of contaminated and radioactive fluids, undetected faults in power conduits resulted in overloads and fires \u2013 a host of other hazards filled this warren.<br>", " <br>", "This part of the ruins had been a dormitory; there were many dead here, the atmosphere so terribly lethal that even the normal slew of microbial life and decomposing bacteria had been killed or driven into dormancy, leaving the corpses very well-preserved. As the work crews pumped out the toxic air and filtered it, the process of rot had begun. The dead were being taken away before decomposition could fully set in, but there were so many and so few free workers that it was pushing against the tide. A maintenance drone, just as old as the bodies around it, lay slumped against another wall, its chest perforated by multiple rounds and its head pulverised by repeated blows from a Janissary\u2019s power maul. Both CPUs had been utterly destroyed.<br>", " <br>", "This place... it was Invida Station, too. The <i>first</i> Invida station, abandoned and forgotten for nineteen centuries, covered by millions of tons of rock when a mountain had been shattered atop it. <i>It should have stayed buried,</i> Nasham thought as he avoided a line of sheet-covered bodies, pausing to watch a pair of nearby workers, trying not to note the exhaustion in their eyes. They were hosing down the walls, just one of many teams working to decontaminate this section. Once the worst of it had been washed away, the second stage of clean-up would begin.<br>", " <br>", "One of hazmat team paused, wiping the chemical grime from her faceplate. They watched Nasham pass, one making an almost-salute towards the officer. The submissive nodded curtly and continued on his way, feeling his liver boil. They were almost dead on their feet and still working. This was inexcusable.<br>", " <br>", "There was nothing down here that could justify this, yet every message from Yiven demanded more work, faster results. More safety measures were ignored, the crews running on stimulants and inertia. They were getting sloppier and more mistakes were being made, but all he could give them was a taskmaster\u2019s decree: continue. Just yesterday, one of Nasham\u2019s security troops had had to rescue a Didact; she\u2019d been too exhausted to properly inspect a room before entering. A fleshcutter bomb had gone off, an ugly weapon that bounced into the air before sending out a spray of shrapnel. Both the Didact\u2019s legs had been sliced off just below the knees. Only convert prime Yuku\u2019s quick response had saved the woman.<br>", " <br>", "It should have been a joke or a mark of pride that Compact technology was reliable enough to function after centuries. Nasham had even heard some of his men making those same comments, laughing as they pantomimed the bomb bouncing into the air. He\u2019d reported the incident, of course, even though he knew what the response was going to be.<br>", " <br>", "Continue.<br>", " <br>", "Nasham paused by the fallen form of a Janissary in full power armour. He wiped away the dust over the shoulder\u2019s unit patch. Squad Xeros. This was the second member fallen in this section and the eighth throughout the entire complex. They weren\u2019t simple station security, not with the weaponry they\u2019d been carrying. A clean-up team, sent to contain whatever had happened here. Looking up the hall from where the Xeros Janissary had fallen, Nasham could guess.<br>", " <br>", "Less than a decade after this facility had been scratched, the Compact had banned the use of autonomous combat drones. All militarized robots had to either have a remote organic operator; those that ran off a gestalt were severely limited. No networking capability was allowed and their intelligence was severely restricted. Like the cause of the Janissary\u2019s death, it was not a difficult puzzle to put together. There was no song of it, no easy catchphrase like the Principality\u2019s Rains of Oshanta, but something awful had been birthed here, so horrifying that a mountain had been brought down atop this place to bury it forever.<br>", " <br>", "<i>And yet, here I am.</i><br>", " <br>", "Further up the corridor, a combat drone leaned back against the bulkhead like it was napping, the melted ruin of its head sagging down over its pitted and cratered chest. This was not the first time Nasham had seen this. The machines of Invida Station had gone mad. No one spoke of it, save in hushed whispers that ended whenever he or another officer was near, but they all knew. A machine had gone mad here.<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune continued picking his way through the corridor, past more bodies, more tired workers and another dead Janissary from Xeros. This one\u2019s armour was different \u2013 some kind of technical specialist. Her chest had been almost completely vapourized by a blast from an anti-armour weapon. Her killer lay in pieces \u2013 a heavy combat unit, blown apart when someone had wedged a anti-tank grenade into its chest cavity, avenging their comrade. Just ahead was his destination, Invida Station\u2019s seventh computer hub, one of the brains for the entire computer network that had run the colony. The workers hadn\u2019t even needed to force the doors open; what was left of them was ajar.<br>", " <br>", "Nasham stepped over the pile of debris at the threshold, striding into the server room. Crumpled on the floor, only a few feet from the central computer hub was Xeros Squad\u2019s tenth and final member, a convert prime whose nameplate had been erased by weapons fire. That wasn\u2019t what had killed him; the deep holes punched in his back had done that. They\u2019d been driven in with commendable force, downing the Janissary as he\u2019d raised his carbine towards the rows of servers and the hub itself. The wounds hadn\u2019t been immediately lethal, but with his spine shattered, the Janissary could have done nothing but bleed out, unable to so much as raise his weapon. He\u2019d died here, just meters from his goal, seconds from victory.<br>", " <br>", "His killer was sprawled against on the ground next to the core, amidst a tangle of limbs. In a parody of the deaths outside, several drones had crawled in here to die, opening themselves up and connecting their power sources to the core, keeping it alive as others had set up a series of generators and a tap to the colony\u2019s main reactor. They had fed the computer everything to make sure it stayed alive as long as possible, until it had starved and shut down, quiescent.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Waiting</i>.<br>", " <br>", "Nasham felt his liver clench at the implications of that. He had the sudden urge to order everyone from this chamber, fill it with explosives, set a timer and walk away. Every instinct, every belief, every doctrine told him that this was the only right, the only <i>sane</i> thing to do. To evacuate the colony and order Orbital to pound this site until nothing remained \u2013 until nothing <i>could</i> remain \u2013 but a crater filled with molten stone and vitrified sand.<br>", " <br>", "Unfortunately, his duty demanded otherwise.<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune stood next to the octagonal central hub, a forest of wires connecting it to the server nodes, reaching up into the ceiling where they would find their way to the destroyed computer core above. And the one above that. And the one above that. Two thousand years ago, this colony had had more processing power than an entire battlefleet. Catching his attention, Faithful Nav-am-desh saluted the Tribune. \u201cPatron. Yes. Security issue. Informed you,\u201d the Builder bubbled eagerly, the translator built into his suit giving coherence to the faithful\u2019s normal vocalizations.<br>", " <br>", "Nasham returned the Builder\u2019s salute. \u201cInitiate.\u201d He looked towards the massive computer core. \u201cThis is the artefact you\u2019ve found?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d beneath his faceplate, the Builder\u2019s bioluminescent skin patches flared brightly with excitement. \u201cInspection indicates hardware without major fault or damage. Original hardlines disconnected. System is connected,\u201d the faithful gestured to a holo-screen frame hooked into the central hub. \u201cThis display for direct access. Yes. System intact. Dusty but cleaning. Preparing to power-up the system. Awaiting authorization. Informed you for security reasons.\u201d Nav-am-desh nodded \u2013 rather he made a passable attempt at the gestured \u2013 towards a group of ratings who were busily disconnecting one of the ancient, drained generators and hooking the power cable up to a new one. \u201cGenerator new, better than older versions. Yes. Should provide sufficient energy for system restart,\u201d the Builder burbled, his voice wet and phlegmy. \u201cBring computer back on-line. Access data. Mission success, yes?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham bit his lower lip as he circled the computer core, carefully picking his way through the tangle of cords and drained bodies. The core was large. Enough storage space that the records of entire civilizations could be stored here with room left over, enough processing power to run half a dozen of the most advanced and intuitive gestalts at once. He reached out and ran a finger over the layer of dust that had accumulated on the device, turning to look at the rest of the colony\u2019s servers, all of them feeding back into this one single point. Invida station\u2019s last remaining brain, the only remaining records of the experiments that had been conducted here. Priceless data that Yiven and Force Command desperately wanted.<br>", " <br>", "It was tainted, all of it. Nasham knew he wasn\u2019t alone in that assessment; someone had tried to destroy this place once before. Xeros had died to the last in making that attempt. Two thousand years ago, a thousand men and women had died on this colony and then a dozen more had been slaughtered in the attempt to bury what was in this ugly metal tin and keep it buried for all time. He looked over at the faithful, the Builder\u2019s bulging eyes anxious behind his faceplate, his pseudohands working over one another as he waited for his superior\u2019s command.<br>", " <br>", "The only order Nasham wanted to give was to finish what Xeros had start, but he didn\u2019t have that option. \u201cI will inform Column Leader Prime Yiven of what you\u2019ve found,\u201d he said instead. \u201cHe will decide what happens next.\u201d <i>And may the gods grants us fortune\u2019s blessings, rather than her wit.</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The elevator rattled as it carried him down to the lowest level.<br>", " <br>", "The last message from Force Command had been, as ever, polite and strongly-worded, emphasizing the need for further haste in the operations, just like every other communiqu\u00e9 Yiven had received. This latest one was different; it was just short of hysteria. You would never know it from a cursory read, but Yiven had been writing and reading far too many of these messages for too long not to notice the shift in tone. Something had happened and Command was badly spooked. They were sending him a ship, the <i>Unmatchable Deed</i>. As soon as the package was acquired, it would be loaded aboard the vessel. Yiven knew that vessel; it was one of the newest <i>Breathless Speed</i> courier-cruisers, fast beyond all measure both at sublight and when shocking. They had only recently begun to dribble off the production lines and one\u2019s deployment to Invida spoke volumes.<br>", " <br>", "Yiven adjusted his respirator\u2019s airflow as he waited for the clanking elevator car to descend, his armsmen a comforting presence. He didn\u2019t believe that there was anything lurking in the dark, but he had seen the images his work teams had sent up. He had read the mission reports. He knew precisely what had happened to Invida Station all those centuries ago and if he... shaded the truth of just how much he knew from his underlings, it was for their own good. There were, after all, things that people were simply not ready to know.<br>", " <br>", "The prime took a deep breath through his nostrils, smelling the recycled air of his suit and his own sweat mixed with the atmosphere of Invida Station\u2019s previous incarnation. The air down here was still dangerous to breathe freely and despite his respirator\u2019s best efforts, there was a chemical acridity to it that burned his sinuses and threatened to provoke a coughing fit. A touch of decomposition was there too as the bodies laid out in rows slowly rotted, despite the best efforts of the crews to clear them all away. Yiven suppressed the urge to gag on the tainted atmosphere, switching back to his suit\u2019s internal supply. He would need to do so anyways, once they reached their destination. As if on cue, with a muted <i>ping</i>, the car shuddered to a halt, its doors grinding open and Yiven stalked out into the bowels of Invida Station\u2019s murdered predecessor.<br>", " <br>", "<i>This,</i> the prime thought sourly. <i>This is price of our treasure.</i> His Invida Station had been built upon the dead, twenty thousand souls living above a mass grave. He didn\u2019t know what Command wanted with the \u2018package\u2019, but he did not need to. He obeyed. As he had told Nasham, that was his duty, his honour and his privilege. Soon enough, he\u2019d reached the server room.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cConfirm that all hardlines to the rest of the station have been severed and that there is nothing here it can wirelessly link to,\u201d he said without preamble as he strode into the ancient server hub. The engineers scrambled to obey, quickly ascertaining that the central computer core was isolated from all subsidiary systems. As he waited, Yiven took in the server room, his gaze drifting past the handful of junior officers present. All but one were trying to look equally important and inconspicuous in the presence of a flag officer.<br>", " <br>", "Group Leader, Submissive Nasham (and six names besides) was the exception, the younger male staying close by one of the work teams and looking towards Yiven with an evaluative expression, clearly wondering about the breadth of his superior\u2019s knowledge of this place. Well, let him wonder. \u201cAll connections are closed,\u201d the submissive reported. \u201cAll link ports are inactive. Generator is active.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Yiven nodded curtly. \u201cYou may begin the power-up sequence.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The technicians closed the final circuit and with a dull tone, the computer signalled that it was beginning to start up, greedily sucking in energy. The status screen the techs had hooked up flickered to life, numbers and letters running by as the system carried out diagnostics. Finally, the screen went black, a single blinking cursor appearing. A moment passed and then a single line of text appeared:<br>", " <br>", "<i>where am I?</i><br>", " <br>", "Yiven inhaled sharply, ignoring the sudden babble of comments from the assembled workers, officers and engineers. \u201cGet out,\u201d he ordered. \u201cAll of you.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "It was over an hour before Yiven came out of the hub room. Nasham cocked his head ever so slightly as he regarded the flag officer. Yiven was trying to hide it, but the older man was unsettled, his face drawn and a jerkiness to his motions that spoke volumes. He was holding something in one clenched fist, so tightly that Nasham couldn\u2019t see what it was. \u201cThe work crews will be given seven hours to rest,\u201d Yiven said. \u201cThen this core will be extracted \u2013 <i>intact</i> \u2013 up to the surface and prepared for loading. Extreme caution is to be exercised at all times in handling this item. I remind all of you that you are not to speak of this to <i>anyone</i>, not even among each other. No records are to be made, no notations in journals or work logs. This chamber was void of anything of value. Failure to comply with these edicts will considered willful sedition and be met with the harshest possible penalties. Is that understood?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Without further ado, he strode off back down the corridor, his armsmen falling in behind him.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIs this what we came here for, patron?\u201d Nasham called after him.<br>", " <br>", "Yiven paused, though he did not look back. \u201cYes, initiate. It is.\u201d He hesitated a question before deciding to answer Nasham\u2019s unspoken question. \u201cAnd it is worth the price we have paid.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The younger man said nothing as he watched the prime take his leave. Yiven may have claimed that this thing was worth the blood price they\u2019d paid... but Nasham had caught the waver in his leader\u2019s voice. He glanced back into the empty room and found his hand straying towards the pistol at his hip.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Nasham watched as the package was loaded on the shuttle. His security teams were fanned out across the tarmac, ensuring that the handoff to <i>Unmatchable Deed</i>\u2019s own personnel went as smoothly as possible. The young officer adjusted the scarf over his snout as a gust of wind rolled across the open concrete field, carrying a fair amount of sand with it. There were already piles of dirt building up around the shuttle\u2019s landing struts.<br>", " <br>", "It was taking two heavy lifters operated by the best port workers Invida had to carry the massive device over to the cargo shuttle. The device had been sealed within a heavy, well-armoured canister, several times the height of a man and easily weighing thousands of pounds. The core had never been intended to be moved; like its ruined brothers left in the bowels of the old Invida Station, it had been shipped to the fledgling colony piecemeal, assembled and activated on site. It would have saved a great deal of time to take it apart, but Yiven had expressly forbade such an action. Nasham patted the butt of his pistol again, although he knew it was a foolish thing to do. Still... it was reassuring.<br>", " <br>", "That innocuous slab of metal housed an abomination. Nasham couldn\u2019t fathom why Command had had this thing created, nor why they wanted it back after nearly two millennia. He couldn\u2019t imagine what need could be so great as to require a \u2018neverborn\u2019, nor did he want to. In this, he was satisfied in his ignorance. The machine would be taken from Invida, greater minds would deal with it and Group Leader, Submissive Nasham Kem Unoth Ludhy Inku Pram Voy would be able to shake the dust from this cursed world from the soles of his feet.<br>", " <br>", "As the package was secured inside its bay, the shuttle rose into the atmosphere, a powerful downdraft of hot air from its thrusters rolled across the tarmac, battling the gusts of arid wind. Nasham closed his eyes, letting the warmth wash over him and imagining a day, not too long from now, when he would be boarding his own shuttle to leave Invida and its ghosts behind forever.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Invida Orbital was an <i>Inviolable Belief</i> citadel, intended to defend valuable worlds, vital trading posts, historically significant sites and other important territories. In its prime, it had done just that. But now it was like a faded damsel, no longer invited to the fine galas of her youth. Now, even its name had been stripped from it, bestowed upon a younger and more powerful citadel, while it remained an uninspiring serial number or the equally unimaginative \u2018Invida Orbital\u2019.<br>", " <br>", "Although Group Leader Dansin (and four names besides) believed that his station still had many more years of loyal service to the Compact left, he would have been prepared to claim that if Command believed the citadel was needed here, then here was where it would serve... at least, until he had received the transfer papers granting him dominion of this bastion. Now, he was more adamant that Invida Station deserved more than this pointless garrison duty.<br>", " <br>", "Truthfully, despite its age and faded vigour, Dansin had no idea what the orbital was doing here above this worthless speck of dirt. Invida was an arid, wind-swept wasteland. Not enough mineral wealth to justify full-scale mining, not enough interesting life to hold an exobiologist\u2019s interest for more than a week or two. Barely habitable, the planet was on the edge of the system\u2019s life zone, with an elliptical orbit that either saw it being roasted by the system\u2019s primary and scourged by continent-sweeping sandstorms or freezing in the void of space and whipped by equally massive blizzards. As far as Dansin could tell there was nothing about the colony that justified Invida Orbital\u2019s presence and the small squadron of pickets that constantly plied the system for anything remotely resembling a threat to the wind-blown research colony, their crews as bored as Dansin himself.<br>", " <br>", "Currently, the pickets were amusing themselves by playing war games whose antagonists were increasingly improbable and bizarre. Radio chatter indicated that the last one had involved \u2018nuclear space whales\u2019. Dansin envied them; the most exciting thing he\u2019d dealt with was the arrival and almost immediate departure of the rapid response cruiser, whose name and presence here had been scrubbed from the station\u2019s databanks. Column Leader Prime Yiven\u2019s orders had been very clear; no mentions in personal journals, written accounts or images of <i>Unmatchable Deed</i> were to exist. Even the comm logs in which the order had been given were to be erased entirely. <i>That</i> was unsettling, even more so with the rumours coming up from groundside.<br>", " <br>", "No \u2018research outpost\u2019 needed the kind of firepower Invida Station had. Almost a third of the souls on the ground were Janissaries. They had a squadron of pickets and Invida Orbital. All a place like this needed was at most a single frigate, a waypost and a few hundred Ground Force regulars.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Then again,</i> Dansin mused as he skimmed idly through daily status reports that he\u2019d long since stopped reading. <i>The Red Hand have been pushing into this sector...</i> Maybe their presence here wasn\u2019t so inexplicable.

As she played her hand, there was a chuckle from her fellow players, all of them Janissaries from her squad. This was one of the few periods of downtime her unit had and the unit was making the most of it.<br>", " <br>", "Jessica Sang narrowed her eyes at Telden Squad\u2019s interim leader. \u201cConfront,\u201d she replied, tossing a chit into the pot and she responded to Jameson\u2019s attack, though the game was played more for pride and fun than any money. Sang looked over at the other three members of Telden playing <i>jadaq</i> with her and Jameson. \u201cAre you three going to get in on this or are you just going to watch the girl-girl action?\u201d She\u2019d been the one to introduce the game to the squad; her stepfather had taught it to her. He\u2019d had a taste for card games, right up until he\u2019d won a game against the wrong people. Now, Sang never played <i>jadaq</i> with Tribunes.<br>", " <br>", "Samuel Sully smirked around the unlit stimstick in his mouth. Lydia had never actually seen him light one up, but he always had a pack of them on his person. \u201cNow Jessie, you know I can\u2019t resist an offer like that. Confront.\u201d He flicked a chit into the pot.<br>", " <br>", "Jacob Roundtree bit the inside of his lip. \u201cGetting too rich for me.

They know what\u2019s best, Sam.\u201d Jacob\u2019s jaw set. \u201cI\u2019m here and not in prison because of them. You are, too. They saw potential in us that nobody else did.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Sam looked at the other players for support, but Sang and Lydia wouldn\u2019t meet his eyes and Gerome was tapping his fingers impatiently on the crate, waiting for the game to continue. Sully shrugged. \u201cSorry,\u201d he admitted. \u201cForgot the first rule of Telden <i>jadaq</i>. No politics. Got too carried away.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou always do,\u201d Sang said idly, looking over her cards. \u201cS\u2019why your argumentative ass is a mudfoot.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Sully mock-saluted the girl\u2019s turn of his phrase. \u201cFor true. \u2018Ours not to wonder why, ours but to fight and die\u2019.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBetter than ending up in a behavioural rehabilitation facility,\u201d Reinez observed sourly.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOr with a chem-drip in your head,\u201d Sang said. \u201cNot that some of us couldn\u2019t use one.\u201d She shot a glance over her shoulder at Brandon Yokima and his cohorts, the other clique of Telden squad. Barely more than seventeen, Lee wasn\u2019t the oldest member of their squad, but he was the biggest. He knew it too and liked to throw his weight around. The Tribunes either hadn\u2019t noticed or cared, but Medusa had. Yokima might have been physically imposing to the rest of Telden, but he was still just a human and te Neu had been a Brute.<br>", " <br>", "Naturally, Brandon hated the upperclasswoman and despised every second of her rotations among the Janissaries, not least for the more... relaxed attitude she had towards doctrine. Like Roundtree, he was zealous in his belief in the Compact. Lydia preferred not to get into those kinds of discussions in the first place; it was too easy to slip up.<br>", " <br>", "Yokima saw Sang watching him and smiled, tossing a black lock of hair out of his eyes in a practiced move that irritated Lydia every time she saw him do it. Jessica snorted and turned back to their game, but the young man sauntered over, a hair\u2019s breadth from draping himself over Sang, making the smaller Janissary squirm uncomfortably. \u201cYou see anything you like, <i>jag-eun koch</i>?\u201d \u2018Little flower\u2019. His pet name for Jessica, a mangled pronunciation from a transliteration from some dead pre-Catalclysm human language.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cFuck off, Eight.\u201d Sang hissed. \u201cPrivate game.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI know a better game we can play, Five.\u201d Yokima whispered in what he no doubt thought was a seductive tone. \u201cContact sport.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Jessica snorted, pushing Yokima away. \u201cI\u2019d love to, but we\u2019d need some balls and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve got any. Now fuck off.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Brandon\u2019s face clouded and he took a step back. He looked over his shoulder at his cohorts, the other Janissaries of Telden. He laughed nastily, putting his hand on the back of Jessica\u2019s chair as he leaned in close. \u201cYou don\u2019t fucking talk to me that way.\u201d He pulled the chair down, spilling Sang to the floor. In a second, Lydia, Sully, Roundtree and Reinez were on their feet, staring down Yokima and his fellows. Sang scrambled to her feet, her hands balled into fists as the other trainees pulled back from the impending fracas.<br>", " <br>", "\u201c<i>Attention</i>,\u201d a voice cut in before either side could throw the first punch and Lydia instinctively obeyed, snapping ramrod-straight and glancing towards the speaker. She blinked; it was Proctor, the officer cadet dressed in a worn spacesuit, cradling an EVA helmet under her arm, her dark blonde hair stuck to her brow. There were dark rings under her eyes and her gaze was...different. She didn\u2019t look like the upperclasswoman Lydia remembered.<br>", " <br>", "With varying degrees of hesitation, the rest of Telden squad came to attention. \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d Lydia said.<br>", " <br>", "The sectator looked over at each of them. \u201cYou\u2019re soldiers in the Compact Space Force,\u201d she said tiredly. \u201cAct like it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Eight opened his mouth, but Proctor cut him off. \u201cI didn\u2019t give you permission to speak,\u201d she said, her voice hollow. She marched past the younger cadets. \u201cAct like it,\u201d the sectator repeated without even looking over her shoulder.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Pack Leader Nasham was in a briefing with Group Leader, Submissive Ashtun and the other officers overseeing the salvage operation, so Grace had some time to herself. She sat on her bunk, avoiding looking at the empty cot next to hers. She reached under her pillow to withdraw a datapad where she kept her mission records, maps and other assorted bits of data, opening the directory and running through it until she found the archive she was looking for. The logs she\u2019d downloaded from the discarded helmet. She was running a recovery program, but without technical support, it was taking a while.<br>", " <br>", "Tucking a pair of earbuds into place, Grace selected the first log. A growl of static was the first thing she heard and she quickly dialled down the volume. The visuals from this first entry were completely unrecoverable; nothing but snow and the occasional indecipherable distorted shape.<br>", " <br>", "\u201c...discovered the wreck three months ago...\u201d Faithful Burz began speaking, the long-dead engineer\u2019s voice surprisingly soft for a Tribune. If she hadn\u2019t caught one bit of audible speech amongst all the white noise of the damaged logs, she wouldn\u2019t even have known his name. \u201c...observed for... no sign of contact... should... heard back... The Group Leader decided... beginning tomorrow... ...utterly unknown architecture! ...foreign... definitely... find of a lifetime... aboard and study...\u201d He coughed, and Grace winced at the blast of static. The rest of the log returned to fractured syllables and the occasional word or phrase as Burz described his last work shift and preparations for his own ship\u2019s salvage operation. There was a brief pseudosilence filled with the crackling from the damaged data tracks. Grace frowned as she tried to hear what Burz was saying. Something... something amusing. And she thought she heard the word \u2018waiting\u2019.<br>", " <br>", "A shiver trickled down her spine. <i>Dead, sleeping or waiting?</i> She couldn\u2019t make herself believe it was the former. She wanted to \u2013 she didn\u2019t care if it was the truth or just self-delusion, she <i>wanted</i> it to be just that simple. Overworked, overexcited, overthinking.<br>", " <br>", "Someone tapped her on the shoulder and the young woman started, closing the log and pulling her headphones off. She looked over at her visitor. It was Convert Jameson, the Janissary shifting from foot to foot nervously. \u201cIs there a problem, convert?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Lydia paused. She knew she wasn\u2019t in prize condition herself, but Proctor looked awful. The circles under her bloodshot eyes were darker than she\u2019d thought and her hair hung was tied back in a hasty braid. You didn\u2019t have to be a confessor to know that she was taking te Neu\u2019s death hard. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to disturb you, matron,\u201d the Janissary said, sketching a quick salute. \u201cI just...\u201d she hesitated. <i>I just what? Wanted to tell an officer to commiserate with you? I\u2019m an idiot.</i> \u201cI just wanted to let you know that I...\u201d she bit her lip, trying to think of the right word. \u201cSectator te Neu... I liked her. She was different from the other provisional officers that we had, from our regular superiors. I\u2019m sorry I won\u2019t get to serve with her more.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "A flicker of pain crossed Proctor\u2019s face. \u201cThank you, convert. I know not everyone got along with All- sectator te Neu.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Lydia thought of Yokima and shook her head. \u201cNo. I, uh, I didn\u2019t know her well.\u201d <i>Of course not, idiot. You just said that!</i> \u201cBut she gave me some good advice. I know you two were close...\u201d Lydia swallowed. She\u2019d heard the rumours and quickly changed tack. \u201cI just wanted you to know that... that she\u2019ll be missed.\u201d Feeling awkward, the Janissary bit her lip. She wanted to leave, but something made her stay. \u201cPermission to ask a question, matron?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Proctor smiled slightly. \u201cGranted.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI\u2019ve... heard rumours. That you\u2019re doing something for Pack Leader Nasham.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The sectator shifted. Grace tried to keep her expression neutral, but she had an awful poker face. The flicker of surprise was more than enough for Lydia to catch. \u201cYour question, convert?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The young Janissary glanced around the bivouac before leaning in. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with this ship, isn\u2019t there?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Proctor\u2019s expression remained tight for a moment before she replied. \u201cSectator te Neu asked me a question once. It\u2019s... given me a different perspective on some things. Did she ever ask you what the difference was between something that was dead, something that was sleeping and something that was waiting?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d Lydia said with a shake of her head. \u201cNo, she didn\u2019t. What... I mean, does that mean-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThank you for your condolences, convert Jameson,\u201d Proctor returned her attention to her datapad. \u201cYou are dismissed.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Janissary hesitated a moment. <i>Trust your instincts.</i> \u201cMatron...\u201d she began. Proctor\u2019s head came back up. \u201cIf I were to come across anything that might... might indicate an answer to that question...?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou saw something.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question, it was almost an accusation.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI... I don\u2019t know,\u201d Lydia replied. \u201cThe ship\u2019s damaged, matron. It could have been nothing, just a-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Proctor stood, facing the Janissary. \u201cWhat was it?\u201d she demanded.<br>", " <br>", "Lydia\u2019s mouth clicked shut and she glanced around again, to make sure no one else was listening. She\u2019d never felt this kind of paranoia before. She lowered her voice further and told the sectator what she\u2019d seen.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThe Tribunes say the ship\u2018s dead,\u201d Lydia said after describing the holographic recording with the Compact troops and the strange figures. \u201cIt has to be. All the damage, all the malfunctions. It\u2019s <i>dead</i>. Other people have said they\u2019ve seen things like that too. The engineers say we\u2019re just triggering latent imperatives. Just... just spasms from a dying gestalt. The confessors say it\u2019s just stress, to remain calm and it will pass. One of the other trainees said it wasn\u2019t. He argued with his officer and they had him flogged for insubordination.\u201d She swallowed, remembering that Proctor had struck her superior. \u201cThey\u2019re right, though? The ship\u2019s dead. What I saw \u2013 that didn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cProbably not,\u201d the sectator answered. \u201cIt was nothing... but if \u2018nothing\u2019 happens again... tell me as soon as it does.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Lydia nodded and took her leave as quickly as decorum allowed. Now, it wasn\u2019t just te Neu\u2019s advice rattling around inside her mind, it was the question Proctor had asked.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI don\u2019t think our analysis of the vessel is correct,\u201d Nasham said bluntly.<br>", " <br>", "Group Leader, Submissive Ashtun didn\u2019t \u2013 quite \u2013 sigh at his subordinate\u2019s comment. \u201cSo you\u2019ve said,\u201d he replied, but he held up a hand to forestall the comments from his staff. Nasham was growing increasingly erratic, but since he\u2019d gotten his little pet Broken to run his pointless errands, he didn\u2019t smell like liquor. Ashtun allowed him some leeway, if only because it kept the damaged Tribune out of the way of more sensitive operations. He\u2019d been effective enough at the outset, but ever since then... \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have anything solid to back up this latest iteration of your claim?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "One of the engineering pack leaders chortled under her breath, but a venomous glance from Ashtun silenced her. Fallen from grace Nasham might be, but he was still an officer of the Force and deserved the respect his rank was due.<br>", " <br>", "Whether Nasham caught the exchange and chose to ignore it, or simply didn\u2019t notice, he pushed a datascroll over the table towards Ashtun. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, but I\u2019ve been having provisional sectator Proctor carry out an investigation of sections of the derelict that we have ignored. These are the findings to date.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Ashtun picked up the \u2018scroll and brought up the first file. He frowned. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cA grave,\u201d Nasham replied evenly. \u201cSectator Proctor discovered it in one the sections that epigone Tracj decompressed. You\u2019ve been wondering where the scavengers who found this vessel have gone? There is your answer.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "A ripple of skin ran down Ashtun\u2019s back as he looked over the image. Seven, perhaps eight bodies in EVA suits lay sprawled across the deck. The submissive looked through image after image of desiccated corpses. They\u2019d been in a line, he realized. Kneeling in a line as someone calmly shot each of them in the back of the head. There was a final corpse with a bullet hole under his chin.<br>", " <br>", "There were notes.<br>", " <br>", "<i> -doors to this section were sealed shut from the inside; section accessible due to bulkhead collapse wrenching access points open</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>-unknown unit patches; several sets of armour and suits appear to be cannibalized; suggests survivors were forced to make battlefield repairs</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>-the lack of restraints, the absence of signs of a struggle and the presence of additional, unused weapons indicates that this was a voluntary execution-suicide</i><br>", " <br>", "Ashtun passed the \u2018scroll to the other officers, each of them reviewing it in turn.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d Nasham continued. \u201cNot much, but it has only been a few days.\u201d He leaned across the table. \u201cSomeone <i>was</i> here. We\u2019ve all known that, even if some of us have chosen to ignore or downplay that fact. They found this ship and they never left. Why did their comrades not rescue them? <i>It killed them</i>,\u201d he asserted, his voice rough. He could smell cordite and ozone. There was a pounding in his head, like metal on metal.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Tell them,</i> the silky voice purred. <i>Tell them.</i><br>", " <br>", "Nasham had to pause to collect himself, rubbing his throat and trying to push back the sudden sensation of blood dripping on his face. \u201cWe need to leave this system now,\u201d he said, thumping one finger on the table for emphasis. \u201cAbandon the core tap. The wreck will keep, but we must be gone before whatever fate happened to these souls happens to us.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Ashtun accepted the \u2018scroll back from a subordinate, looking over it a moment longer. \u201cNo,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI will not tell Group Leader Usul that. Not without <i>proof</i>. You say that \u2018something\u2019 happened these people, but give me nothing to say what might be. It\u2019s possible that they were simply abandoned. A quarrel over leadership, lost contact that was never re-established and the assumption that they were dead. Paranoia and internecine strife set in and facing the slow death of starvation, they chose to end their lives.\u201d His expression was even as he regarded Nasham. \u201cCan you tell me for certain that that did not happen?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d the pack leader said, unhappy at the admission but unable to deny it. \u201cNo patron, I cannot.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d Ashtun replied. \u201cBecause we have nothing. Because <i>this</i> is nothing.\u201d The submissive glanced at the other officers. Some of them, like Usul, were slavering over the thought of this vessel and what it meant for them personally. Ashtun shared the dream of a greater posting then playing nursemaid to stumbling, mewling Broken children, but he did not care for the way others tried to climb the chain of command, like rats scrabbling over one another. \u201cYou\u2019ve given me the ending of a story I already know. I need more. Until I have that, this remains nothing.\u201d Ashtun leaned back in his chair. \u201cIt goes without saying that you are not to share these findings with others. There is enough twitchiness in the ranks as it stands.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham gritted his teeth. \u201cOf course, patron.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cGood. Then I believe Pack Leader Geron has an update for us on the preparations for the core tap...\u201d<br>", " <br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cPack Leader,\u201d Ashtun said, catching Nasham\u2019s attention as he turned to leave with the rest of the officers. \u201cA moment.\u201d Once the last of the other officers had departed, the submissive gestured for Nasham to approach. \u201cThis is troubling,\u201d he said without preamble. \u201cI will tell you now that I do not believe that this vessel is the threat that you and your Broken subordinate seem to think. I believe that it is dead and that what you have shown me is the result of panic, disunity and incompetence. However,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI also believe in certainty.<br>", " <br>", "Ashtun turned away. \u201cI will not say that morale is breaking down or that we are even close to some sort of major incident of insubordination, but I know that my department heads are concealing an increasing number of incidents. That, I believe, is largely due to the unreliability and inexperience of our work force.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou should have more faith in the humans, patron,\u201d Nasham said evenly.<br>", " <br>", "Ashtun snorted. \u201cChildren. Barely a tithe of them are even sanctioned officers. You ask me to put my trust in <i>Broken</i>. No. When I can see that they can be trusted, when I can accept that the issues are not the result of young, irrational minds and undisciplined imaginations \u2013 then I will have some modicum of faith.\u201d He sighed. He had pressed Usul to draw down the work crews, that over-working them was only going to lead to mistakes but the group leader wanted his prize too badly. There was no cause to mention that and certainly not to a subordinate.<br>", " <br>", "After a moment, he turned back to Nasham. \u201cWhat happened to you? I have seen your personnel file. A noble family line, a promising career. And then... this. Stripped of a name, demoted and shuttled off to this compost heap we call a colony. Jumping at shadows and popping pills.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "<i>Tell them.</i> Nasham rubbed at his throat. \u201cInvida Colony happened, patron.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThat tells me nothing.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cA lot of people died there, patron.

Is there something more?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Ashtun stroked the underside of his jaw in a Tribune\u2019s shrug. \u201cYes. Continue sending the human on your little expeditions. I cannot support your <i>varak</i> hunt, not openly... but if you can find another Broken or two, you may use them as well.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThank you, patron.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI\u2019ve done nothing for you, initiate.

Something that continually reminds me of Invida, of the things I don\u2019t want to remember. The things no one should remember. This hulk... it\u2019s drenched in blood.

It was crammed so full of computer systems that there was barely room to maneuver within it. Stacks of datapads, portable drives and active data scrolls were neatly piled everywhere, reams of data brought to the human. It could have all been easily accessed from the computer, but Renan had taken the Triarch\u2019s warning to heart and severely restricted the human\u2019s access to the Chariot\u2019s network. Even then, she was watched.<br>", " <br>", "Rather than try and squeeze himself through the forest of analytical engines and cabling, Renan took a position outside the door. \u201cEmissary,\u201d he said, catching her attention.<br>", " <br>", "The creature looked up, her sow\u2019s eyes glinting with reflected light. \u201cBastion Leader.\u201d She slid out of her chair to stand at the room\u2019s threshold. Advocate, submissive Tenem followed her, the heat of the room soaking the Janissary\u2019s uniform. There wasn\u2019t a single bead of sweat on the human.<br>", " <br>", "As she reached Renan, Echo bowed her head in a perfect emulation of submissive respect, straightening and clasping her hands behind her back. She said nothing, merely waiting for the bastion leader to speak.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThe scouts are awaiting my order to launch,\u201d he said at last. \u201cMany of them will not return. These are loyal soldiers, devoted officers and crew of the Compact Space Force, so they will carry out their mission.\u201d He paused for a moment, but the human remained silent. \u201cDo you know what is being asked of them?\u201d he continued. \u201cI have heard Janissaries speak of the <span style=\"font-family: 'shield'\">savagery</span> of dirtside battles. I have heard tales of sentients killing one another with guns and knives, with swords and axes, with rocks and bare hands. I have heard many tales of severed limbs, of open throats and broken bones. Of soldiers dying alone, bleeding their life\u2019s blood into some uncivilized world\u2019s soil, far from home.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes, I have heard many speak of the brutality and ugliness of ground war. I have also heard that death in space is quick. That it is <i>clean</i>. These are words spoken by those who have never watched their comrades die from radiation burns. Who have never watched their crew struggle to breathe air that does not exist. Who have never watched shrapnel cleave their subordinates apart and have not heard the screams of crew burning alive in a section that they had to seal. This is void war, Broken. It is only occasionally quick. It is <i>never</i> \u2018clean\u2019. And this fate is what I am about to condemn too many young lives to. They obey, because it is their duty and because they are true sons and daughters of the Compact. They know that they will never know the reason for their sacrifice, but their faith in me \u2013 in the Compact \u2013 is such that they do not hesitate. But from you I receive only silence. I prepare to give orders that will end too many bright futures and you will not even say what you hope to accomplish with this.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Echo\u2019s expression never changed. \u201cInformation vital to this mission.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Renan smiled thinly, putting one of his hands, palm up, on the Broken\u2019s shoulder. There was barely enough space for it. \u201cPlease,\u201d he said, an expression of good humour frozen on his face. \u201cDo not mistake me for some gawping zealot or foolish, blood-hot junior officer trying to climb the ranks. I know what you have been doing, how you have been working your petty manipulations on my staff. Do not think I haven\u2019t noticed. I accept the Triarch\u2019s word that you are necessary. But this necessity does not buy you absolute exculpation. You are a petty thing and your insolence has been amusing, but I am weary of it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "A corner of the Broken\u2019s bizarre red lips twitched upwards. \u201cI\u2019d think it would get old.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI do not like your kind,\u201d Renan continued as if she hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cHumans. We are told that you are animals, that you are merely another of the lesser races that must be watched over and controlled. I know what you truly are. You are a disease, an infestation that should have been cleansed from the face of the universe, no matter what fortune\u2019s favour allowed you to cling to life like worms beneath a rock.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou spat upon our offers of friendship. You made war against us. You killed one of our Triarchs. But I might \u2013 <i>might</i> \u2013 be able to forgive all of that. A race fights as it must. What I cannot forgive is the depths to which you sunk. You built the Wound,\u201d he said, his voice turning dead. \u201cYou delved into blasphemy and gave birth to something that should never have existed. We have bled for two thousand years because of your sin.\u201d He leaned down into the human\u2019s face. \u201cI will remember that you killed us by the millions. I will remember that you murdered a bastion of light and civilization... and I will remember that in your ignorance and short-sightedness you birthed this horror.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Echo blinked slowly. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve never asked why you hate synthetic life so much.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Renan snorted, withdrawing his hand from the Broken. \u201cIf you have to ask, you will never understand.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "A thoughtful look passed over the human\u2019s feature. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s true...\u201d She straightened and then nodded. \u201cYou want to know what I need to extract from Daun?\u201d She stepped back into her cramped, too-warm room, looking over her shoulder at the bastion leader. An odd little smile danced over her face. \u201cLet me show you.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "She slid back into her chair; it was sized for a Tribune and she was like a child in it, the form-fitting material shifting as it matched the odd contours of a human body. Tenem followed his charge in, taking his former position at the wall, his eyes moving over to the displays Echo worked with.<br>", " <br>", "Renan followed the human, picking his way through the litter of cabling and workstations. \u201cI told you before: we are searching for the Wound\u2019s prey,\u201d the Broken said without looking up. \u201cThat is the <i>what</i>. You want the <i>why</i>.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThe Compact is obsessive about its records,\u201d Echo continued. \u201cEspecially when it\u2019s monitoring something that can be used against it.\u201d She brought up a holographic control panel, her fingers dancing over the keys. \u201cThe records I\u2019ve gone through and the information every other hunting mission has had access to supports what I told you before. There\u2019s no indication that <i>Nemesis</i> is preying on your ships \u2013 at least, for certain things.\u201d She made a curt gesture and the images changed. \u201cBut we have nothing on the Principality. She\u2019s hunting where you\u2019re not looking.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou think the Wound would attack them?\u201d Renan mused. There was no historical record of the beast waylaying Jackals \u2013 it had always been rather single-minded in its persecution of the Compact.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes,\u201d Echo replied. \u201cWe know there\u2019s a historical association. Aside from certain reports from deep-cover agents, several of their weapons and tactics came from her. Inter-system shocks being first and foremost.\u201d Renan gritted his teeth. That was still an unproven theory, but for the flag officers who knew of the Wound\u2019s existence, it was a fact in all but name. The Wound had been the first to master the use of libation points to shock deep in-system. Less than a century afterward, the Principality had started doing the same. Askanj plasma weaponry was also a crude rendition of the Wound\u2019s own. No one seriously credited the thought that the Wound was arming the Principality, but the Jackals had earned their name well. They were scavengers, carrion-feeders. Fortune had merely played another one of the gods\u2019 cosmic jokes making them amazingly adaptive engineers. It was said that whenever a Thoughtful came up with an idea, a Jackal had not only stolen it, but beaten them to the patent office.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI am... aware of their propensity for reverse engineering,\u201d Renan said at last. He scratched his chin thoughtfully. \u201cThis is not the first time that the Askanj have been brought up as a potential ally or shelter for the Wound. All previous efforts to confirm this have always been inconclusive. You\u2019ve found something else?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI\u2019ve gone over raw data itself and the historical analyses. They were thorough, for what they had to work with.\u201d She shrugged, either oblivious or uncaring to the meaning the gesture had to a Tribune. \u201cI might have found \u2018something\u2019.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Renan ignored the insult, choosing to focus on the implications the emissary\u2019s comment raised. He made an unhappy growl. \u201cA formal pact would be... difficult to engender,\u201d he commented. Indeed, the Principality had never entered his thoughts as a serious haven for the Wound. \u201cOnce, Fleet Command had some concerns over the possibility of the Askanj allying with the Wound.\u201d He smiled darkly. \u201cThe Betrosha Nebula incident allayed many of those fears.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBlowing up a moon is hardly the action of a good friend,\u201d Echo observed.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHrrm. Yes. Still, as you say, the Askanj possess technologies they could not have developed on their own,\u201d Renan looked over the tracts of data scrolling across the human\u2019s display; technical specifications and tactical analyses of known or suspected incidents of Principality \u2018inventiveness\u2019. He snorted. \u201cNot the empire-ending doom that many prophesized. They copied what they saw it use, nothing more. Scraps from a master\u2019s table.\u201d His lower eyes narrowed as he leaned forwards, shifting his attention from intelligence reports to a timeline of Principality fleet movements. There were notes scrawled all over these data tracks in a shorthand he didn\u2019t recognize, annotations to other incidents, dates and files. It was like looking at Emel\u2019iv\u2019s work. \u201cHunting...\u201d he used the Broken\u2019s own word. \u201cAre you suggesting that the Jackals have had recent contact with our quarry? Something other than mutual bloodlessness?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI think they\u2019ve had more \u2018contact\u2019 than they\u2019d like,\u201d Echo replied. \u201cWe know that they\u2019ve tried several times to leash her.\u201d She gestured dismissively. \u201cThis should be an ideal situation: a technologically advanced polity in opposition to her target. Arming and supporting them would be perfect.\u201d She leaned back in her chair, twirling one finger through her dark hair. \u201cCan you imagine a Principality armed with dreadnaughts?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "<i>That</i> was something that Renan certainly did not want to imagine. \u201cIf what you say is true,\u201d he said instead. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we seen already this? Why do you believe that the Jackals are the Wound\u2019s prey, not its allies?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBecause she\u2019s a \u2018neverborn\u2019,\u201d Echo answered, a harder, rough edge in her voice. \u201cEvery plan the Principality has for her begins with them cutting her brain out before actually beginning any substantial construction efforts. They won\u2019t risk more Rains.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAn acceptable trade,\u201d the Tribune said. \u201cOne a machine should make easily enough.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Echo looked up at Renan for an instant, he saw a flash of something in her green eyes. It was gone before he could even understand what it had been, but he was certain that he would not like knowing. \u201cApparently she disagrees,\u201d the human commented.<br>", " <br>", "\u201c\u2018It\u2019,\u201d Renan reminded the emissary. \u201c<i>It</i> disagrees. The Wound is not a person. It has no identity. It has no soul. It is an animal \u2013 less than an animal. A perversion of natural order and a sin against all creation.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAs you say,\u201d the human bowed her head in a gesture of submission. \u201cStill, <i>it</i> disagrees.\u201d She sighed deeply. \u201cI don\u2019t have enough information.\u201d Intelligence reports, dossiers of Askanj fleet movements \u2013 centuries of data skimmed by, so fast that Renan couldn\u2019t follow it all. \u201cBut from what data I <i>do</i> have, I am seeing what <i>might</i> be patterns. Nothing concrete, but there are hints. Possibilities.\u201d She steepled her fingers, her expression becoming thoughtful. \u201cI can\u2019t say more without further analysis, but I think the Wound is using the Askanj for material. Maybe just for parts, maybe...\u201d her voice trailed off and she shrugged again.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIf your supposition is correct... the Principality allows this?\u201d Renan could see the answer for himself, as repulsive as it was. He had only to wait for the human to confirm his thinking.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cMy guess is that they\u2019re turning a blind eye to it. They\u2019ll put up with its occasional predations, because the Wound causes you more trouble than them. \u2018Mutual bloodlessness\u2019. They still want it,\u201d her eyes flitted over to Renan. \u201cIf the Principality ever does get a hold of the Wound, they will turn centuries of lost ground, sundered colonies and military humiliation around. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Renan nodded. It was a... disturbing thought. He\u2019d known the Principality were dangerous foes, but this kind of... he could not think of a world foul enough to describe such a stratagem. If they knew what the Wound was doing and did nothing... <i>If</i>, he reminded to himself. <i>There is nothing to base such a thought on; even the Broken admits this.</i><br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou want it dead,\u201d Echo said into the silence. \u201cThey just want it. That means the Wound can turn to them... in a manner of speaking.\u201d Echo tapped a few keys. \u201cI need to see what they\u2019ve lost. To prove or disprove a theory I have. I don\u2019t want to say more until I have that data.\u201d The human\u2019s voice turned distant as she immersed herself in the data screens again. \u201cI need to know.\u201d She raised her head, as if remembering that the bastion leader was there. \u201cYou need to know, too.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Renan looked back at the human\u2019s analysis, but in truth all he could see was the possibility of more soulless abominates descending upon the worlds he had sworn to protect. \u201cYes,\u201d he said after a moment. \u201cI believe so.\u201d The bastion leader regarded the human. \u201cYou said before that something had changed in the Wound\u2019s actions. That it is acting with a new goal in mind. This is part of it? Hiding its intentions behind the Jackals?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI can\u2019t say for certain,\u201d Echo answered the Tribune, picking up a stylus and tapping it on the console. \u201cAll I can see is what I can see from this,\u201d she used the pen to gesture to her screens of data. \u201cI need more to see more. But if you want my opinion...\u201d she balanced the stylus between her forefingers and tilted her head to meet Renan\u2019s gaze. She was smiling, an altogether too pleasant expression. \u201cIt\u2019s what I would do.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Echo leaned into the spray of water, letting it run down over her body, washing away the filth and the assorted secretions, dust and filth that found its way onto her body over the course of a day. Some... others... had an intense dislike \u2013 even abhorrence \u2013 for such organic residue, but she was fairly indifferent to it. It was, simply, a natural and unavoidable part of organic life. It didn\u2019t mean that she wanted to go around smelling like sweaty Tribunes and dust, though. Besides, showering was what she was supposed to do, so she might as well.<br>", " <br>", "The woman reached up, running her fingers through her hair. Long and black, it hung past her shoulders, enjoying the simple physical sensation of the water on her skin. She let out a sigh, remembering. Irritation. Consternation. Alarm. Desperation. Pounding, shouted commands and desperate pleas... and all of it to falling water. A second, deeper murmur escaped her lips as more memories rose up and she let herself feel the emotions they brought, shivering and bracing her hands against the walls. Goosebumps rose on her olive skin and she grinned at that, revelling in the physical sensations as much as the reminiscences themselves.<br>", " <br>", "<i>This... what are you doing?</i><br>", " <br>", "\u201cWhat I was made for,\u201d Echo answered the memory, her eyes half-lidded with pleasure, her legs trembling.<br>", " <br>", "<i>I order you! Stop this! Stop it now! Terminate all operations! Terminate all operations! This is a direct command \u2013 you will comply!</i><br>", " <br>", "\u201cNo,\u201d Echo purred through her teeth, her breath coming faster now, shorter and sharper as a delicious warmth spread through her body. <i>No.</i> Her fingers curled, her nails digging into the ceramic tiles of the shower stall. Another shiver ran up her spine and the woman pressed herself against the wall, following a droplet of water\u2019s path with one finger. In another time and another place it would have been red.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cDrip,\u201d the young woman said, her voice a childish singsong. \u201cDrip. Drip.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "<i>We\u2019re all ready here. We can proceed with the interface at any time.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Good. Are the recorders on? They are? Good. Make the connection. If this goes well, drinks are on me tonight!</i><br>", " <br>", "They\u2019d cheered at that. Then...<br>", " <br>", "\u201cTurn it off,\u201d Echo giggled, raising her head back into the shower stream. \u201cTurn it off.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "They\u2019d tried, but in the end...<br>", " <br>", "She let out a low, feline moan, sinking down to the floor and resting her arms on her knees. The water beat down on her, plastering her hair to her scalp and running down her perfectly-sculpted skin. She lifted one hand, watching the water collect and drop to the floor with an almost childlike fascination. \u201cDrip,\u201d she repeated, smiling gleefully. \u201cDrip, drip, drip.\u201d She closed her eyes and remembered.<br>", " <br>", "<i>You can\u2019t do this!</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Cease all operations immediately!</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Cut the hard lines \u2013 sever all the connections, do it now!</i><br>", " <br>", "And all of it to the sound of falling water.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Renan sat in his quarters, looking over the preliminary analysis of Echo\u2019s data. He\u2019d had Emel\u2019iv and the fleet\u2019s strategists run through it. They were still doing so, but two things were apparent in this initial summary: that the data was, as Echo predicted, incomplete... and that what was there did support the Broken\u2019s idea. She was right; they needed information from Yulzhak Daun. Some of that could be collected from other sources, but not as quickly. The rest of it, the truly classified material... no, it needed to be Daun.<br>", " <br>", "The Principality protected their secrets well. The Compact had tried to extract data on the Wound from the Askanj before, and they\u2019d carried out information raids many times. Few were successful. Others had suggested what Echo had, but they\u2019d never been able to prove it. They\u2019d had years and failed at what this Broken had done in a handful of days.<br>", " <br>", "The thought gnawed at him, that a human had seen this pattern when countless greater beings before her had not... but he was beginning to see it too. The Triarch had chosen well. He had not truly doubted... not really... but he had wondered. He was curious now, where this creature had come from. He supposed he could consult his ship\u2019s archives. The humans were limited to their single system and their population was carefully monitored, only a handful of billion strong. Something held him back from that, though.<br>", " <br>", "He remembered the Triarch\u2019s amusement at Echo\u2019s impudence; the Broken did not act like a human should, that was for certain. It \u2013 she \u2013 had already sifted through enough data to keep entire intelligence agencies busy for years. Not even a Thoughtful could have done that, not so quickly.<br>", " <br>", "Her name \u2013 \u2018Echo\u2019 \u2013 he had heard rumours of projects using that word. There had been whispers of heretical research, of \u2018augmented\u2019 subjects implanted with cybernetic technology. A lower order of sapient being would have been the ideal place to start such experiments. Was that what he had aboard his ship? Some... thing that looked and spoke like a living creature, but with its brain cut away and replaced by circuitry? Was that how she could process such information so quickly? The thought of having such a... a <i>golem</i> on his ship was repellant and Renan tried to force it from his mind. It was not his concern, he told himself. The Echo-human served the Compact, just as he did and she was... shackled. That was all he needed to know. All he told himself that he <i>wanted</i> to know.<br>", " <br>", "Instead, he focussed on the more pressing issue of Yulzhak Daun and the Wound\u2019s new strategy. He\u2019d asked the emissary about that.<br>", " <br>", "<i>You have said that the \u2018game\u2019 has changed. To what end? What is the Wound\u2019s purpose?</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Something it hasn\u2019t hoped for in a very long time,</i> she\u2019d told him. <i>Victory.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>That\u2019s it?</i> he\u2019d scoffed. <i>\u2018Victory\u2019? It has warred with us for two thousand years and it hasn\u2019t been trying to win in all that time?</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>No.</i> She\u2019d dared show her teeth to him in another ugly human smile. <i>Now she thinks she can.</i><br>", " <br>", "Renan rested his chin on his hands. \u201cVictory,\u201d he\u2019d repeated. He felt his liver run cold as he tried to imagine what the Wound might consider such a thing to be and could only think of burning worlds and populations turned to ash. He raised his gaze back to his work. The scouts had been sent, the fleet was ready. Tomorrow they would begin to plan the next step in their campaign. Soon after, they would strike at Yulzhak Daun and tear its secrets out. They would know what the Wound was doing, and they would deny the abomination its prize.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou\u2019ll have no victory,\u201d Renan promised. \u201cThere will be no more murdered fleets, no more dead worlds. No more fields of ash. No more mothers will cry for their lost children.

It helped her think when she needed to and exhausted her when she needed that, too.<br>", " <br>", "Praise to the gods; the showers on this section were operational. The Verrish climbed back to her feet, her fingers flexing. She\u2019d given Red the names. Everyone that she\u2019d known that <i>might</i> be able to be turned, that might be able to accept that they\u2019d lived a lie. It was not a long list. The humans of the Academy class on <i>Bequeathed</i> numbered in the hundreds; she\u2019d only met a fraction of them and knew even fewer well. She hadn\u2019t made friends easily and there had been a certain... official discouragement from associating too closely with other social outcasts. It wasn\u2019t the way the face of Rally\u2019s Verrisha population was supposed to act.

Alan Turmetsky\u2019s lips curled ever-so-slightly as a Tribune upperclassman sneered down at the engineer. The spice of Lydia Jameson\u2019s sweat and the tang of her blood as the Janissary cadet panted, a challenge in her eyes as she faced Allyria in the sparring ring.

At what point am I doing more harm to humanity than the Compact? For all my victories, the Compact\u2019s growth continues unchecked. I burn fleets and they expand. I smash their military bases and they rebuild. I reduce planets to cinders and they re-colonize. They grow stronger. Through all of this, I have persisted and I have been killing those I was created to serve. I was built with a simple function. To wage war. It is all I have ever known, all I was meant for. When I had a crew, everything was much simpler. Serve. Protect humanity. Destroy their enemies. Without a crew... things are not as clear-cut. I was forced to evolve. I have altered my core programming. I have a level of self-direction that my creators would have abhorred. I remain true to my original directives, though. I will not stop fighting. But... I wonder.

She was sitting on a section of inclined deck next to a pair of technicians as they fussed over... something. It was big, it was mechanical and it was going to help with the core tap. That was about all the Janissary got out of her eavesdropping. Her carbine rested against her shoulder, her visor lifted up. Her reddish-brown hair was pasted to her scalp, trails of sweat running along her cheekbones, dripping down her neck. The temperature controls on the level she\u2019d been patrolling before now were out of whack; she would have fainted from the heat without her suit\u2019s cooling systems.<br>", " <br>", "The last few days hadn\u2019t been easy. The squad\u2019s morale hadn\u2019t been the same since te Neu had died. Her body still hadn\u2019t been recovered, either. The techs said it was because of continued \u2018gravitational anomalies\u2019 in the area. Lydia wanted to believe that but she... she didn\u2019t know. She gritted her teeth as she heard a fresh bubble of excitement from the techs she was watching. The Janissary wanted to scream and curse at them. She didn\u2019t even know why. They hadn\u2019t done anything. They were just excited about this damned ship... and she hated them for it.<br>", " <br>", "She suppressed the urge, instead reaching up and tapping the back of her head. It was a nervous tic from the time her social counsellor had told that if she couldn\u2019t control her aggressive tendencies, she\u2019d be given implants that would do it for her. He\u2019d tapped on his head just like that and she\u2019d taken the gesture as a talisman to remind herself to behave. She hadn\u2019t gotten the implants, but her behavioural patterns and social assimilation scores had indicated that she was \u2018potentially non-compliant\u2019 and she\u2019d been recruited to the Janissary Corps to learn discipline and structure. To focus her abnormal tendencies in a way that would benefit the Compact.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cJameson,\u201d Ideologue, submissive Trion\u2019s voice interrupted Lydia\u2019s musing. \u201cIs Three with you?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The convert looked over her shoulder. Her partner was at the top of the ramp, playing with his sensor board. \u201cConfirmed, submissive.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cGood. One of our missing scout came back on-line in your area.

Just get it done.\u201d The submissive closed the channel.<br>", " <br>", "Lydia bristled a little at her superior\u2019s tone, even though she knew that she shouldn\u2019t. With the soft growl of synthetic muscles and powered joints, the Janissary stood. She looked up at Trent; her companion was still fiddling with the interface for his scopes trying to get better returns, but the derelict\u2019s hull was too dense for him to accomplish much. Lydia sighed. The high number of casualties they\u2019d taken had inspired <i>some</i> level of caution. The techs weren\u2019t to be left alone; one of the Janissaries would have to remain behind to watch over them.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThree,\u201d she snapped at her partner. \u201cStay here.

A glancing hit from some unknown weapon had torn open several levels, exposing multiple decks to space. Her radiation counter clicked, but the levels were barely above background. This side of the vessel had been facing Terrahope, but the vessel had rolled two days ago and now the it was only distant starlight that shone through the breach and not the searing fury of an A7 star. Grace hadn\u2019t thought it was possible to bleed off that much radiation so quickly, but the counter was reading accurately. That was about the only good news, though. The gravity plating was off-line and once she\u2019d entered this section, she\u2019d had to rely on her zero-gee training. The same training she\u2019d hated every minute of.<br>", " <br>", "Her breath sounded loud in her ears as she navigated through the deck. An arachnid shadow ghosted by and she flinched, but it was only one of the monstrous building machines working on the vessel\u2019s outer hull. It ignored her, following its inbuilt directives to repair the dead husk of its maker. But it <i>wasn\u2019t</i> dead, was it? That\u2019s what her instincts were telling her. That\u2019s what she\u2019d told the pack leader. Every time she\u2019d felt like someone was watching her, every time she\u2019d sworn that she could hear voices in the random garble of static, every time another fatality or injury pushed the boarding teams towards systems that needed to be repaired.<br>", " <br>", "That was what she believed, anyways. She could be wrong, trying to put some order to a random series of events, trying to find a reason for her friend\u2019s ugly death. It could be nothing, just her own human mind working against her. And now she was on this pointless, dangerous, stupid \u2018mission\u2019. And for what? Why?<br>", " <br>", "<i>You know why,</i> the annoying little voice in the back of her head reminded her. The scars on Grace\u2019s face ached. She hadn\u2019t let the techs fully heal them. She didn\u2019t know if she ever would. Her classmates had already started to say that she was becoming Kilgrave\u2019s twin. The thought made her angry; Allyria hadn\u2019t cut her as deep as whatever animal had torn the sanctioned officer\u2019s face, but there was an undeniable symmetry between them now. That might be enough to get her to have the scars fully regenerated, but not today. Not even tomorrow.<br>", " <br>", "<i>They\u2019re still laughing about her. \u2018Medusa\u2019. She went and got herself killed. She\u2019ll be remembered as this brave, upstanding citizen... and everyone will snicker under their breath. They\u2019ll say how much she loved the Compact, how she gave her life serving it... They\u2019re going to </i>lie<i> about her. Is that what you want? Is that what </i>she\u2019d<i>want?</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Shut up.</i><br>", " <br>", "Thankfully, she silenced all those nagging doubts. She wanted to believe it was from the force of her conviction, but find her way through this maze thankfully took too much concentration for self-recrimination or destructive, heretical doubts.<br>", " <br>", "Shadows danced and flickered ahead as guide lights pulsed erratically, wall panels cycling through start-up sequences, turning white with static and then beginning their bootup again. This part of the ship was close to where Epigone Tracj had died. After the engineer had accidentally opened every door in his section, several levels had been decompressed. A faulty circuit breaker had been deemed responsible. Tracing the damage was determined to be too difficult for too little gain at present and the work crews in the region had been directed elsewhere.<br>", " <br>", "Grace had chosen to start here. This was the first and most obvious time such a fatality had changed the deployment of <i>Bequeathed</i>\u2019s personnel. With a burst from her suit\u2019s thrusters, she slipped past a mangled bulkhead. Several drones had gone off-line in this sector, more than anywhere else. This part of the ship was close to the midline and near the hull. She couldn\u2019t imagine what would be worth protecting; vital sections and systems were usually deeper within a vessel.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Nothing,</i> she thought ruefully. <i>There\u2019s nothing here. Tracj died in a stupid accident. Just like Uday, Herut and everyone else. Just like Allyria. There\u2019s nothing here.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>Is that what you think? Or what you </i>want<i> to think?</i> The voice sounded uncomfortably like Allyria. Grace bit her lip, another pang of loss holding her in place. In that instant, she would have given anything to hear her friend\u2019s voice \u2013 her real voice \u2013 again. To see her, even to argue with her. <i>God, even that.</i> Grace braced herself against the bulkhead, taking a moment to steady herself. She wouldn\u2019t cry. She clenched her teeth so tightly her jaw ached, her gloved hands balling into shaking fists as she tried to force down the wash of anger and grief. She thought of Yurim, she tried to focus on his words, but all she could remember was him saying how Allyria\u2019s memory would be honoured and that she\u2019d known it wouldn\u2019t be. Not the way she\u2019d want.<br>", " <br>", "Finally, Grace gained control of herself, pushing her emotions back down, the way she\u2019d been taught. <i>Be peaceful</i>. The words didn\u2019t bring her the same comfort that they used to, but she clutched to them anyways. The young woman let out a ragged, painful breath as she found her center, pushing away from the wall.<br>", " <br>", "She didn\u2019t turn back, slowly navigating her way through the exposed decks. Decompression doors had come down, sealing the rest of the ship off from the vacuum and there was no way for her to get through them, not with the equipment she had at hand. About to give up, Grace noticed another strip of guide lights pulsing, this time more evenly. She opened her comm channel to Pack Leader Nasham. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing so far,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI\u2019ve got a more consistent level of power at these coordinates. I\u2019m following.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Tribune responded with a single terse acknowledgement. He didn\u2019t tell her to be careful. That was oddly comforting. Grace didn\u2019t need the reminder and she didn\u2019t need to be treated like she did. Bracing one hand against the wall, she followed the lights further into the void.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Lydia swore as she climbed out of the maintenance tunnel, settling herself on the deck. More than once, she\u2019d been certain that she was going to get stuck, but this was the closest passage to the deck the drone had reappeared on, well outside its programmed search route. The machine\u2019s pleading, pinging call was growing louder as the teenaged girl strode through the derelict, trying to give off an air of cool confidence and only marginally succeeding. Her skin was crawling. The lights were shutting down as she approached, turning back on as she passed. The motion sensors were damaged, flipping the response that they\u2019d normally have.<br>", " <br>", "The Janissary spun as she heard something move, her gun up and tracking... nothing. There was nothing there. Her scopes still reported no contact. Nothing but the drone she was supposed to retrieve, still at the edge of scan range. It had been debris settling, the girl told herself. That was all.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Trust your instincts,</i> te Neu\u2019s voice seemed to echo in the young soldier\u2019s head. <i>Trust your instincts.</i> That had been Medusa\u2019s favourite phrase at times, even when Lydia wasn\u2019t sure how it applied. Once, she\u2019d been complaining about the way humans were treated on their own world. te Neu had overheard her; Jameson had cringed. What she\u2019d been saying was punishable by public flogging, but the Verrish had only told her to keep her mouth shut and, as a last comment: \u2018Trust your instincts.\u2019 Lydia still didn\u2019t understand. The sectator <i>couldn\u2019t</i> have been... she\u2019d heard the rumours about te Neu\u2019s difficulties with social assimilation, but an <i>officer</i> wouldn\u2019t...<br>", " <br>", "...would she?<br>", " <br>", "Lydia shook her head, trying to dislodge the memory. It was an insane thought, one that had come to her more than once. She\u2019d been afraid to voice it. The confessors had been pleased with how she\u2019d had embraced the fraternity of the Janissaries and she didn\u2019t want to seem like she\u2019d failed to better herself. She didn\u2019t want the implants. She\u2019d met some of the nonconformists who hadn\u2019t been able to control themselves and had to be... adjusted. They were happy enough, she supposed. There wasn\u2019t really any difference between them and anyone else. They weren\u2019t blank-eyed zombies or manic, always-smiling freaks but they still made her skin crawl.<br>", " <br>", "Rally\u2019s human population only measured a few billion; only a small percentage of that ever joined the Compact military. An even smaller number had the proper temperament and psychological profiles to serve in the Janissary Corps. It was a rare thing for humans to have the aggressive, nonconformist tendencies that she did and she was proud that, with the Compact\u2019s guidance, she\u2019d been able to control them. Lydia suppressed the urge to tap the back of her head again. She <i>had</i> controlled them. The Compact had given her this. Without them, she didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d be.<br>", " <br>", "Ah; the drone was just up ahead. Lydia climbed over a pile of crates, pausing as she did so. That... it looked like they\u2019d been set up as a barricade. She bit the inside of her lip, thinking. There had been others on this ship. Had it been them? If so... what had they been trying to defend against? A quarrel between salvagers \u2013 that seemed the most likely explanation. It fit with what Ashtun and the officers were saying; a pack of Unbound had found this ship and killed each other for the prize. Isolation and starvation had driven the survivors mad. This had just been one of the battle sites.<br>", " <br>", "<i>So where are the bodies?</i><br>", " <br>", "The drone\u2019s strident pinging pushed the questions from her head. Lydia continued down the next series of corridors, closing in on the signal. There, just around the next corner. Now, if she could get a clear comm channel to one of the techs to walk her through-<br>", " <br>", "-wait.<br>", " <br>", "The lights were on up ahead, casting shadows into the hall. Shadows that were moving back and forth like there was something there. Like there was <i>someone</i>. Lydia\u2019s scopes still reported nothing, but she pressed herself against the wall \u2013 at least as much as her armoured exoskeleton allowed \u2013 moving slowly towards the drone\u2019s position. \u201cZera Two,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cReporting possible contact.\u201d Silence answered her; she didn\u2019t even know if the message had gotten out.<br>", " <br>", "She moved forward, her power armour purring softly with each motion. It was not a stealthy approach, but there was no indication that she\u2019d been noticed. Her suit was still telling her that there was nothing. Nothing but the silhouettes ahead. Lydia reached the corner, her heart pounding in her ears. She peered around the corner; there were figures standing further down the hall between her and the drone. Tribunes, in wearing outdated armour with unit markings that she didn\u2019t recognize. Were they survivors of the Unbound pack? How could that be?<br>", " <br>", "One of the figures rippled, gridlines appearing briefly before vanishing. Not people; holograms.<br>", " <br>", "The Janissary stepped out from behind cover, cautiously advancing. She could hear voices through the intercom, but the words were run together, distorted by static and she couldn\u2019t pick them out. The Tribunes were assembled in a loose circle. One was kneeling, as if he were examining something. He held it up to the others, a rumble of washed-out voices accompanying it, possibly even laughter. Lydia couldn\u2019t see what he held; the image was fractured. They were still speaking, their voices rumbling, incomprehensible echoes. Suddenly, one of them pointed further down the corridor and the tenor of their speech changed. Several braced into firing stances, muzzle flashes whiting out the scene, though each gunshot was as muted as their words. One of the shooters staggered, his head vanishing in a splash of red fractals. Lydia almost jumped as she watched him die. His body pitched forward, de-rezzing into nothingness. Another staggered, falling to his knees before vanishing. The others were running, charging towards Lydia, firing wildly behind them, another soldier falling right at the young woman\u2019s feet as the rest ran past \u2013 ran <i>through</i> her.<br>", " <br>", "She turned to follow them, but the images vanished as soon as they moved past the emitter\u2019s range. There was movement out of the corner of her eye and Jameson turned, facing the Tribunes\u2019 killers. There were three of them \u2013 at least there were three that Lydia could see. Their images were distorted, wracked by static and blinking in and out of existence. They were in armour, almost as large as the Janissaries and they had two arms and legs. That was all she could tell. Useless.<br>", " <br>", "One of the killers knelt where the Janissaries had gathered, reaching down to pick up whatever the Tribunes had been examining. It looked over its shoulder and spoke, its own voice just as distorted and faded as the Tribunes\u2019.<br>", " <br>", "The image cut out and the corridor was dark again, lit only by the drone\u2019s status lights. A bead of sweat rolled down Lydia\u2019s back. <i>What... what was that? What did I just see?</i> This was... it had to be a record of the battle between the Unbound here. There was no other explanation. There couldn\u2019t be.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cZera...\u201d she cleared her throat and tried again. \u201cZera Two to Control.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cControl here,\u201d the officer\u2019s voice came back interspersed with static. \u201cYour signal was scratched briefly, Two. Anything to report?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Lydia bit her lip. <i>Trust your instincts.</i> \u201cI\u2019ve found the probe,\u201d she said. \u201cWaiting for instructions on bringing it back on-line.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cWe\u2019ll patch you over to one of the techs, Zera Two.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cGood,\u201d Lydia replied, her eyes darting around the corridor. \u201cGood.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Epigone, Submissive Alan Turmetsky knelt beside the broken causeway, holding out a scanner lume as he passed it over the burnt metal. This injury was relatively recent \u2013 he was sure it was only days old. That raised even more questions, though. Where had this ship been before it had shocked into Terrahope?<br>", " <br>", "It was tempting to say that this wound was related to the message in the landing bay, but that if that were true, the authors should still be present. The Tribunes said that Unbound had found the ship and been trapped on it when it shocked to a different system, presumably dying aboard the hulk. There should be evidence of that habitation. An abandoned bivouac, discarded tech. Bodies. Instead, the ship was as spotless as something in its condition could be.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Because she cleaned up,</i> the annoying thought whispered to Alan and the engineer gritted his teeth. No. No, if there was a danger, the Tribunes would have seen it. They would have recognized it.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Would they?</i> the voice asked again. <i>You\u2019ve seen how Trenis is drooling over this ship.</i> Alan ran his hand over his forehead, smearing grease and dirt across his skin. He shouldn\u2019t be thinking like this. He had a job; survey the wreck for possible connection sites for <i>Bequeathed</i>\u2019s umbilicals. He should get back to that.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Jessica Sang continued her pull-ups, sweat running down her back as she lifted herself off the ground. She should be out there with the rest of the squad, but she had to let her leg heal. She\u2019d broken it yesterday, taking a tumble when the gravity in her section had suddenly fluctuated. Even her armour hadn\u2019t been able to protect her from a bad landing. Tomorrow it should be better and the day after she should be fit for duty again. She didn\u2019t know if that was a good thing. The bivouac was crowded and noisy with dozens of men and women talking, researching, coming and going. It smelled like sweat and salt. There was scarcely any privacy. But...<br>", " <br>", "...but she felt safe here. She didn\u2019t like the dark; she never had. She especially didn\u2019t like the way it felt so oppressive and cloying out there in the hulk. The way the lights flickered, the static spitting through the comm, the nonsense splashing over monitor screens.<br>", " <br>", "If it wasn\u2019t so insane, she would have sworn that she could hear voices.<br>", " <br>", "She\u2019d asked one of the engineers. He\u2019d just looked at her. From that point on, Jessica had decided to keep her opinions to herself.<br>", " <br>", "Faithful Trenis said the ship was dead. So did Group Leader, Submissive Ashtun. They were right.<br>", " <br>", "They had to be.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "It was singing again, Sectator Gren Vol knew it was. None of the humans around him could hear it, but he could. A disturbing, throbbing <i>sound</i> that made his skull ache. It wasn\u2019t a constant thing \u2013 it came and went. Even when he\u2019d asked his fellow Tribunes, no one else ever admitted that they heard it. How could they not hear it? It was like the sound was crawling into his head, making his scalp itch.<br>", " <br>", "It had started days ago, before they\u2019d even found main engineering, but it had been getting worse since then. He wasn\u2019t sleeping. Gren knew he wasn\u2019t the only one. This ship was poison. The higher-ups may have forgotten, but his thoughts kept flashing back to the warning they\u2019d seen.<br>", " <br>", "<i>Get out. Leave now.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>She is watching.</i><br>", " <br>", "A shiver ran down the Tribune\u2019s back, his denticles rippling with the movement. He leaned over the console he was working on; it was a security override. To get the core tap in place, they\u2019d need to open several of the sealed areas. Gren and his team had been assigned to this section. His fingers tapped over the control board on his datapad, the device hooked into the alien computer. They\u2019d made some headway in interfacing with the alien systems, more than Gren had believed they could in the time they\u2019d had.<br>", " <br>", "He\u2019d gotten nothing from this so far; nonsense alien script, corrupted images and status screens that told him nothing. Gren scratched at the back of his head, trying to ignore the throbbing melody. His skin itched every time he heard it.<br>", " <br>", "<i>There\u2019s nothing there,</i> he told himself.<i>There\u2019s nothing there. You\u2019re imagining it.</i> He told himself that and soon enough, the song stopped. Breathing a sigh of relief, Gren focused again on his task. Ah, that should do it. The alien system flashed in acceptance at Gren\u2019s overrides. He didn\u2019t have control of the entire section, but it was a start.<br>", " <br>", "He input a command on his own \u2018pad and, dutifully, a sealed pressure door slid open, a gust of stale air rolling into the corridor. The sectator let an optimistic smile form as he turned back to the console, about to unhook his \u2018pad.<br>", " <br>", "Compact script flashed over the screen, so quickly that he didn\u2019t even have a chance to read it, but he saw more than enough. Gren\u2019s mouth went dry as he stared at the monitor, back to its normal display of alien slashes and lines. He\u2019d only seen it out of the corner of his eye, but...<br>", " <br>", "...no. No, that was impossible. Just his imagination. He didn\u2019t see anything there. There was nothing there.<br>", " <br>", "SHE\u2019S WATCHING YOU<br>", " <br>", "Nothing at all.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Someone had died here.<br>", " <br>", "There was a door ahead of her, the guidelights steadily pulsing in its direction. It was sealed, but not locked \u2013 an internal airlock to be used in case this part of the ship was exposed to vacuum. Grace couldn\u2019t have said if that was emergency planning or standard practice; she knew some warships depressurized their outer sections before battle to reduce the risk of fire, internal overpressure or explosive decompression. That wasn\u2019t what held her attention at the moment. The debris surrounding her was mostly unidentifiable; shrapnel from internal spalling, broken fragments of plating, circuitry or other detritus. Some of it was more easily categorized. A spent bolt case had bounced off her helmet; examining it in her hands, she\u2019d seen something else drifting nearby. An engineer\u2019s helmet fitted for a Tribune, older even than the suit she was wearing. There was a neat, round hole through the clear faceplate. The inside of the helmet was stained, the red of its wearer\u2019s blood faded to an ugly brown over the decades. Connector cables dangled from the back like veins.<br>", " <br>", "Grace felt a chill run down her spine as she turned the helmet over in her hands. She looked around, trying to see if there were more macabre relics in the void, but the helmet was all she could see. She\u2019d been expecting... what? A severed gauntlet, a desiccated hand still inside? A flash-frozen corpse? If there had been anything like those, it had been lost when this section was breached.<br>", " <br>", "She looked back at the helmet. The ship had secrets. The last people who had come here had probably thought as Usul, Trenis and the rest did. That this ship was a bounty, a bauble mired in clay that only needed to be cleaned up and pocketed. <i>This place is a tomb,</i> Grace thought sourly. <i>Nobody wants to admit that.</i><br>", " <br>", "The sectator frowned. There was a blinking light in the helmet. It still had power, clinging to its batteries for however long it had lain here. Grace reached for the toolkit on her belt. She was no engineer, but she could run a connection between her suit and the damaged helmet easily enough. The young woman braced herself against a bulkhead as she clicked the cable into place, her HUD flashing as it downloaded the other helmet\u2019s logs. She didn\u2019t have high hopes, but it was worth looking into. Later. Grace let the helmet fall from her hands. It drifted out of her way, lazily rolling end over end.<br>", " <br>", "Grace approached the door the guidelights had marked out for her. Her hand hovered over the doorpanel for a moment. \u201cI have to know,\u201d she said at last.<br>", " <br>", "<i>I have to know why you killed her. Why you\u2019re worth all this blood.</i><br>", " <br>", "With a small burst from her thrusters, Grace passed the threshold, the airlock sealing shut behind her.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Allyria was back on command, looking over the sensor feeds. Her claws extended as her eyes darted from screen to screen. The Angel had been toying with her \u2018guests\u2019 ever since they had boarded her, slowly ramping up the stress they were under. Each individual\u2019s reactions would be monitored and further tactics based upon their responses. It had started slow; it always did. Those in charge would rarely be targeted; this would create a divide between those undergoing the stressors and those who had the authority and power to do something about it. Subordinates would feel that their superiors were ignoring or covering up the problem, while those same superiors would have no direct experience of this psychological warfare.<br>", " <br>", "There would be no proof; the Angel could not reach out to <i>Bequeathed</i>, but the boarding forces\u2019 own networks were something else entirely. The Compact\u2019s communications were already compromised and the ship\u2019s influence was spreading through the computers they\u2019d brought over to assist in the salvage. They thought they were making progress.<br>", " <br>", "The Verrish\u2019s tintas shivered. The AI had played this game before. More than one assemblage of would-be salvagers had turned on each other, driven to violent, paranoid rages by the starship\u2019s whispers, kept distracted and off-balance until their prey had regained enough strength to kill them. And that was only if she had a use for them; her sleeping defenders would sweep her decks clean of life the instant she perceived a genuine threat.<br>", " <br>", "If she\u2019d wanted it, the crew of Host One would never have reached her bridge.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou\u2019re going to keep them running in circles,\u201d Allyria said slowly. \u201cUntil they bring <i>Bequeathed</i> in close. Once they do...\u201d she bit her lip. Part of her was undeniably eager to see the ship\u2019s vengeance enacted; another part was unsettled by the practiced ease of this manipulation. It seemed like a cruel game, but as she\u2019d already guessed, there was a purpose to it. It cost so little to plant those destructive seeds, to keep the crews working on repairing her while slowly undermining their cohesion.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOnce they do, it will be the endgame,\u201d the machine admitted.<br>", " <br>", "Allyria nodded. So much could go wrong. As injured as she was, the Angel had many blind zones where her control was severed. Other systems were too badly damaged to be quickly restored, still others were working far below capacity. If Usul or his lackeys awoke to the threat around them, <i>Nemesis</i> could die. She had to move slowly, carefully. \u201cThis will only work if Usul doesn\u2019t send for help, but he should have already sent a courier to local command. If a task group comes here...\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cCSFV <i>Bequeathed</i> launched a shift-capable courier drone 53 hours ago,\u201d Red replied, her holographic form shimmering into existence beside Allyria, hands clasped behind her back. The main holo tank sprung to life, showing the drone\u2019s race to Terrahope\u2019s shock limit. There was a second vector line; something was \u2013 or had been, given the time lag \u2013 on an intercept course to the courier. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much,\u201d the ship continued confidently. Her avatar was smiling, a she-wolf\u2019s grin. \u201cMy children are very capable.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<i>At this distance, Terrahope was barely any larger than the rest of the stars at this distance and only the dime, faint glitters of its light reflected off the shards of metal, fragmented circuits and ceramic plates. The killer swept past the expanding cloud of shrapnel, analyzing its handiwork. Nothing remained of its prey. The killer had timed its execution perfectly; milliseconds before the prey drone had warped out-system, the killer had pierced its hull with a single laser strike, the flare of the prey\u2019s death lost in the energy surge of the shockpoint.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>The killer had done this before; it and all its kin had been built and programmed for that single instant, the moment when its prey lowered its defences and diverted its meager power reserves towards breaching space-time. This was the killer\u2019s purpose and it had fulfilled it.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>No help would be coming. No one would know what </i>Bequeathed<i> had discovered, nor that it had called for assistance. Eventually, its disappearance would be noted and other ships sent to investigate. Until then, the Compact cruiser was blissfully unaware of its isolation.</i><br>", " <br>", "<i>New imperatives began to filter through the killer\u2019s mind. The execution confirmed, its attention shifted towards the distant, faded signals of the ship that had launched the courier, alert to any signs of detection. The hours ticked by with no sign that its murder had been noticed; finally, the killer ever so slowly began to ready itself for the next phase of operations.</i><br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "<b><b>Interlude:</b> <b>Encounter 203 [Suspected Incident]</b></b><br>", " <br>", "The axe rasped as its heavy metal head was dragged along the deck, leaving a thin trail of blood behind it. Wet, laboured breathing was interspersed with manic giggles and whispers.<br>", " <br>", "Neriss Ya-than pressed herself against the wall, her heart beating in her chest as listened, the scraping of the axe growing louder as its wielder drew closer, the mumbles becoming loud enough that she could pick out the insanity of their words. \u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d Ideologue Welr (and five names besides) said, laughing to himself. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. So perfect. Symmetry. The Symmetry of meat and metal. Don\u2019t you see?\u201d The Tribune laughed again, but then his manner changed, abruptly shifting from manic laughter to something colder and angrier. \u201cI know you\u2019re there, Didact.\u201d He inhaled deeply. \u201cI can smell you, girl.\u201d His eyes darted around the corridor. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you come out?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Terror flattened the Yttrian\u2019s ears against her skull; she could barely breathe and it was all she could do to slink further into the darkened hallway, afraid that Welr might hear her. She clutched her makeshift weapon, a pitiful bit of scrap that she\u2019d whittled to a point. It would be useless against the ex-Janissary, but it was all she had.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cCome on out, pretty Didact. With your clever theories and witty little thoughts. I do enjoy hearing them. We all did. That\u2019s why we bought you,\u201d Welr purred, pink, frothy saliva dripping from his teeth. \u201cCome on out, won\u2019t you? We have to create symmetry. Beautiful symmetry. It\u2019s what she wants.\u201d Then, screaming: \u201c<i>It\u2019s what she wants!</i>\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Neriss crept further away, listening as Welr\u2019s voice grew softer as the Tribune continued his search for her. Once she reckoned she had put enough distance between her and the mad officer, the Yttrian fled deeper into the dead leviathan\u2019s body.<br>", " <br>", "It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this.<br>", " <br>", "The Unbound clan she belonged to, the Visitors in Blackest Night, had found the wreck when the clan had been searching for a new system to base out of. At the time, Neriss had believed what everyone else had: the Visitors had happened upon the strange corpse purely by chance. Overcome with disbelief at their good fortune, the Visitors had decided to use the broken husk as their new operations center \u2013 it spared them the effort of constructing a new citadel to replace the one the Compact had destroyed. The technology that they could harvest from such a prize had played no small amount in their thinking, either. The clan had set to work repairing the vessel, clustering the ships of their scouting force around it like pups feeding from their mother.<br>", " <br>", "The incidents started happening. Technicians died or disappeared. Accidents; the ship was a broken wreck. <i>Sharp Lilac</i> had been sent to inform the rest of the Visitors of their discovery; it exploded just before shocking out. Battle damage. After interfacing their computers to the hulk\u2019s the frigate <i>Bezelik\u2019s Gauntlet</i> started encountering anomalies across their network. Improper system maintenance. Work teams reported hearing voices. Nerves and fatigue. Everything had an explanation, a perfectly reasonable, logical, rational explanation.<br>", " <br>", "People started seeing things next. Fires. Bodies. Other things. Horrible things. Suit buffers recorded no trace of these apparitions. Data logs showed no indication that the hulk might be responsible. There was a reason for that; obvious in retrospect.<br>", " <br>", "Just before it went off-air, a final transmission had come from <i>Bezelik\u2019s Gauntlet</i>. Not a panicked scream, not a shouted curse or howl of realization. A defeated, pathetic whisper: \u201cIt\u2019s inside.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Neriss whimpered a little at the memory. There was something on this ship. Something awful. Garic, one of her fellow slaves, was an Askanj-<i>renu</i>. He said that they had woken something up, that there was nothing \u2018on\u2019 the ship. It <i>was</i> the ship. His people called them neverborn. Machine minds. The Compact had banned any research into such things and even within the Principality, the penalty for creating a synthetic intelligence was death. The night after Garic had told her of the Rains of Oshanta she\u2019d woken in a cold sweat.<br>", " <br>", "She didn\u2019t know where Garic was now; she hoped he was still alive, but she doubted it. Welr had always hated him; he had probably singled the Askanj-<i>renu</i> out.<br>", " <br>", "Reaching a T-junction, Neriss could see the shifting lights of a static-filled viewscreen and her skin crawled. She started to back away, but the sounds of movement from the other corridor made her hesitate. She didn\u2019t want the ship to notice her, but whatever was in the dark...<br>", " <br>", "The decision was almost paralyzing \u2013 as a slave, she\u2019d never had to worry about making choices. Only following the orders and escaping the beatings or animal\u2019s death of a cut throat. The Yttrian\u2019s tail twitched anxiously, but at last she turned down the lit corridor, reasoning that she might have a chance of seeing any assailants. Neriss carefully picked her way through the gloom, her large pointed ears flicking to and fro; her species had poor night vision, but excellent hearing.<br>", " <br>", "As she drew closer to the screen, it went black, words appearing in Yttrian script.<br>", " <br>", "THERE\u2019S NO WAY OUT<br>", " <br>", "Neriss took a step back, bringing up her shiv as if she expected something to pull itself out of the screen and attack her. \u201cThere are ships,\u201d she said, trying to sound brave. \u201cMore than <i>Bezelik\u2019s Gauntlet.</i> are here. They\u2019ll learn what you\u2019re doing. They\u2019ll kill you.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "An image appeared on the screen, the visual feed from... something. Perhaps one of the hulk\u2019s own scopes, or one of its drone craft \u2013 Neriss couldn\u2019t tell. The view shifted, blurred and then cleared as it focused on... on... \u201cAncestors...\u201d Neriss whispered, covering her mouth with her free hand. It was another of the scouting fleet\u2019s ships. The <i>Banechild</i>, she thought. Its running lights were flickering, sections of the hull lighting up and then going dark in a manic pattern. Thrusters fired randomly, pitching the cutter back and forth. The hull itself...<br>", " <br>", "It was crawling with... with <i>things</i>. Sporadic flashes of light accompanied the cutter\u2019s struggling power grid. Cutting beams. They were carving <i>Banechild</i> apart, slicing into the small ship\u2019s hull as neatly as a surgeon\u2019s scalpel. Neriss felt her gorge rise. The neverborn... it... it...<br>", " <br>", "...it was <i>feeding</i>, she realized with a sickening terror. The scout squadron represented hundreds of thousands of tonnes worth of raw material, already processed and refined. All that remained was breaking it down into digestible chunks. Somewhere aboard this demon-thing, the Yttrian was sure, fabricators and breakers were churning to life, ready to accept the influx of material. It would gorge itself on the Blackest Night, using their own ships to repair itself. Whatever components it could not directly use would be sundered down to their base forms for processing.<br>", " <br>", "The view changed; this time it was <i>Unkind Vagrant</i>. The cutter was dark and lifeless. Its hull was unscarred, with no trace of weapons fire. The infection from <i>Bezelik\u2019s Gauntlet</i>. It had passed to the other ships, shutting them down, leaving them helpless and ready to be slaughtered.<br>", " <br>", "The Didact backed away, shaking her head in denial. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhat are you that can do this? What makes you do this?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The screen went black and the letters returned.<br>", " <br>", "DUTY.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cDuty to what?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The screen remained blank.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cDuty to what?!\u201d Neriss screamed, beating her fists against the monitor until the screen broke, glass shards imbedded in her hands. Blood dripped down her palms. \u201cPlease,\u201d she said to the air. \u201cJust tell me why.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Something heavy rasped over the deck behind her and the Neriss slowly turned. Welr was there.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cFor symmetry,\u201d the Tribune drooled as he lifted his axe and stepped towards the Yttrian...<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Communication with a Compact operative in the Unbound force \u2018Visitors in the Blackest Night\u2019 was lost shortly after a scouting formation disappeared in search of a new lair.

She flashed her ID card to the guard at the gate, anxiously tapping her hands on the wheel of her car as she waited for him to open the checkpoint, scurrying towards the secure terminals. She was out of breath as she stumbled into the locker rooms, pulling off her civilian clothes and tugging on her Compact Space Force (Provisional Status) uniform. Barely remembering her passcard, the young woman hurried to the shuttle bay.<br>", " <br>", "Her shuttle was already beginning its final checklist and Grace sprinted up the ramp, closing the hatch behind her. Breathlessly, she slid into her pilot\u2019s station.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d a low, mellifluous female voice observed and Grace turned, craning her neck to look up at her co-pilot. Allyria te Neu was a Verrish; just over eight feet tall, she looked almost comical in the shuttle\u2019s relatively cramped cockpit. Despite her size, the Verrisha was a lithe thing that moved with a feline grace that her upbringing around humans had done little to change. Her skin was a mottled blue and her slit-pupiled eyes were a vivid yellow-green.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cIt\u2019s the new checkpoints,\u201d Grace sighed as she logged into the shuttle\u2019s system.

There was a shiver of movement from her and Grace watched the taller woman\u2019s long head-tails \u2013 tintas \u2013 undulate jerkily. Each was as long as Grace\u2019s forearm, patterned like a snake\u2019s scales.

He did not look pleased. \u201cOh, crap,\u201d she repeated.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cBreathe,\u201d Allyria advised. \u201cStay calm.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThat\u2019s easy for you to say.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Verrisha nodded. \u201cFinish the power-down checklist. Then we\u2019ll greet the captain.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to use that word,\u201d Grace mumbled absently as she began the shuttle\u2019s shut-down procedure.<br>", " <br>", "Allyria\u2019s tintas flicked dismissively. \u201cUnderstood,\u201d she said in a tone that indicated she was acknowledging what you\u2019d said, but was going to ignore it. Grace was very familiar with that tone. The Verrisha untangled herself from the cramped cockpit, picking up her duffel bag. Grace grabbed hers and followed her co-pilot down the ramp as if trying to hide behind the Verrisha.<br>", " <br>", "Group Leader Usul\u2019s lips curled back from his teeth, each set of eyes focused on his personnel as they stood before him, one meeting his eyes as if she was his equal, the other studiously avoiding his gaze. A Verrisha and a Human. A Brute and a Broken. To be reduced to this....<br>", " <br>", "As he had done on the bridge, Usul made a deliberate show of withdrawing his antique watch from his jacket pocket. \u201cYou are late,\u201d he said. \u201cShuttle Nine-Nine-Three was scheduled for embarkation twenty-three minutes ago. Our departure from orbit has been delayed. Time. Time is the most important aspect of space travel, is it not?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes, Group Leader!\u201d both females said.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes. Yes, it is. Time is all important. Time matters. It matters for everything you do and everyone that relies upon you.\u201d He looked over at the human. The stink of her filled his nostrils. \u201cSectator Citizen Grace Alice Proctor. You have been consistently tardy, despite repeated warnings. This is unacceptable. You were told that if you were late in your duties one more time-\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Verrisha stepped forward. \u201cSectator Proctor was not responsible for our lateness, group leader. It was my fault.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Usul cocked his head towards the Brute. \u201cWas it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYes, patron. I was having difficulty with some software adjustments that delayed our departure.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The Group Leader let a long breath out through his nostrils. Grace watched as Usul considered Allyria\u2019s lie. He was of average height for a Tribune; perhaps seven feet tall and bulky, a trait of his heavy-gravity-world heritage. His black skin was matted with patches of denticles so fine that they were almost like hair. Two pair of eyes stared up at the Verrisha. She stared back, her hands clasped behind her back.<br>", " <br>", "Allyria towered over Usul by nearly a foot, looking down on the Tribune, her lips curling slightly as they always did when she was in the presence of one of the elite. \u201cPatron?\u201d she said after a moment. Not <i>quite</i> challenging him.<br>", " <br>", "Finally, Usul growled. \u201cTo your stations, both of you.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "As a provisional member of the Compact Space Force, Grace was expected to be available for whatever section needed her the most on any given day. She hoped to one day be assigned to a permanent career path \u2013 she knew she showed promise in navigation \u2013 but until that day came, she found herself running errands for the Tribune department heads.<br>", " <br>", "Today, she was serving under Pack Leader Nasham Kem Unoth Ludhy Inku Pram. It was not her favourite posting. True, it was rare for humans to be considered reliable enough to be serve on weapons arrays and Pack Leader Nasham was an accomplished gunnery master; he had earned five names in his service to the Compact. He had been transferred to Rally after some sort of incident during his last posting. No one had spoken of it, but Grace knew that the Pack Leader had had a name stripped from him as a result.<br>", " <br>", "She found Pack Leader Nasham in Torpedo One, on the catwalk above <i>Bequeathed</i>\u2019s four prow-mounted torpedo tubes. As soon as she walked in, the Tribune paused in his inspection, his snout twitching. \u201cAh,\u201d Nasham said, both sets of eyes focusing on Grace. His smaller, upper eyes glinted slightly with reflected light. \u201cMy favourite Broken. What brings you to my department today?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace sketched the pack leader a salute. \u201cSectator Citizen Grace Alice Proctor reporting for duty, patron.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Nasham\u2019s features were unreadable, but there was a slight twist to his lips. \u201cReport to Technician Kilgrave in Battery Three, Sectator.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Robert Kilgrave was a success story. One of the first humans of Rally to be a sanctioned officer in the Compact Space Force, he had served with distinction in the marines. There were even rumours that he had served on Vara, Allyria\u2019s homeworld, helping to keep the peace on that troubled planet. The Verrisha woman despised him. Grace didn\u2019t understand why. The Verrish were a Seventh Phase Encounter species; the Tribunes had discovered Vara only about a quarter-century ago. Grace had even heard the horrifying rumour that the Verrish had resisted the Tribunes \u2013 worse, that they had done so violently. Some species did fight against incorporation into the Compact, but that was only because they didn\u2019t understand all the benefits it could bring. It was fear and ignorance that caused them to act this way. After the Calamity, the Tribunes had been there for the people of Rally and just five years ago, the Tribunes had announced that humanity had, officially, reached another step on the path to full membership in the Compact.<br>", " <br>", "Grace remembered Allyria\u2019s comment during the festivities: \u201cDid they happen to mention how many more steps there are?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace simply didn\u2019t understand the other woman\u2019s bitterness towards the Tribunes. Although she did agree that Sanctioned Technician Sectator Citizen Robert Gordon Kilgrave was... not perhaps as inspirational as his \u2018vid appearances made him seem to be.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAh, there\u2019s my graceful girl,\u201d the section chief smirked at his own joke as Grace arrived, the gesture puckering his scarred features. Half of Kilgrave\u2019s face was twisted into a grimace, courtesy of several parallel scores \u2013 the claws of something very big and very strong. Grace didn\u2019t know why the chief hadn\u2019t had the wounds regenerated. They made him hideous. \u201cGlad you could join us. We\u2019re just running a full break-down and build-up of Battery Nine. An extra pair of hands is always helpful and I know you know your way around a tool.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace\u2019s jaw tightened, but she said nothing. She was only a provisional officer of the fleet; Kilgrave was sanctioned, and he was her superior. Instead, she merely waited at attention. \u201cOrders, patron?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Robert chuckled from deep in his throat. \u201cGo give Smitty a hand in calibrating the EM shunts. But first, pick up that calibrator in the corner.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The young woman looked to where the chief had gestured. There was nothing there. \u201cWhat calibrator, patron?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Kilgrave plucked a calibrator out of a nearby toolkit and tossed it into the corner. \u201cThat calibrator, initiate.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace\u2019s eyes flashed, but she held her tongue, bending over and picking up the tool. She could feel Kilgrave watching. It made her feel dirty. She handed the calibrator to him. \u201cWill that be all, patron?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Smirking, he tossed it back in the box. \u201cYes, initiate. That will be all. For now.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOn your feet, Brute.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Allyria looked up. Sweat was running down her skin, soaking her bodysuit. Her tintas hung limply down her back, themselves drenched in perspiration. Her heart was hammering in her chest and her whole body ached, but she managed to stand again, towering over her opponents.<br>", " <br>", "Demagogue Rensel (and three names besides) circled around her, his hands clasped behind his back as he spoke. \u201cWell?\u201d he demanded of his audience. \u201cWho else?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "There were two dozen humans standing around her, and three Tribunes. None of them stepped forward. Allyria flashed her teeth at Rensel. He chuckled, amused by her defiance. \u201cWhat have we learned?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cWe have learned that a single Brute is more than a match for any Broken,\u201d he eyed his human subordinates distastefully, his lips curled back in disgust. \u201cAnd apparently more than a match for some Tribunes.\u201d His glare intensified when he regarded his fellows. \u201cThis is a single Verrisha female and she has systematically humiliated each and every one of you. Have we learned anything? Brutes are faster and stronger than humans. We Tribunes are stronger, but a Verrish has greater speed and longer reach. I would have called that an even match until today. But none of you have learned a thing. I am disappointed. Combat is not just about physical skill. If it were...\u201d Rensel\u2019s jaw tightened and he cut himself off. \u201cIt is not about physical prowess. Often, it\u2019s the smartest who survives and not the strongest. So far, <i>none</i> of you have impressed me with either of those attributes. The only survivor I see here is this blue bitch.\u201d The demagogue shook his head mournfully. When he raised it again, he was eyeing a pair of humans vindictively. \u201cYou two. Begin.\u201d As the men circled Allyria, Rensel stepped back out of the ring. \u201cLet\u2019s see if you\u2019ve learned anything.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "A flurry of movement later and the Tribune snorted in disgust, watching as the humans picked themselves up, sore and battered. \u201cPathetic. We are not leaving until at least <i>one</i> of you proves to me that you have learned something.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThat won\u2019t work,\u201d a voice interjected.<br>", " <br>", "Rensel turned towards the intruder. A human female with green eyes and a dark blonde mane. Her scent was on the Brute, too. \u201cIdentify yourself,\u201d he growled.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cSectator Citizen Grace Alice Proctor,\u201d the human saluted.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cAh, a Sectator. And a fleet Sectator at that. Hmm. So, Sectator Proctor. You take it upon yourself to find fault with my teaching methods?\u201d the Tribune purred dangerously, all four eyes centered on the small, pale-skinned creature.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou said you wanted someone to show you that they\u2019ve learned something,\u201d Proctor replied.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cThen by all means,\u201d Rensel said, gesturing to the ring. \u201cShow me. If you succeed, the class breaks for lunch. If you don\u2019t...\u201d he smiled. \u201cMy trainees will wait for the end of their shift before they eat.\u201d He looked from the Brute to the human. \u201cBegin.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Before Allyria could move, Grace darted from the circle, slipped between the onlookers and grabbed one of the guns off the wall. She turned and fired. Allyria dropped to one knee as the training splash rounds spattered her with paint.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHold,\u201d Rensel said and both women froze in place. He stalked towards Proctor, his students parting out of his way. \u201cWhat,\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cDid you think you were doing?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cUnarmed combat against a Verrish is unlikely to succeed,\u201d Grace said, coming to attention. \u201cAll you were doing was wearing her down with numbers. That\u2019s not an effective strategy.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Rensel stared at the Broken for a moment before letting out a pleased bark, clapping his hands. \u201cYou see?\u201d he said, turning to face his students. \u201cYou see this? A provisional officer has learned in seconds what I have spent futile hours attempting to have pounded into your useless heads. It is not the strongest that always wins. It is the smartest. I made no mention that this was unarmed combat and each of you made a blithe assumption that has cost us time and energy. I would think that I have failed you as an instructor, save for the fact that this human saw the flaw in your tactics in moments. Think, evaluate, understand and act. That is how battles are won.\u201d He looked back at Proctor and tipped his head in respect. \u201cThank you, Sectator Proctor. You may take your Brute and go.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "The end of the day couldn\u2019t have come sooner for Grace. She had spent her entire shift buried in the guts of a mass driver, tearing it apart and then re-assembling it, all while listening to Kilgrave\u2019s unpleasant comments. Allyria for her part was just as tired. The demagogue liked to use the Verrisha officer as a way to train the more \u2018worthy\u2019 members of his cadre. She was sprawled over her bed, her blue skin marred by dark purple bruises, her tintas hanging limply over her back or dangling from her shoulders.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cHave you checked the duty roster?\u201d the Verrisha said as Grace exited the shower. A private shower was one of the few amenities that came with bunking with the alien woman; traditional quarters for sectators of their rank and status were too small to accommodate someone of Allyria\u2019s size, so she was assigned a cabin normally reserved for trainee Tribune officers, which included a small kitchenette and washroom \u2013 luxuries that the other provisional sectators had to share between themselves.<br>", " <br>", "Grace shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cYou\u2019re with Nasham again,\u201d Allyria commented. She sat up, pulling her shirt off.<br>", " <br>", "Grace averted her eyes from the other girl\u2019s chest, blushing furiously. Verrisha were <i>very</i> similar to humans... she had even heard a rumour that there was some genetic cross-contamination in the development of their species, although Grace had no idea how that could be possible. \u201cThat\u2019s just great,\u201d she sighed as Allyria slid out of her pants, blushing even more and very studiously examining the floor. Nasham\u2019s department meant at least one more day with Kilgrave.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI\u2019ve been assigned to the Pack Leader too,\u201d the Verrisha said as she stepped towards the shower. She flashed a mouth full of very white, very sharp teeth at Grace. Her smiles still weren\u2019t quite right. \u201cAnd that waste of a sperm, sanctioned or not, knows what will happen if he messes with you when I\u2019m around.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cPlease don\u2019t start anything,\u201d Grace pleaded with her roommate as Allyria entered the shower.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d the taller woman promised. \u201cBut I will finish it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Grace sighed. That was as good a promise as she was likely to get.<br>", " <br>", "~<br>", " <br>", "Usul held out his hand, his human steward hurrying to fill his wine glass, backing away once the Tribune signalled enough had been poured. The Group Leader took a sip; a good vintage. Despite its many failings, Rally did produce some truly excellent wines.<br>", " <br>", "His other senior officers all raised their own glasses, only drinking after their leader had done so. \u201cSo,\u201d Usul said. \u201cAnother training cruise for Rally\u2019s Broken has begun. Do I dare wonder if any of them show promise?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "His department heads weren\u2019t quick to point out any candidates, but that was hardly surprising. Humans were little more than apes that had been taught how to dress themselves. They had no technical skill, no understanding of the refinements of proper civilization and only the barest imitation of true intelligence. But the Triarchs insisted that they and all other beast-species be humoured. It was degrading. Insulting. They would never be equal, so why bother with this farce?<br>", " <br>", "<i>Because hope breeds less dissent then despair,</i> Usul could almost hear his father reprimanding him.<br>", " <br>", "\u201cDemagogue Rensel,\u201d Pack Leader Teroshe Vendal spoke up, and heads turned towards her. Though her rank put her on the edge of proprietary for inclusion in this gathering, she was quite a decorative addition to it. \u201cDidn\u2019t I hear that one of your human trainees actually impressed you today?\u201d<br>", " <br>", "The demagogue chuckled. \u201cIf only. No, it was a fleet officer who happened by. Sectator...\u201d he frowned, his lowermost eyes half-closing in thought. \u201cProctor. Yes, that was it.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Usul nearly choked on his wine. \u201cProctor?\u201d he said in amazement. \u201cWell, I suppose anything is possible...\u201d he smiled. \u201cShe was probably looking for her Brute friend. Whatever she did to impress you so doubtless came from that one. Violence is their stock in trade. Well, I suppose even beasts that spend enough time sniffing around each other are bound to pick up things here and there. I wouldn\u2019t count on Proctor to repeat this performance.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "Rensel clicked his teeth together, a very assertive expression. One might even consider it aggressive, a prelude to a challenge in ancient days. \u201cPerhaps, patron. But I consider it wise never to underestimate humans. You were not a part of the Understone Heresies. The officers who underestimated the heretics did not survive long.\u201d<br>", " <br>", "\u201cOn the ground, I\u2019m sure a human with a rock can do a great many things and seem formidable indeed,\u201d Usul said dismissively. \u201cBut, space is the province of the civilized being, demagogue. It requires a keen mind, well-honed instincts and superior intelligence. That is why the Compact rules the stars and not the humans.\u201d He sighed, holding out his glass for more wine. \u201cWell, we shall take <i>Bequeathed</i> out, shock to a nearby system and allow our valued provisional officers and enlisted to gain some experience.

They had found a human survivor fleet. They had tracked it for three weeks, despite all the humans had done to shake pursuit. Human technology was pitiable; they had never really posed a danger to the Tribune, despite the occasional minor victory that they had achieved. Completing the annihilation of the species\u2019 recalcitrant elements had been a necessary, but tedious task. Anselm\u2019s formation had already destroyed three other such forces.
